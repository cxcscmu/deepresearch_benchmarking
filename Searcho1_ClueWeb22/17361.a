As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can certainly help explain how the American Revolution was considered revolutionary. Let's think this through step by step.

First off, the term "revolutionary" in this context likely refers to the idea that the American Revolution brought about significant and profound changes, not just in America but also around the world. So, to understand how it was revolutionary, we need to look at both its immediate impacts on the United States and its broader influence on other nations and political systems.

Let me start by recalling what I know about the American Revolution. It was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783, during which the Thirteen Colonies broke away from British rule and formed the independent United States of America. The revolution was triggered by various factors, including taxation without representation, restrictions on trade, and British military presence in the colonies.

Now, one way the American Revolution was revolutionary was in its ideological foundation. The revolution was fueled by Enlightenment ideas, particularly those related to natural rights, social contracts, and popular sovereignty. These concepts challenged the traditional monarchical and aristocratic orders prevalent in Europe at the time. The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, articulated these ideals, declaring that all men are created equal and endowed with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This was a radical departure from the divine right of kings and the hereditary privileges of the nobility.

Moreover, the revolution led to the establishment of a new form of government based on republican principles. The United States Constitution, ratified in 1788, created a federal republic with separation of powers, checks and balances, and a system of representative democracy. This was a novel experiment in self-government, where power was supposed to reside with the people rather than with a monarch or aristocrats. The constitution also included a bill of rights to protect individual liberties, which was another innovative feature.

Another aspect of the revolution's revolutionary nature was its success in achieving independence through armed struggle against one of the most powerful empires of the time. The colonists' victory inspired other subject peoples around the world to fight for their own independence and self-determination. For instance, the Haitian Revolution and various Latin American independence movements were influenced by the American example.

Furthermore, the American Revolution had economic implications that were revolutionary for its time. The colonists' desire for greater economic autonomy and freedom from British mercantilist policies was a major factor leading to the revolution. After independence, the United States embarked on a path of capitalist development, which contrasted with the more controlled economies of European nations. This emphasis on free markets and individual enterprise became a hallmark of the American system.

Additionally, the revolution led to significant social changes within the United States. While slavery persisted, the revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality inspired debates about the institution and laid the groundwork for future abolitionist movements. Women, too, began to question their roles in society and advocate for greater rights, although meaningful reforms would take decades to materialize.

Internationally, the American Revolution served as a catalyst for the French Revolution, which began in 1789. The ideas and events in America influenced French thinkers and revolutionaries, who sought to apply similar principles to transform their own society. The French Revolution, in turn, had far-reaching effects across Europe and beyond.

In summary, the American Revolution was revolutionary in several ways: it introduced new political ideas and institutions based on Enlightenment principles, successfully challenged imperial authority, inspired other independence movements, fostered economic liberalism, and spurred social change and reform movements.

To ensure I haven't missed any important points, maybe I should do a quick search to verify and perhaps find some additional perspectives.

Was the American Revolution Really Revolutionary?
During the Age of Revolution (1774-1849), many revolutionary movements occurred in Europe and the Americas. One of the most revolutionary revolutions was the French Revolution, a period of social and political upheaval in France that resulted in an upswing of nationalism, as well as the decline of monarchies and the rise of Democracy. The entire political and social structure of France was overthrown as a result of The French Revolution, making it one of the most radical revolutions of its time.
The American Revolution didn’t have many immediate effects on the social and economic structure regarding slaves and women, but because the United States was the first formerly European colony to successfully achieve independence and adopt a Democratic form of government,there was more religious tolerance, and economic and social structures such as mercantilism and aristocracy faded, the American Revolution was truly revolutionary.

The idea that all men are created equal was the basis of the fight for independence in the Americas. The idea of equality originated in the minds of American elites, because of their desire to be seen as equal and no longer inferior to the British elites. But when Thomas Paine described America as unique and as a child of Europe, Americans wanted independence from their parent country, Britain. After the revolution, the United States of America was established and this new nation adopted a Democracy. Although the attempt to establish a direct Democracy failed because the elite came to realize that citizens participating in the legislative process directly could lead to self-oppression in larger, more populated states, the Founding Fathers decided that a Democratic Republic was more attainable for Americans. In this Democratic Republic, constituents were able to elect officials from their states to serve on behalf of them. This form of government was more centralized and very different from that of Europe, which was a goal of Americans. The Constitution established this new form of government and set up the separation of powers. In Europe, parliament made the laws, enforced the laws, and judged the law and the Founding Fathers, more specifically James Madison, declared that The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary was the very definition of tyranny. So, the first three articles in the Constitution establish the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of government. The idea of checks and balances described the process of each branch checking the other branches to secure a balance of power. The establishment of the American Republic and the constitution are significant changes that not only affected Americans and the British, but also inspired other revolutions around the world.
Before the revolution, many people of faiths different from the established religion in each colony faced religious intolerance. In Rhode Island, Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were ostracized for their disagreements over belief. Similarly, In the Massachusetts Bay, four Quakers were hanged for standing up and speaking about their beliefs. But the Catholics faced the most discrimination. Catholics, especially Spanish and French Catholics, were banned from holding public office and had little to no political rights. Prejudice and bigotry regarding religion persisted throughout the colonies until after the American Revolution when Thomas Jefferson, inspired by John Locke, declared that all religions should be tolerated and people running for public office shouldn’t be judged based on their religious beliefs. This is known as the separation of church and state and is the first amendment of the constitution. This amendment gave constituents more religious freedom and the ability to participate in political affairs. The American Revolution was the main factor that contributed to religious tolerance and the acceptance for people of all beliefs, and without the revolution many people in the colonies would be ostracized and oppressed just based on their religious differences.
With the revolution came many economic and social changes, one of which being the end of mercantilism.The imposition of taxes on goods and restrictions for trade on the colonies by parliament frustrated the colonists and became a factor in the revolution. The British restricted how the colonies could spend money, what they could produce, and who they could trade with. After achieving independence, Mercantilism was terminated and there were no longer restrictions on trade. And along with Mercantilism, the practice of primogeniture ended. Instead of the eldest son of an elite inheriting an entire estate, people were able to own property and attain social mobility. This meant that no one could gain nobility based on the family they were born into, which also ended the Aristocratic system. Along with all these changes, education became more important to Democracy. The idea of Republican Motherhood meant that women were to be educated so that they could teach their children about Republicanism. This gave women more freedom and drive to educate themselves and express their religious and political views.
The United States was not only the first colony to establish independence from Europe, but also the first Republic Democracy, one of the only nations to abandon the mercantilist system, and establish a constitution that separated governmental powers and separated religion and government, which couldn’t have happened without the American Revolution. Therefore, the American Revolution was truly revolutionary.

4. (Contextualization) Historical Context: Britain fought to protect the 13 colonies in the French and Indian War, which took place 1754-1763. The war was costly, so when it ended, Britain increased taxes on its colonies. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution fought against an unfair use of power? Explain.
5. (Contextualization) Historical Context: The colonists had no representatives in Parliament, the body of Britain’s government that makes laws, so the colonists had no say in how Britain taxed them. Taxation without representation was one of the biggest complaints of revolutionaries. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution fought against an unfair use of power? Explain.
Yes because when Britain fought to protect the 13 colonies in the War of France and India, Britain lost a lot of money, men and weapons, so all that situation give America a chance to declare war and have a greater chance of winning .Yes, America argues that it is necessary to end acts of parliament that violate human rights

3. (Contextualization): The creation of the United States allowed for Southern slavers, and specifically plantation owners, to hold much more power over the institution of slavery. In fact, it took nearly 100 years after the U.S. War of Independence for slavery to end, and only through a Civil War. Britain banned slavery in 1833, 30 years before the Emancipation Proclamation in the U.S. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary? Explain. Though the Revolution did not lead to abolition of slavery, it set off a process of both immediate and gradual emancipation in northern states. The South’s slave system suffered because of the war, which resulted in a decline in production and a loss of thousands of slaves to the British. Though a small number of slaveholders, particularly in Virginia, emancipated their slaves after the Revolution, slavery remained entrenched in the southern states and would only become more profitable and spread further to the west and south during the late eighteenth and into the nineteenth century.

Within the red lines, how is that section labelled (hint, turn your head to the left when you read). What is the purpose of this boundary and how does it relate to the Royal Proclamation of 1763? King George III, 1763 The red lines were the british colonies and the purpose of this boundary was separating british colonies on
King George III , 1763 The red lines were the british colonies and the purpose of this boundary was separating british colonies on
Document B: A Timeline of Slavery and the Early U.S. Government 1. (Sourcing): What type of source is this (primary or secondary)? Primary
Primary
the atlantic coast from the american indian lands.
5. (Contextualization) Historical Context: This proclamation greatly angered colonists who would soon rebel against the British crown. Colonists saw westward expansion in First Nation territory as their right, and only saw the British Proclamation of 1793 as an obstacle to settler-colonial goals. This added to the list of grievances that colonists had with how the British throne monitored business, enterprise, and land use, and increased support for the War for the U.S. Independence. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary? Explain. The american Revolution was a movement that was intended to keep the existing social, political, and economic order. The cause was that colonial opposition to the british attempts which caused a bigger control over the colonies. This mostly supports the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary because it caused an increase in support for the war for US independence and the conflict they had.

Document D: Abigail and John Adams (Excerpted and Modified) 1. (Sourcing) Who wrote this? Who was the audience? Personal letters between Abigail and John Adams, 1776.
George Washington , It was for General public and government officials .
2. (Sourcing) What might this document be trustworthy and useful for learning about? Explain. This document is trustworthy since these are actual letters between Abigail and john adam which is seen as real evidence since it's a primary source.
It shows that this conflict was very important for us and that with this conflict the northeastern nations of the United States , New York and Pennsylvania emerged .
3. (Close reading) What did Abigail Adams ask John Adams to do? What reasons did she give? 4. (Close reading) What do Abigail and John Adams’s letters suggest about how different segments of society were participating in the revolution? Abigail Adams asked John Adams to not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands and to keep the interest of women in mind when they are going to prepare to fight for american independence. Abigail's letter shows how he asked John to not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands but in John's letters it seemed like their society is unsteady and in conflict and it says “This is rather too coarse a compliment, but you are so saucy that I won't blot it out.Depend on it, we know better than to get rid of our masculine systems.” This shows how they arent going to take inconsideration what Abigail asked for.

6. (Contextualization) Historical Context: Women participated in the revolution in many ways—by writing political commentaries condemning Britain, supporting boycotts of British goods, joining riots, taking on additional household responsibilities while the men of their families fought in the war, and more. Despite women’s participation, extending women’s rights never became a widespread demand during the revolution, and women’s rights remained as highly restricted after the revolution as before. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary? Explain. Women participating in the revolution did not make the american revolution truly revolutionary because even after women were boycotting and women's rights still stayed in place, nothing changed.

4. (Contextualization) Historical Context: Jefferson declared that the King of Great Britain had created many “new offices and sent swarms of officers to harass our people.” According to historians, this description of colonial officers is unrealistic. Historians also argue that Jefferson’s claim that colonists had been taken overseas to be tried for fake offenses is untrue. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary? Explain. No, because it was nothing more than lies created by Jefferson to make people revolt with Great Britain.
No , because it was nothing more than lies created by Jefferson to make people revolt with Great Britain .
5. (Contextualization) Historical Context: Jefferson wrote that the King of Great Britain had “destroyed the lives of our people.” Within the British Empire, colonial subjects were supposed to be loyal to Britain and, in return, Britain was supposed to protect subjects’ lives and property. Does this historical context support the argument that the American Revolution was truly revolutionary? Explain.
His response was that he would n't listen to abigail 's wishes in his letter , instead he responded how much he knows better than to get rid of their masculine systems .

Use a quote or paraphrase “These compromises on slavery had serious effects on the nation. The fugitive slave clause (enforced through legislation passed in 1793 and 1850) allowed escaped slaves to be chased into the North and caught. It also resulted in the illegal kidnapping and return to slavery of thousands of free blacks. The three-fifths compromise increased the South’s representation in Congress and the Electoral College. In 12 of the first 16 presidential elections, a Southern slave owner won. Extending the slave trade past 1800 brought many slaves to America. South Carolina alone imported 40,000 slaves between 1803 and 1808 (when Congress overwhelmingly voted to end the trade). So many slaves entered that slavery spilled into the Louisiana territory and took root.” D Detailed Analysis Explain how the evidence you provided supports your topic or proves your thesis This means, that though the Revolution did not lead to abolition of slavery, it set off a process of both immediate and gradual emancipation in northern states. The South’s slave system suffered because of the war, which resulted in a decline in production and a loss of thousands of slaves to the British.

From 1765 to 1784, an upheaval known as the American Revolution took place, forming the United States of America.  It was evident that the colonies rejected British authority and declared themselves independent; however, what is not evident is whether this “American Revolution” was truly a revolution or a coup performed by the upper class for their own benefit.  By definition, a “revolution” is a forcible overthrow of a government or social order in favor of a new system, while a “coup” is just a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.  Although the American Revolution was a seizure of power from British government, it was in fact a true revolution proven by the political justice that derived from the creation of a republic, economic freedom from decreased restrictions, and social equity from campaigns, creating a new system that served to improve the lives of not only upper class men, but …show more content…
The American Revolution was a major influence to the French Revolution, where the French attempted to create new systems of politics and society.  They succeeded by gaining more representation and opposing absolutism, and increasing their campaigns for women’s right.  Although both the French and American Revolutions were seizures of power from the government, they were also radical transformations of change from old systems to new systems.

Every 4th of July, Americans are told the story of the American Revolution. We remember the oppressed colonists fighting against the tyrannical King George III  and the formidable red coats. Patriotic heroes are remembered, evil kings are cursed, and the liberties and freedoms won from the war are celebrated. Though America often likes to look back to the revolution, the question of just how much a revolution was the American Revolution is rarely asked. While the American revolution was not as radical of a revolution as we like to remember today, it still changed the political, social, and ideological aspects substantially of the thirteen colonies. Americans deservedly have to rite to remember the revolution, regardless to the fact of if there was true reason to start one, as a true full fledged revolution.
To decide just how much of a revolution the American Revolution was, one has to first explain what a revolution is. As defined by Princeton University, a revolution
'The overthrow of a government by those who are governed'
In accordance with this definition, for a protest to considered revolution, the established government must be overthrown by the people it governs over. The American Revolution easily fulfills this definition.  The British government was overthrown by those it governed, the colonists. Since this criteria is met, the American Revolution can be considered a technical revolution. But to understand of just how much of a revolution the separation of America and Britain was, one has to look at the changes made in the political, legislative, and ideological aspects in colonial life.
The biggest change in America after the revolution was the colonies political system. Before the revolution the colonies were governed by Britain’s parliament. Parliament is not to much different from what Americans know congress to be today.  Lead by the Prime Minister, parliament was filled with appointed officials to make and vote’s political decisions, such as congress does today. There are distinct differences between parliament and the congress though. First, a spot in parliament was (with the exception of the House of Commons) either appointed to you by the king, or was a birth right position. There was little decision from the people as to who would govern them.

Was the American Revolution a Revolution?
About this page
In American History class my junior year of high school, we discussed what is required for an event to be considered a revolution and then had to write whether the American Revolution was a true revolution. I wrote this essay explaining that it was a true revolution.
All of us alive today have grown up learning about the American Revolution. Although it contains the word “revolution” in its name, there are many who don’t consider the American Revolution a real revolution. After considering the definition of a revolution – a radical change of an entire system, usually by war, resulting in a change of the way of life of the people involved – and the American society before and after the American Revolution, it is obvious that those who don’t consider the American Revolution a revolution are mistaken. Among the many aspects of colonial society affected by the American Revolution, those most greatly affected by the revolution were the attitude towards slavery, the role of women, and the role of trade.
The Civil War, as well as events associated with it, being a large part of our history, is taught to all children in America at an early age. Growing up, we are taught the evils of slavery and how slaves were treated poorly. The evils about which we’ve been taught were actually occurring prior to the American Revolution. Over the course of the revolution, the attitude toward and treatment of slaves changed.
Before the American Revolution, many people, though not all, thought of slaves as “subhuman” or as animals. Even among those who gave the slaves the good treatment they deserved, there was still a feeling that the whites were better than the slaves. How many black people did could have been seen living in their nice house with a few white slaves? None; that sight was non-existent. The few black people who were free had little money. Had they been wealthy, there was still no way they ever would have found a white person who would have been their slave. Nor would that have been allowed.
As the revolution progressed, though, the role of slaves and the attitude toward them changed. The patriots needed all the help they could get to fight off the British. A law was made that allowed all slaves who fought in the war to be free after one year of fighting. The slave’s owner, of course, had to consent. Over the course of the revolution, the concept of a slave went from a lowly character to a person of worth – anybody fighting for the colonies was respected for standing up for the rights of the colonies.
While slavery existed many years before the American Revolution, so did the ideal ideas of the roles of men and women in society. Men were traditionally the ones to go out and work the land and to provide for the family, while women traditionally worked around the house – cooking, cleaning, working with the children, washing, and performing other duties of the sort. These traditions were mostly brought about as a result of Adam’s and Eve’s actions in the Garden of Eden. The Bible says, in 1 Timothy 2:14-15, “ Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; but she will be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety. ” It was the first woman’s actions that brought about the traditional role of women in society.
At the beginning of the revolution, the traditional roles of men and women still existed among the colonists. Mary Silliman’s War showed the duties of women around the household before the war. Mary, the main character, did all the cooking, cleaning, washing, etc. in the house. Her life was the life of a typical woman at the time. She didn’t go out and work in the fields, as the slaves did, or work in an office, as her husband did.
As the story continued, though, Mary Silliman’s role in the war showed some gradual changes in the roles of women. Once Mary’s husband was captured, she missed him very much (as one could easily guess, especially since she was pregnant). Mary didn’t know how to function without her husband – she didn’t know how to run the farm. Regardless, Mary learned. Not only did she help manage the slaves, instruct them as to what to do, and sell the crops to the army, she also worked to get her husband back. She went against the traditions of the time and met with men in high-up places to discuss getting her husband back. There was a classic example showing the change when a man came to Mary’s house to discuss a plan he had. He suggested that he and some other men go and kidnap a loyalist judge on the British “side.” She refused. At first, the man tried persuading her, but when she continued to resist, he listened. He said something to the effect of, “As you wish, madam.” Colonial society went from the men making all the important decisions to the small step of allowing women to make a few important decisions.
Slavery and gender roles in society were not the only prominent issues affected by the American Revolution. People in early colonial society weren’t always able to provide everything they needed for themselves off their land. They had to go elsewhere to get the supplies they considered necessary. Before the American Revolution, the colonies and Britain traded back and forth. Because the idea of mercantilism existed at the time and Britain was using the colonies to make money for itself, Britain often made laws that made the colonists unhappy. The events that had the greatest impact on the start of the American Revolution were the making of controlling laws by Britain. Britain taxed almost everything possible – molasses, tea, stamps on official documents, stamps on cards, and many imported goods. Britain made all sorts of outrageous laws, including a law preventing colonists from going west of the Appalachian Mountains, and laws against trade with other countries besides Britain. Britain had absolute authority over the American trade system.
With the American Revolution, the whole trade system changed. Although it was still the same basic idea – you can’t really deviate from the idea of trade and still call it trade – Britain was no longer involved in making the colonies’ decisions. The colonies could make their own laws about trade (once the Constitution was written). The colonies, not Britain, could decide who they traded with and what taxes they charged; they had complete control over the system of trade.
The term “revolution” requires a radical change of an entire system that changes people’s lives. Slavery, the attitudes toward women, and the trade system were only a few parts of the entire system that changed during the American Revolution. (Not to mention the change in government from a Monarchy to a Democracy!!!!!) People’s lives have been different ever since the American Revolution. Had the colonists never broken away from Britain, we wouldn’t be studying American history. Rather, we’d be studying British history. The large step of breaking away from England has radically changed the way the colonists lived and has had a huge influence on the way we live today.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How was the American Revolution revolutionary?" Now, I need to think about what makes a revolution revolutionary. I remember that a revolution is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time. So, for the American Revolution to be considered revolutionary, it must have brought about significant and lasting changes in the political, social, and economic spheres of the American colonies.

First off, let's recall what the American Revolution was. It was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783, during which the Thirteen Colonies broke away from British rule and formed the independent United States of America. The revolution was driven by various factors, including taxation without representation, restrictions on trade, and British military presence in the colonies.

Now, to assess whether this was revolutionary, I need to look at what changed as a result of the revolution and how these changes impacted the lives of people in the newly formed United States.

Let me start by considering the political changes. Prior to the revolution, the colonies were under the governance of the British monarchy and parliament. After the revolution, the United States established a republic with a constitution that enshrined principles of democracy, separation of powers, and protection of individual rights. This shift from monarchy to republic is a significant political transformation, which aligns with the idea of a revolution.

Moreover, the Declaration of Independence, with its assertion of natural rights and the right to alter or abolish an oppressive government, was a radical departure from the prevailing monarchical systems in Europe. This document inspired similar movements elsewhere, contributing to a wave of revolutions in the Atlantic world.

Economically, the revolution led to changes in trade policies and economic structures. The end of British mercantilist policies allowed the United States to engage in trade with other nations more freely, fostering economic growth and independence. Additionally, the revolution paved the way for the development of a more diverse economy, moving away from the colonial reliance on Britain for manufactured goods.

Socially, the revolution had mixed impacts. On one hand, it led to increased opportunities for some groups, such as white males who gained more political rights and participation. On the other hand, the revolution did not immediately address issues like slavery or women's rights, which remained largely unchanged or even saw some regression in certain aspects.

However, it's important to note that the revolution did plant seeds for future social reforms. The ideals espoused during the revolution, such as equality and liberty, were later invoked in movements to abolish slavery and grant women's suffrage. So, while immediate social changes were limited, the revolution set the stage for long-term social evolution.

Internationally, the American Revolution served as an inspiration for other colonial societies seeking independence from European powers. It demonstrated that a group of colonies could successfully break away from a powerful mother country and establish a new nation based on democratic principles. This had a profound influence on subsequent revolutions, including the Haitian Revolution and the Latin American independence movements.

Moreover, the revolution's emphasis on constitutional government and the rule of law influenced political thought and practice worldwide. The U.S. Constitution, with its system of checks and balances and Bill of Rights, became a model for other nations drafting their own constitutions.

In terms of its impact on the indigenous populations, however, the revolution had negative consequences. The victory of the United States led to expanded territorial claims and increased displacement of Native American tribes as westward expansion accelerated.

So, considering all these factors, it's clear that the American Revolution was indeed revolutionary in many respects. It brought about significant political changes, established new governing principles, and had far-reaching effects on economic and social structures, both in the United States and beyond.

But, to ensure I have a comprehensive understanding, maybe I should look up some scholarly perspectives or historical analyses on this topic. Perhaps there are nuanced arguments or differing viewpoints that I should consider.

Let me try conducting a quick search to gather more information.

From 1765 to 1784, an upheaval known as the American Revolution took place, forming the United States of America.  It was evident that the colonies rejected British authority and declared themselves independent; however, what is not evident is whether this “American Revolution” was truly a revolution or a coup performed by the upper class for their own benefit.  By definition, a “revolution” is a forcible overthrow of a government or social order in favor of a new system, while a “coup” is just a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.  Although the American Revolution was a seizure of power from British government, it was in fact a true revolution proven by the political justice that derived from the creation of a republic, economic freedom from decreased restrictions, and social equity from campaigns, creating a new system that served to improve the lives of not only upper class men, but …show more content…

Was the American Revolution Really Revolutionary?
During the Age of Revolution (1774-1849), many revolutionary movements occurred in Europe and the Americas. One of the most revolutionary revolutions was the French Revolution, a period of social and political upheaval in France that resulted in an upswing of nationalism, as well as the decline of monarchies and the rise of Democracy. The entire political and social structure of France was overthrown as a result of The French Revolution, making it one of the most radical revolutions of its time.
The American Revolution didn’t have many immediate effects on the social and economic structure regarding slaves and women, but because the United States was the first formerly European colony to successfully achieve independence and adopt a Democratic form of government,there was more religious tolerance, and economic and social structures such as mercantilism and aristocracy faded, the American Revolution was truly revolutionary.

The idea that all men are created equal was the basis of the fight for independence in the Americas. The idea of equality originated in the minds of American elites, because of their desire to be seen as equal and no longer inferior to the British elites. But when Thomas Paine described America as unique and as a child of Europe, Americans wanted independence from their parent country, Britain. After the revolution, the United States of America was established and this new nation adopted a Democracy. Although the attempt to establish a direct Democracy failed because the elite came to realize that citizens participating in the legislative process directly could lead to self-oppression in larger, more populated states, the Founding Fathers decided that a Democratic Republic was more attainable for Americans. In this Democratic Republic, constituents were able to elect officials from their states to serve on behalf of them. This form of government was more centralized and very different from that of Europe, which was a goal of Americans. The Constitution established this new form of government and set up the separation of powers. In Europe, parliament made the laws, enforced the laws, and judged the law and the Founding Fathers, more specifically James Madison, declared that The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary was the very definition of tyranny. So, the first three articles in the Constitution establish the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of government. The idea of checks and balances described the process of each branch checking the other branches to secure a balance of power. The establishment of the American Republic and the constitution are significant changes that not only affected Americans and the British, but also inspired other revolutions around the world.
Before the revolution, many people of faiths different from the established religion in each colony faced religious intolerance. In Rhode Island, Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were ostracized for their disagreements over belief. Similarly, In the Massachusetts Bay, four Quakers were hanged for standing up and speaking about their beliefs. But the Catholics faced the most discrimination. Catholics, especially Spanish and French Catholics, were banned from holding public office and had little to no political rights. Prejudice and bigotry regarding religion persisted throughout the colonies until after the American Revolution when Thomas Jefferson, inspired by John Locke, declared that all religions should be tolerated and people running for public office shouldn’t be judged based on their religious beliefs. This is known as the separation of church and state and is the first amendment of the constitution. This amendment gave constituents more religious freedom and the ability to participate in political affairs. The American Revolution was the main factor that contributed to religious tolerance and the acceptance for people of all beliefs, and without the revolution many people in the colonies would be ostracized and oppressed just based on their religious differences.
With the revolution came many economic and social changes, one of which being the end of mercantilism.The imposition of taxes on goods and restrictions for trade on the colonies by parliament frustrated the colonists and became a factor in the revolution. The British restricted how the colonies could spend money, what they could produce, and who they could trade with. After achieving independence, Mercantilism was terminated and there were no longer restrictions on trade. And along with Mercantilism, the practice of primogeniture ended. Instead of the eldest son of an elite inheriting an entire estate, people were able to own property and attain social mobility. This meant that no one could gain nobility based on the family they were born into, which also ended the Aristocratic system. Along with all these changes, education became more important to Democracy. The idea of Republican Motherhood meant that women were to be educated so that they could teach their children about Republicanism. This gave women more freedom and drive to educate themselves and express their religious and political views.
The United States was not only the first colony to establish independence from Europe, but also the first Republic Democracy, one of the only nations to abandon the mercantilist system, and establish a constitution that separated governmental powers and separated religion and government, which couldn’t have happened without the American Revolution. Therefore, the American Revolution was truly revolutionary.

Okay, so I've got these search results. Let's see what they say.

First, there's a page from erichmusick.com where someone wrote an essay about whether the American Revolution was a true revolution. They argue that it was, because it brought about significant political, economic, and social changes. They mention changes in attitudes toward slavery, the role of women, and trade policies. They also point out that the revolution inspired other movements and had international impacts. This seems like a solid starting point.

Next, there's a Cram.com page with a summary of the American Revolution as a true revolution. It touches on similar points: political changes, the establishment of a democracy, and influences on other revolutions like the French Revolution. It reinforces the idea that the American Revolution was indeed revolutionary.

Then, there's a PapersOwl.com essay that discusses how the American Revolution led to a democratic form of government, increased religious tolerance, and the end of mercantilism and aristocracy. It emphasizes that the revolution inspired other independence movements and had a global influence. This aligns with what I've read so far.

There's also a 123HelpMe.com essay that acknowledges that the American Revolution was a revolution because it overthrew British rule and established a new government. It notes that while it may not have been as radical as some other revolutions, it still brought about significant changes in politics, society, and ideology.

Lastly, there's a Wikipedia disambiguation page for "American Revolution," which primarily lists different uses of the term, such as the American Revolutionary War and various books and media related to the topic. It's more of a directory than a source of information for my question.

Overall, these sources consistently present the American Revolution as a genuine revolution due to its profound impact on politics, society, and economics, both in the United States and internationally.

But to ensure I have a well-rounded understanding, maybe I should look for some counterarguments or different perspectives. Perhaps there are historians who argue that the American Revolution wasn't as revolutionary as it's made out to be.

Let me try another search.

Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?
Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?
| No Comments
From the time after the American Revolution to present day, historians have debated whether the American Revolution was Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary. Two views formed from this question. Some historians see
the revolution as based on the desire of independence from Britain. Others argue the Revolution happened because of a “violent social upheaval”. These historians say the lower classes during the colonial era wanted a more democratic society. From these views, five schools of though developed.
The nationalist or patriotic school was the first one to develop after the Revolution. The theme of this this school was that “American history was the quest for liberty.” They believe the Revolution was solely to achieve the goal of self-rule. Due to the time period of when this school was developed its probable that the schools views were because of the lingering feelings of patriotism and nationalism. George Brancroft was a historian during the time of the schools development he saw that the American Revolution was a phase in a plan that when completed would bring all of humankind to greater freedom.
In the late 1800’s America and Britain were having good relations. Historians began to look at the past relations (between Britain and the colony’s) and see things differently. This is when the Imperial school developed. The Imperial school believed that political and constitutional issues caused the revolution. The Imperial school included historians George L. Beer, Charles M. Andrews and Lawrence H. Gipson. These historians said that the revolutionary views could not be limited to the history of America alone but “considered as an integral part of the history of the British Empire as a whole” These historians claimed that Britain was more fair than the nationalist and patriotic school had made Britain to be. They believed that under British rule British rule the colonies had actually been prosperous. Andrews stated that the British protected “America’s goods and ships.” Gipson argues that the taxation of the colonies was fair because of the fact the British blood was spilt and British money was spent “defending the North American colonies in the Great War for Empires.” However, Beer, Andrews, and Gipson believe that “constitutional issues” brought the disagreement between Britain and the colonies. They say Britain and the colonies clashed as the colonies pushed for different goals, the colonies moving toward self-government while the British pushed for more control over the colonies. Concluding that despite the Beer, Andrews and Gipson’s softer view of Britain during the colonial milestone the Imperial school still believed that the American Revolution was revolutionary. World War II brought the Neo-Conservative school of historians.
The Progressive school was the first school to see a completely different point of view; they believed that the revolution was a result of economic and social issues. These historians emphasized the conflicts between the lower and upper classes. Historians of this school were devoted to the “reform movement of the early 1900’s” they, themselves wanted to break away from large corporations of “modern America”. Looking back at the time of the colonial America, they saw many similarities between the two timeframes. Progressive historians, Carl L. Becker, Charles A. Beard, Arthur M. Schlesinger and J Franklin Jameson believed “materialistic factors – not ideological- were the major determinists in history.” Progressive historians believed that mostly self-economic interests motivated man. They argued that any political interest was a result of an economic interest. Becker said the American Revolution was actually two revolutions. The first revolution was an “external revolution”. Being when the colonies rebelled because of a “clash of economic interests” between Britain and the colonies. The second Revolution was an “Internal conflict”. This being between the colonies upper and lower classes, to determine which class would rule after gaining independence from the British. In other words two questions. “The question of home rule” and the question of “who should rule at home”. Beard came up with a hypothesis that the events during the era “mirrored a split between American society”, being conflicts between “rich and poor” and the “creditors and debtors”, between the haves and the have-nots. Schlesinger argues that merchants got angry about the British policies enforced after the French and Indian war, though they failed to act against the British for fear the might loser power to the lower classes. After independence, however they became active members in newly developed government and created the constitution to help gain “control of the government”.
World War II brought upon a new school being the neo-conservative school. They, unlike the progressive school believed the American society during the colonial era was democratic and that the Revolution was “conservative act“, initiated in order to preserve the life the colonists had began to live. When the British began to enforce laws in the colonies after the period of governing themselves the colonists rebelled.  Historians of this school argue that the freedoms of people were based on principles that should not be changed without there approval. Robert E. Brown and Daniel J. Boortsin saw the harmony and the widespread compromise to keep the government that the colonies had already established, that there was not a class struggle. They said the colonies had no intent to change the government after they gained independence from Britain to “maintain the status quo. Boorstin says that when Britain tried to tax them for the French and Indian war it contradicted the British constitution. When the colonists would not pay taxation without representation, they were protecting a right they already had. Boorstin said the “patriots more true followers of the British Constitution than the British were themselves”. He said that they colonists still recognized their British heritage and carried many British principles over into the new nation. Concluding the Neo- Conservative School also believed that the revolution was revolutionary.
World War II also brought the Intellectual School who held no group of historians but felt that the revolution was not revolutionary; it was solely about bringing the separation of the colonies from British Rule. Neo- Conservative historian Edmund S. Morgan disagreed and said that he believed the colonists were “derived from natural law” higher then the British Constitution and that the resistance was consequential from “ideological” roots and was something the colonists were devoted to.
Hence, the question “Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?”, brought upon two views one that is was based on the desire of independence from Britain and the other being the Revolution happened because of a “violent social upheaval”. These views stemmed out to five schools of though on the topic being the nationalist or patriotic, the imperial, the progressive the neo-conservative and the intellectual schools. Nationalist or patriotic, the imperial, and the neo-conservative believed the revolution was revolutionary although they had different reasons for believing so while the progressive and intellectual schools believed the revolution was un-revolutionary being for self interests of the upper class.

The Case Against the Case Against the American Revolution
Some on both left and right argue that the American Revolution was a mistake that ultimately caused more harm than good. Here's why they're wrong.
Ilya Somin|7.4.2019 10:22 PM
Washington Crossing the Delaware. Painting by Emmanuel Leutze (1851).

July 4 is almost over. But there is still time to  address claims that history would have taken a better course had the American Revolution failed (or never started). In the United States, such arguments are made mostly by people on the left. This 2015 Vox article by Dylan Matthews is an excellent example. But similar claims are also made by a few libertarians, such as my George Mason University colleague Bryan Caplan, and by some Canadian and British conservatives. Here are the main arguments typically advanced by modern critics of the Revolution (most elaborated at greater length at the links above):
1. British rule would have led to an earlier and less violent abolition of slavery. The British Empire abolished slavery in 1833, some thirty years before the United States. And it did not require a bloody civil war to do it.
2. A British-ruled America would have treated Native Americans better (as witness their apparently superior treatment in Canada).
3. A British America would have had a parliamentary form of government rather than separation of powers, which - among other advantages - would have led to a larger welfare and regulatory state. This latter point, of course, is usually made by left of center critics of the Revolution, not conservative and libertarian ones.
4. The history of Canada (and later Australia and New Zealand) shows that the British Empire was capable of gradually granting colonies increased autonomy and rights without the need for a bloody revolt.
5. The Revolutionary War caused enormous bloodshed. Some 25,000 Americans died (a larger percentage of the population than were lost in any of our other wars, besides the Civil War). To that figure, we should add numerous casualties suffered by British and French troops, and by German mercenary soldiers hired by the British. The possible gains of the Revolution were not enough to justify this terrible loss of life.
This is a weighty critique that Americans should take seriously. We should not adopt a blindly celebratory attitude to our history, but should instead seek out the truth. Still, the critique falls short.
Here are my responses:
1. Far from retarding the abolition of slavery, the Revolution actually accelerated it. Its triumph gave a big boost to Enlightenment liberalism, which inspired the First Emancipation in the US (the abolition of slavery in the North that became the first large-scale emancipation of slaves in modern history), and boosted antislavery movements in Europe, as well.
2. Had the Revolution been defeated, Enlightenment liberal ideology would have been dealt a setback in Britain and France, too. That would have set back antislavery movements there, as well. It is no accident that many antislavery leaders in Europe were also sympathizers with the American Revolution. The Marquis de Lafayette was just one of the most famous examples of European liberals who actively backed both.
3. The West Indian slaveowner lobby in Parliament was strong enough to block abolition of slavery until 1833. Had Britain also been saddled with the much larger proslavery lobby of the American South, it would have taken far longer. Especially when you combine the impact of the larger slavery lobby with the force of point 2 above.
4. A defeat for the American Revolution would have set back other liberal causes too, not just antislavery. That includes, among other things, universal suffrage, freedom of speech, religious toleration, and increased rights for women. Each of these reforms (and others, too) was given new impetus by American Revolution, which inspired European liberals to imitate them.
Ideally, people should evaluate political ideas purely on the basis of logic and evidence. But, in reality, many are often attracted to a seeming winner. Military victory often increases the attractiveness of an ideology, and defeat reduces it. Think of how fascism's appeal plummeted after the defeat of Hitler and Mussolini, and communism's appeal increased after the Bolshevik triumph in the Russian Civil War and Stalin's successes in World War II. The American Revolution similarly g ave a boost to Enlightenment liberalism around the world. A British victory would have had the opposite effect. The impact would have been felt on both sides of the Atlantic.
5. The relatively better treatment of natives in Canada owed more to the lower number of settlers and the somewhat less desirable nature of the lands in question, than to any intrinsic superiority of British policy in that regard. The horrendous treatment of Australian aborigines underscores that the British could be just as brutal towards native populations as Americans often were. While I am no expert on this subject, recent historiography also paints a more negative picture of the nineteenth century Canadian government's treatment of Native Americans/First Nations. I  should emphasize that this critique of the British/Canadian record on forcible displacement of native peoples does not excuse what happened in the United States. The sad truth is that neither society has much to boast about when it comes to this issue.
6. Britain's generally benevolent treatment of Canada in the 19th century was in large part a product of lessons the British learned from the American Revolution (that oppression would be likely to lead to revolt). Moreover, they knew that a dissatisfied Canada was ripe for conquest by the US (which did in fact try to seize Canada twice).
7. It may actually be true that a parliamentary British North America would have a larger welfare/regulatory state than the US does. I see that as a negative, not a positive. Still, I can understand why many on the left take the opposite view. But it is also worth noting that Canada and the US actually score very close to each other on standard measures of economic liberty and government spending as a percentage of GDP (40.3% for Canada; just under 38% in the US ). In recent years, Canada sometimes scores a bit higher (in the sense of being slightly more free market). And while separation of powers is not the ideal regime for all nations, I think it is often superior to parliamentary government, for reasons I summarized here.
8. Points 1-5 above (along with other benefits of the Revolution I do not have time and space for here) strongly suggest that the good accomplished was worth the admittedly terrible loss of life.
I should also acknowledge Jeff Stein's 2015 response to Dylan Matthews on Vox, which makes a number of good points related to those above.
Some conservatives occasionally make the argument that the failure of the American Revolution would have forestalled the French Revolution and the resulting massive bloodshed of the Napoleonic wars. We can also take this further and suggest that preventing the French Revolution might have also blocked the later rise of revolutionary socialism and the horrific atrocities of communism. R obert Sobel's classic 1973 alternate history novel For Want of a Nail develops a scenario somewhat like this.
It is difficult to evaluate such wide-ranging claims. But it seems to me unlikely that the absence of the French Revolution would have prevented a war comparable to the Napoleonic Wars from arising. The period from 1688 to 1783 saw numerous bloody wars between Britain and France, including three that resulted in massive pan-European conflicts (the War of the Grand Alliance, the War of the Spanish Succession, and the Seven Years War). Given this history, it is highly likely another such conflict would have occurred even absent the French Revolution. It is notable that the Napoleonic Wars dragged on for many years even after France abandoned most of the ideological pretensions of the Revolution.
As for the rise of socialism and communism, it likely would have occurred anyway, as a byproduct of the Industrial Revolution and its associated intellectual and social changes. Indeed, a world with no American and French Revolutions might well have been one where socialism and reactionary conservatism and nationalism were the only major ideological alternatives of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But, admittedly, we cannot totally exclude the possibility of a world dominated by more moderate forms of conservatism emerging from this scenario. In that event, modern society would have fallen short of the heights of achievement reached by liberal democracy, but it might also have avoided the depths of communist and Nazi totalitarianism.
Since we are talking about a really big counterfactual, it is entirely possible that some low-probability event would have happened to upset one or more of my conjectures above. But, overall, I believe the evidence suggests that the American Revolution did a lot more good than harm.
The revolutionaries were far from perfect, and often failed to live up to their own principles. But their triumph nonetheless did much to advance the cause of freedom - not just in America, but around the world.
Some historians argue that counterfactual reasoning of this sort is worthless. How can we possibly evaluate events that didn't happen? It is hard enough to understand those that did. But, over the last several decades, scholars such as Niall Ferguson and Philip Tetlock have shown that careful counterfactual analysis can shed useful light on many aspects of the past. Among other things, the claim that Event X caused Event Y implies that Y would not have happened in the absence of X (or at least would not have happened on the same scale or to the same extent). To assess such causal claims, it is important to consider what might have transpired had X been prevented.
I consider the value of counterfactual history in greater detail in this article, which assesses a much more modest counterfactual scenario than the failure of the American Revolution.

The American Revolution was seen as a crucial event in the 18 th century as it was the first time where a colony that Britain controlled was able to successfully declare independence. Historians have been debating whether the Revolution was radical or whether it was conservative. Graham Wood writes in his book The Radicalism of the American Revolution the “we measure the radicalism by the amount of social change that actually took place- the transformations in the relationships that bound people to each other- then the American Revolution was not conservative at all… it was radical” [1] due to the fact that the American Revolution disputed existing social structures and then radically brought the idea of equality. However, the American Revolution could have been conservative because they wanted to preserve American rights and the property from the Government. This essay explores the political, social and economic aspects of whether the American Revolution was radical or conservative.

This paragraph explores whether the American Revolution bought radical political change or whether it was conservative. The declaration of Independence underlined many radical ideas whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government. In addition in 1818, John Adams wrote: “The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people; a change in their religious sentiments, of their duties and obligations”. [2] Murray N Rothbard sees the Declaration of Independence as a helpful source to get a clear insight into the revolution. Rothbard felt that if it took such significant period of abuses to persuade the mass of people to throw off their own commitments and to make revolution; then it cannot be possible for the revolution to be conservative. [3] It can be said that politicians may have had radical ideas as the things that the Declaration of Independence was proposing was escaping existing habits and wanting to eradicate anything to do with the British. However, it can be said that not all revolutionaries and politicians did not want complete radical political change. Even though Thomas Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence outlined radical ideas, Jefferson himself did not want complete change as it seen in his letter to Henry Lee in May 1825, “Not to find out new principles, or new arguments, never before thought of, not merely to say things which had never been said before” [4]. This demonstrates how Jefferson did not want completely different ideas that did not represent American culture and tradition which shows a sense of conservatism from Jefferson. Also, the revolution was all about protecting and conserving the American colonist’s rights as they wanted to prevent social mobility so they can be the ones running America when the revolution was over.  To add to this after the revolution, even though Britain’s influence in colonies had not completely disappeared, Congress had control of politics in the colonies which is what the American leaders wanted to protect. Taking all of the factors into consideration, in terms of the revolution was conservative in bringing political change as leaders wanted to preserve their own rights so they could lead the country when the revolution ended. However, there were some radical aspects as leaders would use radical quotes such as “All men are created equal” [5], which was said in the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, to get their ideas across.
It can be said the American Revolution was radical as it transformed American society into a society with revolutionary and radical thought ready to rise against the abuses of the British. However, there is an argument that the revolution was conservative in a bid to preserve the rights of the Americans. During the Revolution, the revolutionaries used tactics such as revolutionary songs to bring revolutionary spirit among the American people and inspired the people in America to rise up for change as the song mentions, “sprightly youths attend, Leave their sweethearts and risk their lives, Their country to defend.” [6] This shows the revolutionary attitude that was being instilled in American society to a point where they had to leave the people that were most important to them and fight for their rights which demonstrates if the American people were inspired by this song then radical revolution was more important to them than their own relatives. John Franklin Jameson argues due to the American Revolution, “The relations of social classes to each other, the institution of slavery, the system of land-holding… the forms and spirit of the intellectual and religious life all felt the transforming hand of the revolution”. [7] Gordon Wood argues that how society “radically and thoroughly transformed” and turned into one “unlike any that had ever existed anywhere in the world,” shows the social outcomes of the American Revolution were far more dramatic than what was imagined. For example, religion changed during the American Revolution as now it was used as a moral sanction to oppose the British as to the American people, the revolution was justified by God whereas before Religion was ignored and there was more of an emphasis on religious freedom. However, not everyone in America wanted to fight a radical revolution and have radical change The planter-merchant class who were the main class leading the revolution did not experience poverty or British oppression and they were not aiming to promote social mobility and they did not want to remove artificial privilege. The merchant class had different aims to the rest of American society as they wanted to prevent Britain from enforcing their rights on American culture and tradition. This shows rather the Revolution taking a radical approach it was more a defensive movement in order to keep the liberties that the Americans enjoyed. Taking the aspects into consideration, it can be said that the American Revolution was radical in bringing about social change as the way American’s would live their lives would never be the same as they now had a revolutionary spirit which made them be viewed differently around the world. However, it can also be said that the merchant class attitudes going into the revolution that they wanted to preserve American tradition and culture suggests that there was not entirely a radical social change.
This paragraph examines whether the American Revolution bought radical economic change or whether it was conservative. Before the initial American Revolution, there were signs of radicalism as when the American people felt threatened they were willing to risk their economic well-being for the sake of liberty. This is seen through the Boston Tea Party where America felt economically threatened by the Tea Act in 1773 so they protested by dumping 342 chests of British tea into the river. Wood argues the Revolution brought radical change in the economy as the revolution, “released powerful entrepreneurial and commercial energies that few realize existed and transformed the economic landscape of the country” [8] This is evident as before the American Revolution there were heavy restrictions on tea, paper and other resources that were introduced by Britain which was Britain’s attempt to increase revenue. However, after the Revolution, the trade restrictions that had previously limited American trade were canceled as Britain’s presence in America was no more which also meant the trade economy in America between the colonies was very successful. Similar to Wood’s view, Clarence L. Ver Steeg also sees Trade as being, “never the same as the result of the Revolution” [9]. In his Journal he continues to argue that the opening up of China for trade was due to the revolution as when Britain was in control of America, that was as an unattainable dream to the Americans. The fact that American colonist had achieved this “unattainable dream” shows there was a radical change in economic life after the Revolution.  Also, manufacturing industries continued to expand, particularly in consumer products and military weapons which would strengthen their military defense. This shows the radical change in the economy as the course of trade completely changed leading to American colonist not feeling limited by Britain. However the fact that the elite class wanted to protect their land and their property even though leaders constantly said “All men are created equal” [10] shows the aims of the revolution was to conserve their land and prevent the lower class from attaining it.
To conclude, the American Revolution was radical to a certain extent as it did not bring a complete change in every aspect of America. In terms of political change, the main aim was to preserve their own traditions and customs and also to stop social mobility from happening to show it was conservative. However, the radical tactics that were used by leaders such as Thomas Jefferson definitely show that there radical aspects in ensuring change. The American Revolution radically transformed American society as social functions in society such as Religion and Education was to change forever as now America were seen as more liberated. In contrast to this, the merchant class still wanted to protect their own traditions that were there before the revolution.  The American Revolution definitely transformed the economy as the trade was completely modified as there were no more restrictions which greatly benefitted America.

The American Revolution: Was it Justified?   

The American Revolution was a battle that began in 1776 and ended in 1781. The main cause for the war was because the American colonists wanted to separate from Britain. There were many reasons as to why they thought this including the belief that Britain needed the colonists consent to tax them. The question is however, were the Patriots actions justified? Did they have the right to oppose their kings rulings such as taxation and expansion west in sacrificially violent manners?	
Patriots were violent in the fact that they tortured and killed innocent British officers and loyalists. They were not a tolerant group, and Loyalists suffered regular harassment and were subject to personal attacks. There are numerous reports of personal attacks executed by the patriots in the act of tarring and feathering individuals. They stripped those of their clothes, covered them in tar and feathers and were forced to parade about in the public. Although this was only meant to publicly humiliate the victim, it did also cause intense burns and blisters on their skin and was very difficult to remove without tearing skin. One of the most brutal attacks was on the loyalist, John Malcolm who was stripped, tarred and beaten with switches and horse whips in the frigid winter air for over four hours. It was recorded that the tarr had peeled of large slivers of his skin. His recovery from the frostbite and blisters from the tarr took a lengthy eight

restricted of natural rights. In such case, during the American Revolution, colonies had the right to get rid of their government because the king was not rightly protecting the citizens rights. Not only that, but direct taxes were enforced upon the citizens leading to acts being passed in opposition to the rebellion. All things considered, I would say that the American Revolution was justified under the Declaration of Independence.

Was The American Revolution Justified
There is a debate that has gone on for decades and is still without a definitive answer. That burning question is as follows: were the original Patriots justified in their cause for revolution? The obvious answer is yes, the Patriot cause for revolution was justified. This is for multiple reasons but there are three big ones. The first is that the 13 colonies were taxed very unfairly. This is because they had no one in parliament to represent them, so when they were taxed, they had no voice in it
Was The American Revolution Justified Analysis
The American Revolution was not justified due to the validity of the reasoning behind Britain’s taxation of the colonies and hinderance of westward expansion and consequently conveys the fallaciousness of the idea that the Britain’s cruel enforcement of these laws gave grounds for a rebellion. Britain only taxed the colonies because of the massive debt they incurred in the Seven Years war or the French and Indian war. Moreover, one of the main motives for this war was to protect the colonies from

Was The American Revolution Justified Essay
The American Revolution was justified because the colonists were not being treaty fairy and equally by the British. And according to Jefferson, “people being oppressed have a moral obligation to rebel against their oppressors”. From the beginning, the colonists were not given the full rights as British men, just because they were not living in that country. The Navigation Acts passed by the Parliament to restrict colonial trade, and all of colonial trade with Europe had to go through England, overall
The American Revolution Was NOT Justified Essay

Causes Of The American Revolution
The American Revolution was one of the greatest political and ideological revolution in history, starting with a slow spread of the flames of rage against the British through the hearts of the angry American colonists. As tensions started to rise between them, the battle between mother and child became inevitable. There was going to be bloodshed and fighting, and LOTS of it. Starting with the French and Indian War (or the Seven Years War) from 1756 to 1763, the colonists were angry at being prohibited

Background, History, And The Beginning Of The Revolution
The thirteen colonies that became the USA were originally
colonies of Great Britain.  By the time the American Revolution
took place, the citizens of these colonies were beginning
to get tired of the British rule.  Rebellion and discontent
were rampant.  For those people who see the change in the
American government and society a real Revolution, the
Revolution is essentially an economic one.  The main reason the
colonies started rebelling against 'mother England' was the
taxation issue.  The colonies debated England's legal power to
tax them and, furthermore, did not wish to be taxed without
representation.  This was one of the main causes of the
Revolutionary War.  The Revenue Act of 1764 made the
constitutional issue of whether or not the King had the right to tax the
thirteen colonies an issue, and this eventually "became an
entering wedge in the great dispute that was finally to wrest
the American colonies from England" (Olsen, 6).  It was the
phrase 'taxation without representation' "that was to draw
many to the cause of the American patriots against the mother
country" (6).
The reaction against taxation was often violent and the
most powerful and articulate groups in the population rose
against the taxation (6). "Resolutions denouncing taxation
without representation as a threat to colonial liberties" were
passed (6).  In October of 1765, colonial representatives met
on their own initiative for the first time and decided to
"mobilize colonial opinion against parliamentary interference
in American affairs" (6).  From this point on, events began to
reach the point of no return for the colonies.    In
December 1773, the

Boston Tea Party occurred as a reaction to the
hated Tea Act of earlier that year.  In 1774, the
First
Continental Congress met and formed an 'Association,' which ended
up assuming leadership and spurred new local organizations to
end royal authority (Olsen, 9).  Because of the influence of
these Associations, many people joined the movement, and
collection of supplies and mobilization of troops began to
take place.  The leadership of the Association was able to fan "public opinion into revolutionary ardor" (9).
However, not everyone favored the revolutionary movement;
this was especially true in areas of mixed ethnic cultures and
in those that were untouched by the war.  The citizens of the
middle colonies were especially unenthusiastic about the
revolution (Ward, 78).  Among those who did support a change
in the government structure, not everyone who joined the
movement favored violence.   Quakers and members of other
religions, as well as many merchants from the middle colonies,
and some discontented farmers and frontiersmen from southern
colonies opposed the use of violence, and instead favored "discussion and compromise as the proper solution" (Olsen, 9).
The patriots were able to gain a great deal of support for a
violent Revolution from the less well-to-do, from many of the
professional class, especially lawyers, some of the great
planters and a number of merchants (9).  Support for the
Revolution increased when it became clear that King "George
III had no intention of making concessions" (9).  By the Fall
of 1774, the American people "had in place the mechanisms of
revolutionary organization on the local and colony level.  A
Congress of the colonies would coordinate and control the
revolutionary movement" (Ward, 53).    The Revolutionary War erupted on April 19, 1775 (60).
The reason the British and the Americans resorted to using
arms after a decade of fighting verbally and ideologically
over the rights of the British subjects in the colonies, was
because both sides had finally "become convinced that force
alone could decide the issues that divided the empire" ( Miller, 167).  In April 1775, the
 battle of Lexington occurred,
closely followed by the battle of Concord.  The shot at
Lexington marked the first blood spilled in the war of the
American independence (Ward, 3). "The American Revolution now
had its martyrs" (409).  These two very important instances of
bloodshed served to evoke the spirit of American patriotism
all over the colonies (Olsen, 10).  The Second Continental
Congress met on May 10, 1775 and George Washington was elected
commander of the patriotic forces.  He and his army fought for
the defense of American liberty and consequently led America
to independence (Ward, 61-62).  The British rejection of the
Olive Branch Petition, which expressed a "general desire for
the restoration of harmony between Britain and her colonies" ( Thomas, 248), issued in the summer of 1775, "stiffened the
patriots' resolve towards independence" (BMPL, 41).  Another
strong arguments for independence revolved around the issue of
not becoming like the rotten Mother England.  Americans
believed that "the longer they remained within the British Empire,
the greater was the danger of contamination" (Miller, 427).   By early 1776, Americans were ready to denounce any
allegiance to the British crown (Ward, 63).  In January of
that same year, Thomas Paine published Common Sense, a
brochure that strongly served to rally Americans to independence.
Paine's writing convinced many of his countrymen to disown the
monarchy and replace it with a republic (76-77). "As long as
Americans deluded themselves with the hope that they could be
free and yet remain British subjects, Paine believed that the
cause of liberty was doomed" (Miller, 463).  By this time, the
movement toward revolution was rapidly gaining speed.  By
spring of that same year, all royal governors had been ousted
and patriots replaced British authority in the colonies by
makeshift governments.  The Congress itself exercised
sovereign powers (Ward, 79).  In July 1776, Congress met and adop-
ted the Declaration of Independence from Britain.

The Articles of Confederation was the first document uniting the
citizens of all thirteen colonies into one country.  Under the
Articles, the central government was very weak and the states
held most power, but it was a beginning.  As a result of
Shay's Rebellion, the Articles were disowned and the 
Federal Constitution was written in 1787.  It is still the basic law
of the United States of America.
Summary.
Many revolutions begin with the outbreak of violence,
which is often a response to heightened repression or other
extraordinary demands from government against their people.
The American Revolution is an obvious example of this (Rule ,
160).  The violence took the form of the Revolutionary War and
Congress became the leadership.  American Revolution was the
first anti-colonial, democratic revolution in history.
Americans insisted on representation and when the British denied
it, they fought their colonizers.  Americans won and set up
their own government, a republic.  Thus, what was
initially undertaken to secure for British Americans
guarantees of local autonomy and individual rights equivalent
to those enjoyed by Englishmen in the home islands,
...quickly became in 1775-76 a struggle for political independence (Greene, 1).
Much of the revolutionary cause came from the "colonial
challenge to Parliament's power of legislation... " (Thomas,
333).  This was the beginning of the Revolution.  Since the
patriots' demands could not be met, the country proclaimed
itself independent from 'mother England' and the United States
of America were born.

So, these sources present arguments against the American Revolution being revolutionary. They suggest that the revolution wasn't as radical as it's often portrayed and that it might have even set back certain causes, such as the abolition of slavery. Some argue that the revolution was more about preserving the status quo for the elite rather than bringing about widespread social change.

Let me summarize the main points made by critics of the revolution's revolutionary nature:

1. Slavery: Critics argue that the revolution didn't lead to the immediate abolition of slavery and, in fact, might have delayed it. They point out that Britain abolished slavery in 1833, thirty years before the United States, and without a civil war.

2. Treatment of Native Americans: Some contend that Native Americans were treated better under British rule and that the revolution led to worse treatment of indigenous peoples.

3. Form of Government: Left-leaning critics sometimes argue that a parliamentary system, as in Britain, would have led to a larger welfare and regulatory state, which they see as preferable to the American system of separation of powers.

4. Gradual Change: Some suggest that the British Empire could have granted increased autonomy to the colonies gradually, without the need for a violent revolution.

5. Cost in Lives: The critics point out the human cost of the revolution, with thousands of deaths, and question whether the benefits justified such losses.

Now, I need to evaluate these arguments. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, regarding slavery: It's true that slavery persisted in the United States until the Civil War, while Britain abolished it earlier. However, it's important to consider the context. The American Revolution occurred in 1776, and the British abolition came in 1833. In the interim, the ideas of liberty and equality spread during the revolution, which planted seeds for future abolitionist movements in both the U.S. and Britain. Moreover, some Northern states began to abolish slavery shortly after the revolution, and the importation of slaves was banned in 1808. So, while the revolution didn't end slavery immediately, it set in motion a series of events that eventually led to its abolition.

Second, the treatment of Native Americans: This is a complex issue. While it's true that Native Americans faced harsh treatment under both British and American rule, it's not entirely accurate to say that British rule was significantly better. The British often used Native Americans as allies against the colonists during the revolution, which led to further conflict and suffering for indigenous peoples. Post-revolution, American expansion indeed led to more displacement and violence against Native Americans, but it's debatable whether British rule would have been markedly better in this regard.

Third, the form of government: Some argue that a parliamentary system would have been superior to the American system of separation of powers. This is a matter of political philosophy and preference. The American system was designed to prevent the concentration of power and protect individual liberties, which aligns with Enlightenment ideals. While a parliamentary system might lead to a stronger welfare state, it's not necessarily the case that this would be an improvement for everyone. Moreover, the American system has its own strengths, such as checks and balances, which have helped maintain stability and prevent tyranny.

Fourth, the idea that Britain could have granted increased autonomy gradually: This is speculative, but history suggests that without the revolution, Britain might not have been inclined to grant more autonomy to the colonies. The revolution forced Britain to recognize the colonies' desire for self-governance, and subsequent British policies towards other colonies, like Canada and Australia, were indeed more lenient. However, it's unclear whether this would have happened without the revolution.

Finally, the human cost: The loss of life in the revolution was indeed significant, and any war has its horrors. However, the alternative—remaining under British rule—would have likely meant continued suppression of colonial aspirations for self-governance and could have stifled the development of democratic ideals. The revolution inspired other movements around the world and helped spread the concept of popular sovereignty.

In conclusion, while there are valid points to be made about the limitations and costs of the American Revolution, I believe that overall, it was a revolutionary event that brought about significant and positive changes. It established a new form of government based on democratic principles, inspired other movements for liberty and equality, and set the stage for the eventual abolition of slavery and expansion of rights to more segments of society.

I should also consider that some critics see the revolution as unnecessary or counterproductive, but I think that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs and that the revolution was a necessary step in the development of the United States as a sovereign and democratic nation.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{The American Revolution was revolutionary because it brought about significant political, social, and economic changes that transformed the thirteen colonies into an independent nation based on democratic principles, inspired other movements for liberty and equality, and set the stage for future advancements in human rights.}} \]
