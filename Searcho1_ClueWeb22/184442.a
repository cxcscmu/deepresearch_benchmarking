So I'm trying to figure out why we need laws to govern organ transplantation. At first glance, it seems like a pretty straightforward process: people donate organs, and others in need receive them. But I'm sure there's more to it, which is why regulations are necessary. Let me think about this step by step.

First off, what exactly is organ transplantation? It's the surgical procedure of transferring an organ from one person to another. The person receiving the organ is called the recipient, and the person providing the organ is the donor. Donors can be living or deceased, and not all organs can be donated while the donor is alive, like the heart or pancreas.

Now, why do we need laws for this? Probably to handle a bunch of complex issues that can arise in the process. Let me list some potential reasons:

1. **Ensuring Consent:** Making sure that donors willingly agree to donate their organs without coercion or misunderstanding.

2. **Determining Eligibility:** Deciding who gets an organ based on medical need, compatibility, and other factors.

3. **Preventing Exploitation:** Avoiding situations where people are forced to donate organs for money or other incentives.

4. **Maintaining Ethical Standards:** Ensuring that the entire process is fair, transparent, and ethical.

5. **Addressing Cultural and Religious Beliefs:** Respecting different cultures' and religions' views on organ donation.

6. **Regulating Transplantation Procedures:** Ensuring that the medical procedures are safe and effective.

7. **Handling Organ Distribution:** Deciding how organs are allocated across regions and among potential recipients.

8. **Protecting Donors and Recipients:** Ensuring the health and safety of both parties involved.

These seem like important aspects that need to be regulated to make sure everything runs smoothly and ethically. But I should probably look into this more deeply to understand the specific challenges and how laws address them.

Maybe I should look up some examples of organ transplantation laws in different countries to see what they cover. For instance, in the United States, there's the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which plays a significant role in governing organ transplantation. Let me see what that entails.

The National Organ Transplant Act
In 1984, the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) began to provide a comprehensive structure and articulated policy regarding organ transplantation. This legislation reflected Congress’s acknowledgement of the advances being made in transplantation technology and procedures. For example, there was now an 80 percent survival rate for those undergoing kidney transplants. And the drug cyclo-sporin had increased the survival rate of liver transplant patients from 35 to 70 percent for the first year after undergoing a liver transplant. Of course, there was still great concern about the shortage of available organs.
NOTA also provided funds for grants for qualified organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The OPTN was intended to assist OPOs in distributing organs that could not be used in the OPO’s geographical area. The Act provided grant money for planning, establishing, and operating or expanding organ procurement organizations. To qualify for the grant money, the OPO had to show that it was a nonprofit organization qualified to receive Medicare reimbursement for kidney procurement. It also had to describe established procedures to obtain payment for organs (other than kidneys) that were provided to transplant centers. The Act expressly forbade selling human organs across state lines. Apparently, the committee responsible for this provision felt strongly that human body parts should not be viewed as commodities.
One of the most important achievements of the Act was the establishment of a 25-member Task Force on Organ Transplantation. This task force studies human transplant policy issues, including organ procurement and distribution. The Task Force published its first report covering medical, legal, social, ethical, and economic issues related to organ procurement and transplantation in 1986. In this report, the Task Force commented on the relatively small percentage of transplantable organs that were actually harvested for transplantation and the need to increase this supply. It urged the continued development of organ transplant policies that encourage individuals to donate organs.

On October 19, 1984, the Congress of the United States approved the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA). It not only established the framework for the U.S. organ transplant system but has served as a model for the development of other transplant networks worldwide.
Through the establishment of a national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the law directed that organ allocation would be managed on a national basis and be developed through a unique public-private partnership. Since the initial network contract was finalized in 1986, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has served as the OPTN under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
OPTN policies are developed by a broad community that includes donation and transplant clinicians and professionals, as well as people personally touched by the donation and transplant experience. NOTA and subsequent federal regulation call on the OPTN to emphasize fair and equitable patient access to transplantation, as well as reliance on objective medical evidence and adaptability to rapid evolution in clinical treatment and scientific understanding.
Many of the OPTN’s responsibilities, priorities and policies have changed over the years. Yet the lifesaving gift of organ donation, and the continuing need of candidates awaiting a transplant, remain the same today as they did 30 years ago. To fulfill the ultimate goals of NOTA, we must continue to ensure that the national transplant network allocates organs efficiently and fairly. We must also build public knowledge and trust in organ donation to help increase transplant opportunities for everyone in need.

History[edit]
Before NOTA was put in place, there was no clear jurisdiction on what property rights were for a human corpse. It was so apparent you just can't! You just can't... Instead, America applied a "quasi-right" to a corpse. This meant that the relatives of a deceased person had a possessory right long enough to decide how to bury or dispose of the corpse. This does not mean a property right which means they do not have a right to transfer, devise, possess, and lease the human organs and tissues. [1]
Due to a shortage in organs but a growing demand for transplantations, people began to use other means to purchase organs outside of a hospital setting. The organ market began to become a commercial market. H. Barry Jacobs, the head of a Virginia company, announced in 1983 a new plan to buy and sell human organs on the market. This plan put healthy human kidneys in the price range of up to $10,000 plus a $2,000 to $5,000 commission fee for Jacobs. [2] This brought the issue out into the open. NOTA was a response to this proposal making it criminal to transfer human organs for valuable consideration for the purposes of human transplantation. [3]
At the time NOTA was passed, there was an 80% survival rate for kidney transplants. A new drug, cyclosporin, had also increased the survival rate of liver transplant patients from 35% to 70% in a patient's first year of undergoing a liver transplant. This made it clear that legislation was aware of a growing need and growing organ shortage when NOTA was passed. [4]
NOTA made it illegal to compensate organ donors but did not prevent payment for other forms of donations (such as human plasma, sperm, and egg cells). Although bone marrow is not an organ or a component of an organ, the act made paying bone marrow donors illegal. At the time the act was passed, donating bone marrow involved a painful and risky medical procedure. [5] In the years after the act was passed, a new procedure (apheresis) made it possible to harvest bone marrow cells through a non-surgical procedure similar to blood donation. In 2009, a public interest law firm (The Institute for Justice) sued to allow donors to be compensated for giving bone marrow. [6] The firm argued that the development of apheresis meant that donors who gave bone marrow through blood donation should be allowed to receive compensation. [5] The organization predicted that allowing compensation would increase the pool of available donors, and claimed that 3,000 Americans die each year while waiting for compatible marrow donors. [5] [7] Critics argued that allowing compensation could reduce donation, increase the risk of disease, and lead to the exploitation of the poor. [5] [6] [8] In December 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that donors giving bone marrow via apheresis were eligible for compensation. [5] In November 2013, the federal government proposed a regulation that would change legal definitions to cover bone marrow regardless of how it is obtained. This would have the effect of keeping the ban on compensating donors in place. As of July 2014, the proposal was still under review. [9]
Sections of NOTA[edit]
Title I - Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation[edit]
Title I states the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation to regulate how deceased donor organs are handled and who receives transplantations and the process one must go through in regards to a deceased donor organ transplantation along with other lines of duty. This Task Force is composed of 25 members.
Duties of the Task Force include:
handling all medical, legal, ethical, economic, and social issues that may rise from obtaining deceased human organs and the transplantation of them.
assessing immunosuppressive medication used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients, including safety, effectiveness, costs, insurance reimbursements, and making sure those who need these drugs can receive them
prepare a report including assessments of public and private efforts to obtain deceased human organs, problems in obtaining these organs, recommendations for education and training of health professionals and for education of the general public
assessment of the effectiveness and of establishing a national registry of deceased human organ donors
A full list can be found in Sec. 101 (3) in Pub.L. 98–507.[10]
Title II - Organ Procurement Activities[edit]
Title II established the Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) for deceased organ transplants. These OPO's are designed to increase the number of registered deceased organ donors and when those donors become available, they coordinate the donation process from donor to patient. [11]
NOTA also established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), a membership organization transplant-related individuals and organizations, primarily transplant centers. OPTN is currently administered by the private, non-profit organization, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in Richmond, Virginia. OPTN operates under the authority of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Robert Walsh is the current Project Officer for OPTN. [12]
Their duties include:
"facilitating the deceased organ matching and placement process through the use of the computer system and a fully staffed Organ Center operating 24 hours a day"
"developing consensus based policies and procedures for deceased organ recovery, distribution (allocation), and transportation"
"collecting and managing scientific data about organ donation and transplantation"
"providing data to the government, the public, students, researchers, and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for use in the ongoing quest for improvement in the field of solid organ allocation and transplantation"
"developing and maintaining a secure Web-based computer system, which maintains the nation's deceased organ transplant waiting list and recipient/donor organ characteristics"; and,
"providing professional and public education about donation and transplantation, the activities of the OPTN and the critical need for donation."
The Act also introduced a scientific Federal Registry of all the recipients of organ transplants. This registry includes patient information and transplant procedures. [13]
Title III - Prohibition of Organ Purchases[edit]
NOTA specifically states "it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce."  The penalty of breaking this law is a fine of $50,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. [14]
Title IV - Miscellaneous[edit]
NOTA created a "national registry of voluntary bone marrow donors."  Donors on this list have given informed consent and their names are kept confidential. This registry is upheld by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. [15]
Amendments[edit]
1988[edit]
The 1988 Amendment of NOTA introduced the Organ Procurement Organizations and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network explained in detail in Title II of NOTA. [16]
1990[edit]
The 1990 Amendment of NOTA introduced the Federal Registry.
Ethics[edit]
Some believe that if organ transplantation is a commercial process, incentives for the disfranchised and poor would be created to manipulate them into being more willing to donate. To these detractors, putting a purchase price on a body part resembles slavery and treats a class of people as subhuman. Also, the buying and selling of organs for transplantation as a business arrangement has the potential to lead to misrepresentation of a donor’s medical information, especially if they were in poor financial shape. [17]

Alright, from these search results, I can see that the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) was passed in 1984 and it plays a crucial role in governing organ transplantation in the United States. It seems like it addresses several key aspects, such as establishing organ procurement organizations, creating a national organ sharing network, and prohibiting the sale of human organs.

Let me try to summarize what I've gathered so far:

- NOTA established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and the Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) to manage and increase organ donation and transplantation.

- It set up a system for organ allocation and sharing across the country.

- It prohibits the sale of human organs, making it illegal to buy or sell organs for transplantation.

- It also established a task force to study and recommend policies related to organ transplantation.

But why was this act necessary? What problems was it trying to solve?

Looking back at the history, before NOTA, there was confusion and inconsistency in how organs were procured and distributed. There was a growing need for transplants due to medical advancements, but also a shortage of organs. Additionally, there were concerns about exploitation and unethical practices, such as people selling their organs for profit.

So, NOTA was enacted to create a regulated, ethical system for organ transplantation. It aimed to ensure that organs are distributed fairly based on medical need rather than wealth or social status. By prohibiting the sale of organs, it helps prevent exploitation, especially of vulnerable populations who might feel pressured to sell their organs for money.

Moreover, NOTA likely helps standardize practices across the country, ensuring that all transplant centers and OPOs follow the same rules and guidelines, which is crucial for the safety and success of transplants.

I should also consider international perspectives. Different countries have different approaches to organ transplantation, and some face unique challenges. For example, in China, there have been controversies around organ sourcing, with allegations of organs being harvested from prisoners without consent. In contrast, countries like Spain and Croatia have high organ donation rates due to effective national programs and public awareness.

Perhaps looking into how other countries regulate organ transplantation could provide more insight into why laws are necessary.

Abstract/Description:
Organ transplantation saves lives. Once considered a last resort for critically ill patients, it is now a practical treatment for freeing kidney patients from dialysis machines and giving patients dying from heart, liver, lung and pancreatic disease a second chance for life. Unfortunately, the number of human organs available for transplant has never been sufficient to meet the need. Many transplant candidates die waiting for an organ that does not come. This research looks
         at the challenge of securing human organs for transplantation by examining the laws that have been enacted to attempt to alleviate this shortage.
Part I of this thesis is a review of the laws governing organ donation in the United States beginning with a historical review of early English Law moving on to Twentieth Century Law, including developing case law as well as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA). Part II examines the 2006 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act more closely. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia had adopted this model law by 2008. A quantitative analysis using a two-tailed, paired t-test
         compared the number of organ transplants for these Early Adopting States at the base year of 2006 and at 2012 to see if these states experienced an increase in transplants that may be attributable to the law. The 14 Late-Adopting States and the four Non-Adopting States were analyzed in the same manner.
The results revealed that the Early Adopting States experienced no statistically significant difference in the number of organ transplants between 2006-2012. This suggests that the 2006 UAGA has not achieved its goal of increasing the number of organ transplants. A brief discussion of reasons why this may be the case follows. This thesis also offers suggestions of other methods of organ procurement that should be considered, including those that would more fundamentally
         change the U.S. system of voluntary donation.

Organ Transplantation Law In India
The transplantation of an organ from one body to another is known as the 
      organ transplant. The person who gives the organ is called the donor while 
      the one who receives is called the recipient. Organ transplant is done to 
      replace the recipient's damaged organ with the working organ of the donor 
      so that the recipient could function normally.
Organ Transplantation is a boon to medical industry as it has helped in 
      saving the lives of those who would have died otherwise. There is a great 
      need for human organs for transplantation. In fact, the need far exceeds 
      the supply of transplantable organs. This disparity has led to the 
      formulation of various legislations, attempting to regulate the scare 
      resources (transplantable human organs) and to help establish an equitable 
      system to allocate the organs where they can do the most good.
Legally, organ donation can take place from living, genetically-related 
      individuals; from living, unrelated individuals in special circumstances 
      where no unauthorized payment is made to the donor; or from cadavers. Live 
      donation of a single kidney was the first done in 1954, but live donation 
      of parts of other organs is a relatively recent innovation in the 1990s.
To date the major source of organs and tissues in the West has been from 
      cadaveric donors. Living tissue deteriorates rapidly when it loses its 
      blood supply, and organs need to be cooled and transported for 
      implantation into the recipient within a limited number of hours. Short 
      transfer time, entailing removal of organs from beating heart' donors, 
      was made possible by the acceptance of brain stem death' as death.
Worldwide, the demand for organs is growing, as the supply of organs and 
      tissues for transplantation has not kept pace with demand. In the UK only 
      approximately 900 individuals become organ donors each year, while over 
      6000 people are waiting for suitable organs. In the US much the same 
      situation exists, with 70 000 presently on the waiting list and only 
      approximately 5500 cadaveric donors per year.
There are several reasons for the shortage of organs. Perhaps the most 
      common reason is that people are hesitant to donate organs. There are 
      other reasons as well: for example, physicians may neglect to inquire of 
      family members whether they would consent to donating organs when their 
      loved one dies. In other cases, the deceased's wishes to donate his or her 
      organs may not be known by those in the position to act on those wishes.
Presently three major legal frameworks govern the donation of organs 
      worldwide. The UK, along with a number of European countries, e.g. Germany 
      and Italy, and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have opting-in' 
      systems. This means that the person in lawful possession of the body may 
      authorize the removal of organs and tissues. In practice donation is 
      usually requested from the next-of-kin of the deceased. Many other 
      countries, including e.g. Austria, Belgium, and Singapore, have introduced 
      opt-out' or presumed consent' systems that assume individuals have 
      granted permission for their organs to be donated, unless they specify 
      otherwise, in advance of their death. Required request' or routine 
      enquiry of the next-of-kin of a potential donor, forms part of state law 
      in the US. It provides for hospitals that fail to adopt required request' 
      polices to be denied support from healthcare funding agencies.
WHO has now approved organ transplantation as a well established therapy.
A Harvard Medical School committee made a historic proposal in 1968, 
      recommending the criteria of death based on brain activity. In 1976 the 
      Royal College of the UK published a comprehensive code for determination 
      of 'Brain Death'. Now most countries, including India in 1994, redefine 
      death as cessation of brain stem activity and organs can legally be 
      removed after brain death.
In a bid to understand various organ donation policies prevailing in other 
      countries of the world a team of experts headed by R.K.Srivastava, the 
      Director General of Health Services made a visit to all the major 
      countries and noted that most of the countries have adopted the presumed 
      consent method, where the person who is brain dead is considered to have 
      agreed to donate the organs. In other cases, family of the donor holds the 
      right to give the consent.
To attempt to overcome the uncontrollable trade in organs the Indian 
      parliament passed a bill in 1994, in keeping with the WHO guiding 
      principles, prohibiting commercial dealings. There are restrictions for 
      removal and retrieval of human organs and also regulations of hospitals 
      involved to ensure transparency by all concerned. The aim of the 
      Transplantation of Human Organs Act is to provide for the regulation of 
      removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic 
      purposes and for the prevention of commercial dealings in human organs.
The passing of Transplantation of Human Organ Act heralded a new era in 
      Indian medicine. This legislation was written on similar likes as the UK 
      Transplant Act. The essence of this legislation was threefold:
1. To accept brain death as also a definition of death.
2. To stop commercial dealing in organs
3. To define the first relative (father, mother, brother, sister, son, 
      daughter and wife) who could donate organs without permission from the 
      government.
Organ transplant law does not allow exchange of money between the donor 
      and the recipient. According to the Act, the unrelated donor has to file 
      an affidavit in the court of a magistrate stating that the organ is being 
      donated out of affection. After which the donor has to undergo number of 
      tests before the actual transplant takes place. The Authorization 
      Committee set up for the purpose ensures that all the documents required 
      under the act have been supplied. If it is found that the money has been 
      exchanged in the process then both the recipient as well as the donor are 
      considered as prime offenders under the law.
According to the Indian law, organ sales are banned and therefore no 
      foreigner can get a local donor. Human organ transplant laws are very 
      strict in India and the penalty incurred for organ trade is also very 
      high.
THOA limits live transplants to three categories:
relatives by blood, 
      spouses, and those who donated out of affection. State authorisation 
      committees are meant to scrutinize all applications for unrelated 
      transplants. Hospitals conducting transplants are supposed to be 
      registered with committees which are also supposed to monitor their 
      functioning.
However, the practice of medicine is largely unregulated here and there 
      are numerous problems regarding proper implementation of the program. 
      Medical councils and organizations have played a passive role on ethical 
      issues. They have failed to make their stand public or take action even in 
      obvious malpractice.
Although the press has been publishing explicit details on rackets in 
      kidney transplantation in various cities no medical body has thought it 
      fit to even conduct an investigation into them.
State medical councils have suo moto powers of investigation. These have 
      never been invoked. The councils have also turned a blind eye to 
      complaints lodged with them.
For instance, the Karnataka Medical Council, admitted that complaints 
      against the accused in the Bangalore scam in 1993. All that the council 
      had done was to note' that the behaviour of the doctors who appeared 
      before them was suspicious'. With a population that is largely illiterate 
      and gullible, such attitudes by disciplinary agencies have nurtured a 
      fertile ground for racketeering.
Also, the diagnosis of brain death is made in ICUs where facilities exist 
      for sustaining the other organ systems of a brain dead patient. Such ICUs 
      are few and are commonly located in big metropolitan hospitals. They are 
      overburdened, understaffed and lack a central command structure. Brain 
      dead patients have traditionally been given low priority in ICUs and 
      treated with benign neglect.
When such patients become donors, they require the same attention as that 
      given to any critically ill patient. This demands a major attitudinal 
      change and could be resented by an already overburdened staff.
The act of obtaining consent is also a hindrance towards successful 
      running of the program. The relatives of the patient are not very 
      forthcoming, and the doctors not motivated enough. Patients may lack 
      relatives or may not have them in attendance when the diagnosis of brain 
      death is made.
In a country where monetary and political considerations are acquiring an 
      ominous hold on the behaviour of the medical profession, the scope for 
      unethical acts in the transplant process is fearsome. In a private sector, 
      where market values and profit making have reached grotesque levels, there 
      could be havoc in a field where cash benefits can be astronomical.
The overall health allocation in our budget is one of the lowest in 
      developing countries. There is scope for an increase in health funding. 
      Resources for advanced medicine need not be provided at the cost of 
      primary care if the state ensures a proper balance. Thousands with 
      endstage disease can be provided a new lease of life through cadaveric 
      transplant programs. Hitherto, only the very rich benefited from 
      transplantation- of organs by travelling abroad and spending large sums. 
      We should make organ transplants affordable by the average citizen in our 
      public institutions.
In various surveys conducted, it has been seen that 72% of the population 
      were willing to donate eyes, but less than 50% were willing to consider 
      solid organ donation. 74% of Hindus, 72% Christians, 58% Muslims were 
      willing to consider organ donation; however the concept of brain death was 
      new to most of the people surveyed. An audit of 159 brain death patients 
      showed that 30 or 19% of the relatives donated of the organs of their 
      loved ones.
In the last 6 years 35 hospitals in the country from various regions have 
      undertaken cadaver transplants. Chennai has done the maximum number of 
      cadaver transplants in the country. However most of them lacked motivated 
      medical or social workers who could be trained to speak to the relatives 
      in brain death situations. In event of the donor not being a first 
      relative an approval had to be obtained by a government appointed 
      authorization committee in each state of the country.
The public attitude survey indicated a positive attitude of the people 
      towards eye donation. After this survey a simple protocol was devised It 
      was suggested that 'Eyes' should be requested for first and only if the 
      relatives were willing other organs requested. The Eye donation activists 
      of the country are already lobbying for a "required request law" in event 
      of a death in a hospital. This is likely to be soon passed by the 
      parliament and be enacted as a law. This same law can be extended for 
      solid organs in a brain death situation. If this is done it can give the 
      required boost to the program and make it obligatory for the hospitals 
      staff to ask for organs.
A major center Sri Ramachandra Research Medical College And Research 
      Center, undertaking cadaver transplants in the last 6 years has had a 
      brain death conversion rate of 19% (30/159). In this institution the ICU 
      staff have been sensitized to the issue of brain death and organ donation.
The number of fatal road traffic accidents every year in India is 
      constantly rising and averages at about 8,500 per year. At any given time 
      there are 8 to 10 brain dead patients in different ICU's in any major city 
      of the country. There is hence potentially a huge pool of brain death 
      donors available in India.
The unrelated activity is due to loop holes in the present THO Act as 
      under the Sub Clause (3), Clause 9 of Chapter II it states: "If any donor 
      authorizes the removal of any of his human organs before his death under 
      sub-section (1) of section 3 for transplantation into the body of such 
      recipient, not being a near relative as is specified by the donor, by 
      reason of affection or attachment towards the recipient or for any other 
      special reasons, such human organ shall not be removed and transplanted 
      without the prior approval of the Authorization Committee".
It is not necessarily difficult to find an unrelated donor who suddenly 
      develops an "affection or attachment" for the recipient provided he or she 
      is properly rewarded. Most of the unrelated transplants are a result of 
      the patients and clinicians using this section of the law to obtain 
      permission from the Government to do live unrelated transplants. This 
      aspect of the law has either to be scrapped or tightened so that only 
      genuine cases are helped, otherwise unrelated activity will continue with 
      the permission of government's authorization committee.
Mostly, private or non-governmental organizations have been working 
      towards the success of the transplantation program. Among these the 
      Initiative for Organ sharing group started by MOHAN Foundation in Tamil 
      Nadu has shared 68 organs in the last 2 years between five hospitals. This 
      is a encouraging start to the program. The foundation is also hoping to 
      affiliate with other similar organization in other regions such as FORTE 
      (Foundation for Organ Transplantation and Education) at Bangalore & ZTCC 
      (Zonal Transplant Co-coordinating Committee) at Mumbai that have also 
      similarly shared organs between different hospitals.
While this is true, we should be concerned that, in the 13 years since the 
      law was passed, the Indian law has been observed more in the breach. As 
      well documented by a series of investigations in Frontline magazine, the 
      affection clause is the loophole that actually drives the entire 
      transplant programme in the country. In state after state, authorisation 
      committees have rejected a microscopic percentage of applications under 
      this clause, turning a blind eye to what are obviously financial 
      transactions. For example, the Karnataka authorisation committee approved 
      1,012 of the 1,017 applications it received from January 1996 to February 
      2002.
The industry has always had the support of those in power, and those in 
      power have ways to get their dirty work done, as illustrated by the story 
      of Kumar's career. Senior Delhi police officials have confessed to picking 
      up one of Kumar's associates in January, but letting him free in exchange 
      for Rs 20 lakh – handed over by Kumar himself. Further, Kumar has been 
      running this business since 1994 at least. He was first arrested (as 
      Santosh Raut) in 1994 along with a group of surgeons and anaesthetists for 
      conducting kidney transplants at a nursing home in Mumbai. A 
      government-appointed committee concluded that as many as 450 kidney 
      transplants on foreign patients had been done in the nursing home from 
      1991 to 1994 though it had no license for conducting surgery. The 
      committee noted that there were no medical records, evidence of consent or 
      even evidence of basic medical infrastructure.
Kumar was arrested at least four times between 1994 and 2008 -- and 
      obtained bail each time, following which he would disappear and resurface, 
      running the same business in another part of the country.
Not one person is reported to have been prosecuted for violating THOA.
INDIA has a flourishing, and illegal, trade in human organs. And the 
      legislation designed to prevent it is failing.
On Jan 24, police unearthed an illegal kidney transplant racket being 
      operated from Haryana's Gurgaon town, on the outskirts of the national 
      capital. The people running the racket served clients from India and 
      abroad after obtaining kidneys illegally, often under force, from poor 
      people.
Every year, almost two lakh people in India need kidney transplants and 
      there are only 4,000 people donating them, reveals Narendra Saini, media 
      co-ordinator of the Indian Medical Association in Delhi. And this 
      discrepancy in demand and supply leads to cases like the deeds of Dr 
      Horror Amit Kumar, accused of running an illegal kidney racket out of 
      Gurgaon. The incident has raised many questions, including the efficacy of 
      the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.
Recently, a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Delhi High 
      Court, asking for exemption of dialysis kits from customs duty and making 
      the process of kidney transplants easier and prevent illegal kidney 
      transplants. He also demanded that the government initiate a programme for 
      donation of organs on the lines of eye donation camps and review the 1994 
      Human Organ Transplantation Act. But he was asked to file a fresh petition 
      due to some reasons.
On the eve of the World Kidney Day, the recommendations of the high 
      court-appointed Transplant of Human Organs Act Review Committee that is 
      awaiting implementation by the Health Ministry since three years became 
      the topic of discussion in the Delhi High Court.
Says Sanjay Ghosh, a Supreme Court lawyer, Obtaining an organ illegally 
      could be done in a life and death situation since ensuring that the 
      patient lives is more important than abiding by the law.
R.K. Sharma, secretary of the Indian Society of Nephrology in Lucknow, 
      observes that the government is considering second degree relatives for 
      the donation of organs. While the current law is good, if it is made easy 
      for people to donate organs there could be unrelated and professional 
      donors creeping in and thus the new law would become a double-edged 
      sword.
The object of the Act to prevent commercial dealing in kidneys has 
      failed, asserts Sardar Amjad Ali, a high court advocate in Calcutta. Ali 
      mentions that for a non relative to donate a kidney, an authorisation 
      committee has to approve the transplant but the supervision has been 
      dismal, leading to a thriving kidney racket in the country.
Joymalya Bagchi, an advocate at the Calcutta High Court, indicates that a 
      video of the consent of an individual could be made, in addition to the 
      written statement, during donation to avoid further legal complications. 
      There is a lack of transparency in the current dealings that is leading 
      to the law being broken, he asserts.
The medical fraternity, however, says the law is too stringent for 
      transplantation to be carried out legally all the time.
Says Narendra Saini of IMA, The section mentioning that only close 
      relatives can donate kidneys is too restrictive and needs to be widened. 
      Also the provision for non relatives to donate kidneys for attachment or 
      emotional reasons could be misused by any individual who could sell a 
      kidney illegally. Speaking of doctors like Amit Kumar, he says that he is 
      not a registered medical practitioner There are quack doctors performing 
      organ transplants in unregistered hospitals all over the country and this 
      is the core problem with the law being bypassed.
The government is now mooting the idea of amending the Transplantation of 
      Human Organs Act. Among the changes being considered are mandatory 
      declaration that patients are brain dead by all intensive care units (ICU) 
      of hospitals to help address the shortage of organs for donation in the 
      country.
The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in its order dated 6.9.2004 had set up a 
      Committee to examine the provisions of Transplantation of Human Organs 
      Act, 1994 and the Transplantation of Human Organs Rules, 1995. The report 
      was submitted on 25.5.2005. A National Consultation was held on 18.5.2007 
      and the report was submitted in the second fortnight of August, 2007. The 
      recommended changes required amendments in the Transplantation of Human 
      Organs Act, 1994 and the Rules framed there under. These changes are 
      intended to facilitate genuine cases, increase transparency in 
      transplantation procedures and to provide deterrent penalties for 
      violation of the law.
In so far as the Act is concerned, the following amendments have been 
      proposed:
i) To empower Union Territories, specially Government of NCT of Delhi to 
      have their own appropriate authority instead of DGHS and /or Additional DG 
      (Hospitals).
ii) To make the punishments under the Act harsh and cognizable for the 
      illegal transplantation activities to deter the offenders from committing 
      this crime.
iii) To provide for registration of the centers for removal of organs from 
      the cadavers and brain stem dead patients for harvesting of organs instead 
      of registration of centers for transplantations only.
However, the Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan feels that there is 
      no need to amend the Human Organ Transplantation Act, as the present law 
      is sufficient to serve the cause, and they just need to be implemented 
      properly. The comment came at a time when the health ministry was 
      considering to bring a change in the law to curb illegal organ 
      transplants. Experts have said that nearly 15 percent of adults in urban 
      India are diabetic and 40 percent of them are likely to develop kidney 
      problems, and every year over 150,000 new patients require dialysis or 
      kidney transplant.
Therefore, in order to promote donation of organs, the government has 
      planned to give incentives to the donor's family like lifelong free 
      medical check-up and care in the hospital where the organ donation took 
      place. Besides, a customized life insurance policy of Rs 2 lakh for three 
      years with one-time premium to be paid by the recipient in case of 
      mortality and preferred status in organ transplant waiting list if the 
      next-of-kin of a brain-dead donor requires a transplant in future.
To promote more brain death cadaver donation some changes are needed in 
      Human Organ Transplantation Act such as intimation of Brain death to 
      relatives, procedures in law to make it compulsory for the ICU staff to 
      suggest for organ donation and request their permission for the same. In 
      medico-legal cases-it should be made possible to under take 'post mortem' 
      at the same time as the ' Organ retrieval' surgery. Shifting patient from 
      one hospital for Organ donation to another for post mortem makes relatives 
      very emotionally traumatized and delays the process of handing over the 
      body.
It would be extremely fruitful if Grand parents are included in the near 
      related category and if we accept the policy of presumed consent, i.e. 
      every person dying of brain death should be presumed to have wished for 
      organ donation until a written refusal is made by the family.
Most importantly, there is a need to spread awareness at every level. 
      Surprisingly, Nurses and Medical students also do not know about the Act. 
      That means that they need to be educated more about the Act, along with 
      the rest of the population. It has been seen that the willingness to 
      donate organs is directly proportional to the level of education, which 
      needs to be increased.
No other field of medicine has raised so many ethical, moral, legal and 
      social issues as has organ transplantation. At present the very term 
      transplant is likely to conjure up an image of shady and dangerous 
      dealings in India. If we wish to improve upon the current situation, the 
      first step is total transparency on the part of the medical profession and 
      open, public, debate on this and related issues. Medical professionals 
      must set ethical guidelines and take action against violators. 
      Representatives of the common people must be included on the committees 
      that will oversee these operations.
We must restore organ transplantation to where it really belongs - not as 
      an example of all that is unethical and commercial but as a modern medical 
      advance permitting one human being to make the gift of life to another.

Human Organs Transplantation:
An organ transplant is a surgical operation where a failing or damaged 
      organ in the human body is removed and replaced with a new one. An organ 
      is a mass of specialized cells and tissues that work together to perform a 
      function in the body.
Organ Transplantation - Legal, Social And Ethical Issues: Organ 
      transplantation is an issue that must be dealt with sensitivity. Orienting 
      society to accepting the value of life after death' will go a long way in 
      strengthening transplantation as medical treatment.
Organ Transplantation And Its Legal Prospects:
The development and application of technologies will arguably be the major 
      driving force for the evolution of the world society in the first part of 
      our new century. In medicine, agriculture, material science, communication 
      and host of other areas, new technologies promise unimaginable changes in 
      our lives.

Introduction
Transplantation of human organs is a huge success in the field of medical science and technology. In medical terms, ‘transplant’ is referred to as a process in which a portion/part of the body or a complete organ is removed from its original site of an individual and transferred to a separate site in the different individual.
However, the number of patients desperately needing a transplant outnumbers the number of donors available, making it necessary for legislation to be in place to avoid illegal activity involving the commercialization of organ transplantation.
History Overview
Organ transplantation in India has a shorter history compared to the most developed countries in the world. The kidney transplant was first performed in India in the 1970s. Transplantation activities picked up in the 80s and early 90s but it was mainly restricted to live donor kidney transplants in selected urban areas. Slowly, with new clinics coming up and an increase in the availability of trained staff, kidney transplantation activities increased. However, this led to the famous kidney trade in India in the 80s which caught a wide media coverage. Foreigners patients started to flock to India for transplantation from a paid donor.
Considering the ongoing kidney scam in India, in 1991, the Central Government constituted a committee to make a report, which would be going to be the basis of legislation governing organ transplantation all over India. Moreover, it was also done to give a better definition of the term ‘brain death’.
In 1994, The Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA) was promulgated by the government of India. Moreover, the Transplantation of Human Organs Rules followed in 1995 and were last amended in 2014, increasing the scope of donation and including tissues for transplantation. The act made commercialization of organs a punishable offence and legalized the concept of brain death in India allowing deceased donation by obtaining organs from brain stem dead person.
What is Brain Death?
Brain death is referred to as a state where all the brain functions have stopped working and cannot be reversed. However, in such a condition the heart may still be working due to the presence of oxygen because of the ventilator. But the patient can safely be pronounced to be dead in such a situation.
According to the definition in the THOA, brain death is a stage when all functions of the brain-stem have permanently ceased. The same has to be verified by the board of Medical experts.
THOA Rules mention certain pre-conditions to be fulfilled by medical practitioners before declaring a patient ‘brain stem death’. It has to be declared by the medical expert board after they examine the body twice and at an interval of about six hours.
Regulatory Bodies
Advisory Committee
Constituted under the chairmanship of administrative expert, who is not below the rank of the Secretary to the State Government for a period of 2 years to aid.
Along with him/her, two medical experts possessing a medical postgraduate degree, with not less than 5 years of work experience in the field of organ or tissue transplantation.
Committee’s purpose is to aid and advise the appropriate authority (AA).
Authorization Committee (AC)
The purpose of this committee is to accept or reject the application of donors (other than relatives) to ensure that he/she is not being exploited for monetary consideration by making a donation.
The AC scrutinizes the joint application made by the donor and the recipient and conducts an interview to ensure there is a genuine intention among them both and make sure that the donor understands the potential risks of the surgery.
A hospital can have its own AC if they carry out more than 25 transplants per year.
Appropriate Authority (AA)
Appropriate Authority’s purpose is to regulate human organs:
Removal
Storage
Transplantation
The hospitals can only perform these functions after being licensed by the authorities.
2. However, the procedure of removal of the eyes of a dead donor is not required and is not governed by the authority and does not require licensing procedures.
3. The functions of the AA include:
Inspection and registration of hospitals for transplant surgery,
Enforcement of required standards for the hospital,
Conduct regular inspection of the hospital to examine the quality of transplantation and follow up medical care of donor and recipient, and
Conduct an investigation for any breach of the Act.
4. The AA issues a license to a hospital for a period of 5 years and after that it needs to be renewed. Each organ requires a separate license.
Competent Authority
It means the head or committee made by the institute carrying out the transplantation.
Any member from the transplant team can be its member.
It gives permission for the near-related transplants only.
Types of Donors
According to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, the donors can be categorised into three types:
Living Donors
A living donor is a person who is above the age of 18 years and has voluntarily authorized for the removal of his organ/tissue, during his lifetime. A living person can legally donate:
One Kidney as the donor’s body is capable of functioning adequately with one kidney.
A portion of Pancreas as half of the pancreas can adequately perform the pancreatic functions.
A part of his/her Liver as the other segment of the liver can regenerate after some time for both, the donor and the recipient.
However, living donors can broadly be categorized into three types:
Living Near Related Donors
Under this category, only immediate blood relations are accepted as donors, for example, parents, children and siblings. As per the THOA rule 2014, grandparents and grandchildren have also been included in the list. Moreover, spouses are also accepted as living donors under this category. However, they need to prove their relationship with the recipient by proper legal documents or medical genetic tests.
Living Non-near Donors
In such a case, the donor is not related to the recipient in any way and is willing to donate out of affection and attachment towards him/her. Permission is required in such a case which is granted by the Authorization committee by appearing in an interview.
SWAP Donors
This is suitable for cases where the near-relative donor is incompatible with the recipient. Such a provision involves swapping of the donor when the donor of the first pair is a match with the second recipient and donor of the second pair is a match with the first recipient. However, is it only permissible in the case of near-relative being the donors.
Foreign Donors
In this case, only those foreign donors are permitted who are ‘near-related’ to the recipient. However, Indian living donors who want to donate to a foreigner, other than a near relative, are not permitted as per the act. In case a foreigner comes to India for transplantation, the embassy of the country of origin must grant such permission and must certify the relationship between the donor and the recipient.

Deceased/Cadaver Donors
A donation, being a source of organs, can either be made after brain stem death (brain death) or after cardiac death (when the patient’s heart stops beating). A person can give his consent during his/her lifetime, if he/she is more than 18 years of age and if he/she is willing to donate his/her organs after he/she dies. After certification of brain death of the patient, it has been now made mandatory for the medical practitioner to ask the patient’s near relative or the person being in lawful possession of the body about their plans of organ donation, even if the patient has already consented for the same during his lifetime.
However, the cost of maintaining the body of the deceased person, retrieval of the organs or the tissue, their preservation and transportation will not be borne by the family of the donor and shall be borne either by the recipient or the institution as already declared by the respective state government.
Also, now a person has an option to give consent for the same while applying for his driving license. His/her preference would reflect on it.
Punishment under the Act
As per Section 18 of this Act, any person who is responsible for the removal of a human organ/tissue with the authority of doing so can be punished with imprisonment which can extend to 10 years and with fine which can extend to Rs. 20 lakhs. In case that person is a medical professional, his name will be reported by the AA to the State Medical Council to take appropriate action including removing his name from the register of the council for 3 years for the first offense and if he/she commits an offense subsequently, then remove it permanently.
As per the Section 19, if any person involves himself/herself in the commercial dealing of human organs then such person can be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than 5 years but can extend to 10 years and will also be liable for a fine which will not be less than Rs. 20 lakhs but can extend to Rs. 1 crore.
As per Section 20. If any person violates any other provision of this act, he/she can be punished with imprisonment for a term which can extend to 5 years or with fine which may extend to Rs. 20 lakhs.
Current Scenario in India
To do a diagnosis of a brain death donor, an ICU is required because it has the facilities to sustain the other organ system of the patient. But, the problem is, such ICUs are few in number and are mainly located in big metropolitan cities. These are already overburdened, unstaffed and lack a central command structure to function effectively. So, on one side there is a patient who is dying, and on another who is already dead but needs proper attention for successful retrieval of body organs. This situation automatically makes the medical professionals give less priority to the brain dead patient.
The act of obtaining consent(informed consent) from relatives can be troublesome. The doctor handling the treatment, might not be motivated enough to seek such consent from the relatives. In other cases, the patients may lack relatives or their relatives may not be present when the diagnosis of brain death is carried out. Although the Act gives the right to the medical practitioner for the removal of organs for a donation if the body isn’t claimed within forty-eight hours after death by its relatives. If the relatives of the person are traced after the duration and they object to the act, then it could be a huge problem. Moreover, the decision of organ donation is not taken by a single relative and the whole family may need persuasion which results in loss of crucial time.
Transplantation is a complex and expensive process and there is no state funding for the same. It has been noted that most of the deceased donation has been taking place in the private sector. Moreover, a large number of donors and recipients are from private hospitals. This is leading to an imbalance regarding accessibility, regardless of their ability to pay, as the majority of the organs are currently going to the rich and the same option is not available to the poor sector of the society.
Conclusion
Organ transplantation is one of the biggest achievements in medical science and technology. However, the fruit to this success may not be available to all. Cadaveric donation in India, in its present form, largely benefits the rich and supports a tiny percentage of patients requesting it. It also has led to the exploitation of the poor.
Therefore, though we actively aim to raise donation rates we must not lose sight of this big picture. Many of the ideas and principles in modern transplantation of deceased donors come from the developed West, where both social views and health systems vary from those in India. We, in India, need to build an equal, open and not oppressive framework. This will be a slow and challenging process, which may also entail linking to the bigger battle for an advanced and accessible healthcare system for all.

Executive Summary
Organ transplantation surgery has saved countless lives since its advent in the 1950s. As the techniques and technologies used in transplantation medicine improve, positive outcomes for donors and recipients are increasing. Demand for this treatment, however, far exceeds organ availability. It is estimated that legal transplants performed cover the needs of only 10% of all patients on waiting lists worldwide. As a result, thousands of people die every year waiting for this procedure.
The desperate need for organ transplantation surgeries has given rise to a lucrative, transnational criminal enterprise that enables organ seekers to purchase organs from donors. This enterprise, commonly referred to as organ trafficking, is a global phenomenon. Even though it is illegal in most countries, some estimates indicate that trafficked organs account for up to 10% of organ transplants performed around the world, with profits conservatively estimated to be between US$840 million to US$1.7 billion annually.
Illegally trafficked organs are very expensive. According to some reports, the cost of a kidney, the most commonly trafficked organ, can range from US$50,000 to US$120,000. Thus, purchasers are normally wealthy persons from developed nations such as Canada. Because the purchase is generally conducted through a vast network that includes a broker who acts as an intermediary between the organ buyer and seller, a local recruiter, as well as medical professionals and local hospitals performing the illicit organ removal, very little money is left for the “donor.” Victims are commonly from poor and vulnerable populations in developing countries. Many are reported to have been misled, coerced or otherwise forced into selling their organs.
While organ trafficking is an internationally recognized problem, and attempts to prevent and prohibit it have experienced limited success, this underground crime remains a pervasive problem in many parts of the world. Part of the challenge is that many countries, including Canada, do not explicitly prohibit travelling abroad for organ transplantation surgeries that have been organized through illicit means. Thus far, legislative attempts in Canada to strengthen federal laws relating to organ trafficking have been unsuccessful.
This Background Paper provides an overview of organ trafficking and Canada’s involvement in this illicit activity. It identifies key terms; lays out some of the main issues; and summarizes actions taken by the international community, as well as Canada, to combat organ trafficking.
1 Introduction
A global shortage of organs for transplantation has given rise to a lucrative trade in trafficking organs or trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ transplantation. 1 These practices, conventionally referred to as organ trafficking, are prohibited by international law as part of a general prohibition on human trafficking. 2 Governmental and non-governmental organizations, including medical associations, have agreed in an official declaration that this prohibition includes any transplantation where the organ donor receives financial gain or comparable advantage from the transaction. 3
Organ trafficking has become a global problem. Estimates indicate that trafficked organs account for up to 10% of organ transplants performed around the world, with profits conservatively estimated at US$840 million to US$1.7 billion annually. 4 Increasingly, in an effort to exploit the gap between the supply and demand for organs, criminal organizations that traffic in human beings are expanding their practice to include organ trafficking. 5
Over the past several decades, over 100 countries have passed legislation banning or strengthening existing laws prohibiting the trade in organs. 6 Additionally, several governmental and professional bodies have advanced initiatives to regulate domestic and international organ transplantation and to prevent organ trafficking. 7 Taken together, these initiatives propose professional, regulatory and international law solutions to address an increasingly complex global criminal enterprise.
This Background Paper identifies key terms and elements of the illegal practice of organ trafficking and summarizes the actions that the international community and Canada have been taking to combat the practice.
2 Terminology
The following definitions include some of the most commonly used terms in the literature on organ transplantation and organ trafficking: 8
“Organ donation” is defined as the consented donation, without compensation, of human cells, tissues, organs or a part of an organ intended for transplantation into another person. 9 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), organs may be removed from a deceased person when legal requirements pertaining to consent have been met “and there is no reason to believe that the deceased person objected” to organ removal. 10
“Organ donors” can be deceased or living people. Deceased donors can give their kidneys, pancreas, liver, lungs, heart and intestinal organs. Living donors can give a kidney or a portion of the liver, lung or intestine. 11
“Organ removal/harvesting” means the process of removing and preserving vital and healthy organs from living or deceased donors for the purpose of transplantation.
“Organ trafficking” is an umbrella term that covers a number of unethical or illegal practices. It consists of any of the following activities:
removing organs from living or deceased donors without valid consent or authorisation or in exchange for financial gain or comparative advantage to the donor and/or a third person;
any transportation, manipulation, transplantation or other use of such organs;
offering any undue advantage to, or requesting the same by, a healthcare professional, public official, or employee of a private sector entity to facilitate or perform such removal or use;
soliciting or recruiting donors or recipients, where carried out for financial gain or comparative advantage; or
attempting to commit, or aiding or abetting the commission of, any of these acts. 12
“Trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal” means
the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of the removal of organs. 13
“Transplant/organ commercialism” is “a policy or practice in which an organ is treated as a commodity, including by being bought or sold or used for material gain.” 14
“Transplantation” is “[t]he transfer … of human cells, tissues or organs from a donor to a recipient with the aim of restoring function(s) in the body.” 15
“Travel for transplantation” is defined as “[t]he movement of persons across jurisdictional borders for transplantation purposes.” 16
The Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism (Declaration of Istanbul), widely recognized as an important guide for governmental and professional bodies in the field of transplantation, also distinguishes between travel for transplantation and “transplant tourism.” Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if it
involves trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal or trafficking in human organs, or if the resources (organs, professionals and transplant centres) devoted to providing transplants to non-resident patients undermine the country’s ability to provide transplant services for its own population. 17
Transplant tourism includes, for example, a patient travelling from Canada to another country to obtain a kidney commercially, or receiving an organ from a foreign donor outside of an officially regulated bilateral or multilateral organ-sharing program. 18 By contrast, an example of proper travel for transplantation would be a recipient having dual citizenship in their country of residence and the destination country, and wishing to undergo transplantation from a live donor who is a relative in the destination country. 19
3 Key Issues in Organ Trafficking
Since its advent in the 1950s, organ transplantation as treatment for patients with terminal organ failure has become increasingly common across the globe. 20 Continuous advances in medical technology and transplantation medicine have led to an increase in the demand for organs. 21 However, demand for organs far exceeds the supply. It is estimated that the current number of legal transplants performed covers the needs of only 10% of all patients on waiting lists worldwide. 22 The shortage of available organs has prompted countries to develop procedures and systems to increase supply, mainly through the improvement, expansion and promotion of deceased donation programs. This alone, however, “is not enough to fill the gap between demand and supply of organs.” 23
As the demand for organs outpaces the supply, transplant commercialism and organ trafficking, both of which involve the illegal buying and selling of organs, is increasing. This trend has been observed despite the fact that almost all countries in the world prohibit compensated organ donation, a practice widely viewed as “unethical and exploitative” and harming “poor and powerless people.” 24 The WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation (discussed in section 4.3 of this Background Paper) permit compensation for the costs of making donations (including medical expenses and lost earnings for live donors), but prohibit payment for organs, which is “likely to take unfair advantage of the poorest and most vulnerable groups, undermines altruistic donation, and leads to profiteering and human trafficking.” 25
Consequently, organs have become a valuable and profitable black-market commodity involving transnational crime syndicates operating “highly organized” networks across national borders. 26 According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the illicit practices involved in the illegal organ trade remain among the most difficult crimes to detect. As a result, awareness of the crime among criminal justice practitioners, law enforcement and policymakers remains low, and enforcement of the crime is generally not a priority, although some jurisdictions have improved on this front. 27 This lack of awareness exists in spite of the sheer number of actors involved in the trade in illicit organs, including the broker who acts as the intermediary between the organ buyer and seller, the local recruiter who identifies vulnerable people willing to sell their organs, and the medical professionals and local hospitals performing the illicit organ removal. 28
As noted in the introduction to this Background Paper, organ trafficking is estimated to generate between US$840 million and US$1.7 billion in illegal profits per year. A 2017 report by Global Financial Integrity estimates that in 2014, approximately 12,000 illegal transplantations were performed around the globe, of which two thirds involved kidneys. 29 The same report estimates that an organ buyer can pay anywhere from US$50,000 to US$120,000 for a kidney on the black market. Meanwhile, vendors on average receive less than 10% of the buyer’s payment, with the majority going to traffickers and other intermediaries. 30 By way of comparison with the cost of sanctioned kidney transplantation operations, in the United States, the estimated average billed charge for the transplantation of a kidney is US$442,500, including pre- and post-operative care. 31 In Canada, in 2019, the first-year cost of a transplant to the health care system was estimated to be $66,000. Costs related to the transplant in subsequent years are estimated to be $23,000 per year. 32
Cases of organ trafficking are reported all over the world. According to UNODC, trafficking for the removal of organs was detected in 25 countries between 2003 and 2016, mainly in North Africa and the Middle East, but cases have been noted in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Central and South America. 33 Other commentators have noted that those who are most commonly targeted for organ trafficking, commercialization or transplant tourism appear to be vulnerable and impoverished people in China, Egypt, India, Iraq, Pakistan and the Philippines, as well as countries in Central and South America and in Eastern Europe. Victims are predominantly male and between 20 and 40 years of age. They are often misled about the nature and medical consequences of the transplantation procedure, and numerous studies reveal that nearly all organ sellers regret having done so. Once recruited, victims having doubts are often coerced into going through with the procedure by violence or intimidation. 34
On the demand side, the practice of travelling abroad for a commercial transplant has been reported among nationals of Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and countries in the Middle East and Western Europe. Organ recipients travelling abroad typically do so out of desperation due to declining health and poor prospects for obtaining a legitimate organ transplant in their home country. Recipients may learn of transplant tourism opportunities by word-of-mouth or online advertisements, among other sources. 35
Commercial transplants performed abroad are dangerous not only for the donors but also the recipients, possibly because a regulatory framework to ensure safety of the procedure and organ viability is lacking. A study conducted between 1998 and 2013 at a Toronto hospital found that patients who had a kidney transplant outside Canada were three to four times as likely to die or lose the organ as those who received a kidney transplant in Canada and were also at greater risk of returning home with diseases like hepatitis or tuberculosis, among other complications. 36
Organ trafficking is global in scope and targets typical donor and recipient profiles. Donor countries include countries in South America, Eastern Europe, and South and East Asia. Recipient countries include Canada, the United States, Australia and countries in the Middle East and East Asia. The typical organ donor is a 28-year-old male with an average annual income of $480, while the typical organ recipient is a 48-year-old male with an average annual income of $53,000. 37
4 International Initiatives to Combat Forced Organ Removal and Trafficking of Organs
International organizations, governments and professional associations around the world have agreed on several major international initiatives to regulate organ transplantation and combat organ trafficking. What follows are short descriptions of three major international initiatives. 38
4.1 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime
On 13 May 2002 Canada ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol). 39 It is the first global legally binding instrument with an agreed definition of trafficking in persons, which is defined to include trafficking in persons for the purpose of removing their organs:
“Trafficking in persons” shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. 40
4.2 Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism
The Declaration of Istanbul is the first international declaration to distinguish between transplant tourism and travel for transplantation while also encouraging direct, specific action from states. It was first adopted in 2008 at an international meeting organized by the Transplantation Society and the International Society of Nephrology. The Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group (DICG) was established in 2010 to oversee the dissemination and endorsement of the document. The DICG published a new edition of the declaration in 2018 following public consultations with relevant stakeholders. The Declaration of Istanbul is intended to be a guidance document for policymakers and health professionals rather than a legally binding instrument. Numerous national and international medical societies and governmental bodies involved in organ transplantation have endorsed (i.e., agreed to uphold the principles of) the declaration, including several from Canada. 41 According to its preamble, the Declaration of Istanbul
expresses the determination of donation and transplant professionals and their colleagues in related fields that the benefits of transplantation be maximized and shared equitably with those in need, without reliance on unethical and exploitative practices that have harmed poor and powerless persons around the world. 42
The Declaration of Istanbul sets out 11 principles. 43 Some focus on prevention, such as Principle 1, which calls on governments to “develop and implement ethically and clinically sound programs for the prevention and treatment of organ failure” 44 and Principle 6, which asks governments to ensure transparency and accountability in organ donation, allocation and transplantation practices. Others focus on prohibition, including calling for the criminalization of organ trafficking and trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal (Principle 3) and the implementation of strategies to discourage or prevent transplant tourism (Principle 10). The principles also underscore the importance of equitable access to donation and transplantation services (Principle 7) and the need for countries to strive to achieve self-sufficiency in organ donation and transplantation (Principle 11).
4.3 World Health Organization’s Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation
The WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation (WHO Guiding Principles) build on previous WHO resolutions that expressed the WHO ’s “concern over commercial trade in organs and the need for global standards for transplantation.” 45 Its 11 guiding principles are aimed at ensuring that states provide an “orderly, ethical and acceptable framework for the acquisition and transplantation” 46 of organs, including
prohibiting any monetary payment or other financial reward for organ donation; 47
allowing live donations only on condition of voluntary informed consent and free of any undue influence or coercion; 48
ensuring that organs, cells and tissues are allocated solely according to clinical criteria and ethical norms, and not based on financial gain or other considerations; 49
banning health insurers from covering transplantation involving organs obtained through exploiting, coercing or offering payment to the donor or the deceased donor’s next of kin; 50
advocating for deceased organ donation so that it may achieve its maximum therapeutic potential; 51 and
recommending that living donations be domestically regulated and, in general, come from donors that have a genetic, legal or emotional connection to the recipients. 52
Overall, the WHO Guiding Principles provide a road map for member states to establish ethically sound transplantation programs. However, since the principles are not legally binding, they lack an enforcement provision or mechanism and do not require member states to report on their implementation of the recommendations. While the WHO Guiding Principles do not address organ trafficking directly, they do provide clear standards by which countries can address the supply side of organ transplantation.
4.4 Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Organs
The Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs (Council of Europe Convention) opened for signature on 25 March 2015 and entered into force on 1 March 2018 upon receiving sufficient ratifications. 53 As of October 2020, 10 states had ratified the Council of Europe Convention: Albania, Croatia, Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Portugal and Switzerland. 54 The Council of Europe Convention is the first legally binding international instrument devoted solely to organ trafficking and is also open to Canada for ratification. According to Article 1, the purposes of the Council of Europe Convention are as follows:
to prevent and combat the trafficking in human organs by providing for the criminalisation of certain acts;
to protect the rights of victims of the offences established in accordance with this Convention; [and]
to facilitate co-operation at national and international levels on action against the trafficking in human organs. 55
Article 23 also establishes a committee of the parties to the Council of Europe Convention to monitor its implementation.
4.5 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 71/322
On 8 September 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 71/322, entitled Strengthening and promoting effective measures and international cooperation on organ donation and transplantation to prevent and combat trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human organs.56 The resolution urges member states to, among other measures,
“prevent and combat trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human organs, in accordance with their obligations under international and national law,” including by prosecuting and punishing the illicit activities involved in organ trafficking;
ratify or accede to the Palermo Protocol; 57
consider adopting a number of measures related to organ transplantation, in accordance with their domestic legal systems and national legislation and in line with the WHO Guiding Principles; 58 and
develop “ways of protecting victims of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and, as appropriate, ways of addressing the vulnerability of those individuals who sell their organs” in their domestic legislation. 59
5 National Initiatives to Combat Forced Organ Removal and Trafficking of Organs
5.1 Canada
As is the case in other countries, the demand for organs in Canada significantly outpaces supply. In 2019, over 4,300 people were waiting for organ transplants, 3,014 organs were transplanted, and 249 people died waiting for a transplant. 60 Canada ranked 19 th among 70 countries in 2019 for the deceased organ donor rate, with a rate of 20.56 per million persons (PMP). 61 By comparison, the deceased organ donor rate of the top-ranked country, Spain, was 49 PMP. For living organ donors, Canada ranked 16 th in 2019, with a rate of 14.98 PMP. Turkey ranked first the same year, with 53.02 PMP.62
Canada is one of the top countries of origin for patients seeking organs abroad. 63 Currently, Canada does not have a law that bans Canadians from travelling abroad to receive a transplant, also known as transplant tourism. 64 However, as will be explained in section 5.1.1 of this Background Paper, the Criminal Code (the Code) does prohibit Canadian citizens and permanent residents from exploiting someone outside Canada to have an organ or tissue removed.
5.1.1 Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons for the Purpose of Organ Removal
Under the Code, 65 trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is prohibited. Sections 279.01 to 279.03 criminalize trafficking in persons and related offences, such as receiving a material benefit from trafficking in persons or withholding travel documents to facilitate trafficking in persons. According to section 279.01(1),
[e]very person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation is guilty of an indictable offence.
“Exploitation” is defined under section 279.04(1) of the Code, which states:
[A] person exploits another person if they cause them to provide, or offer to provide, labour or a service by engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or service.
Section 279.04(3) of the Code clarifies that trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is included in the definition of exploitation:
For the purposes of sections 279.01 to 279.03, a person exploits another person if they cause them, by means of deception or the use or threat of force or of any other form of coercion, to have an organ or tissue removed.
Trafficking in persons is an indictable offence. If the perpetrator kidnaps, commits an aggravated assault or sexual assault, or causes the victim’s death during the commission of the offence, the offence is punishable by a maximum term of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of five years (six years if the victim was under 18). In all other cases, trafficking in persons is punishable by a maximum of 14 years and a mandatory minimum of four years’ imprisonment (five years if the victim was under 18).
In addition, according to section 7(4.11) of the Code, any Canadian citizen or permanent resident who commits an offence listed in sections 279.01 to 279.03 outside Canada “shall be deemed to commit that [offence] in Canada.” This section of the Code ensures that the offence of trafficking in persons applies extraterritorially.
There have been several attempts in the last 10 years to amend the Code to deal more explicitly with the trafficking of human organs and other body parts through private members’ bills in the Senate and the House of Commons. 66 For example, Bill S-240, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (trafficking in human organs) died on the Order Paper at the dissolution of the 42 nd Parliament, having passed third reading in the House of Commons. Sponsored by Senator Salma Ataullahjan, Bill S-240 would have amended the Code to add a specific provision criminalizing trafficking in human organs, including the removal of organs without the person’s informed consent or for financial consideration, by anyone in Canada or by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident outside Canada. These offences would have been punishable by a maximum of 14 years’ imprisonment. The bill would also have established an organ transplant registry to help authorities identify instances of organ trafficking. Finally, the bill would have amended the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to make a permanent resident or foreign national inadmissible to Canada if they had engaged in organ trafficking.
5.2 Other Jurisdictions
5.2.1 Prohibition of Organ Trafficking
Most countries’ legislation banning organ trafficking has focused on organ sales within the country’s jurisdiction. This approach does not impose liability for nationals engaging in transplant tourism abroad. Several countries, however, have enacted laws to discourage or prevent their nationals from travelling abroad for organs for transplantation. Israel, for example, prohibits health insurance companies from reimbursing the medical expenses of patients who travel abroad to receive transplants while providing for full reimbursement of legitimate expenses associated with organ donation. 67 Legislation in Taiwan stipulates that patients who receive organ transplants abroad must provide certain information in writing regarding the transplant they received in order to be eligible for medical care in Taiwan. 68
Destination countries for transplant tourism have also implemented laws to curb this practice, with some success. For example, legislation enacted by the Philippines in 2009 prohibiting living local donors from providing organs for transplantation to foreign nationals led to a significant decrease in transplant tourism to the country, from 531 cases in 2007 to two in 2011. 69 India enacted legislation in 1994 that restricted living organ donations to related individuals in order to discourage transplant tourism. However, the law permitted non-related living organ donations in “altruistic” cases. As a result, organ traffickers disguised illegal organ transactions as voluntary donations, leading the Indian government to impose harsher penalties for, and increased oversight of, the organ trade. 70
5.2.2 Legalization of the Organ Trade
Iran is the only country in the world that allows living paid kidney donation. Prospective donors in Iran must obtain approval from the government. If approved, they receive US$2,000 to US$5,000 in compensation from recipients, in addition to receiving one year of free health insurance and a US$1,200 government subsidy. 71 The costs of the transplant are paid by the government with no incentives allowed to transplantation teams. Regulations aim to prevent kidney transplant tourism by requiring that both the donor and recipient be Iranian. The Iranian Society of Organ Transplantation is tasked with monitoring all living unrelated kidney donations for ethical violations. 72
Despite the program’s apparent successes and robust regulations, most kidney vendors in Iran fall below the poverty line, highlighting the systemic inequality between donors and recipients in the organ trade even when made legal. 73 Furthermore, many sellers still turn to the black market to sell their kidneys to buyers willing to pay thousands more than the government offers. 74
6 Preventative Measures and the Role of Health Care Professionals
As previously stated, the root cause of organ trafficking is the significant lack of organs available for transplantation via legitimate means. Following the Third WHO Global Consultation on Organ Donation and Transplantation in 2011, participants, including government representatives and medical professionals, issued the Madrid Resolution on Organ Donation and Transplantation, which calls on governments to pursue “self-sufficiency in organs for transplantation” as “it is the only safeguard against the temptation of yielding to trade in human organs.” 75 Self-sufficiency requires not only strategies aimed at increasing the availability of organs but also those intended to prevent diseases leading to organ failure. 76
With respect to human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal specifically, the Routledge Handbook of Human Trafficking states that essential prevention measures include
the establishment of a regulatory framework and the development of professional guidelines for the comprehensive screening of prospective living donors, particularly from the psycho-social perspective, so as to rule out coercion, fraud, deception or abuse of a position of vulnerability. In addition, incorporating a living donor advocate into transplant programmes should become a standard practice. Living donation programmes should pay special attention to non-resident living donors – for whom appropriate psycho-social screening may be particularly challenging. Protocols in place should be able to differentiate between proper travel for transplantation and situations where the apparently willing prospective donor may be subject to exploitation. Transplantation practises should be developed within highly regulated and transparent systems subject to strict oversight. Similarly, transplant centres should be subject to specific authorization and regular audits. 77
The handbook also highlights the need for states to raise awareness of the illegal organ trade and to conduct outreach to populations at risk of being trafficked for their organs. It further maintains that states should equip health care professionals and public officials dealing with potential organ donors and recipients with adequate information aimed at preventing and combatting the illicit organ trade. 78
Physicians have also been identified as playing “a pivotal role in discouraging” transplant tourism in source countries such as Canada, “particularly if they are supported by law and policy reform.” 79 For example, physicians could advise patients considering transplant tourism of the medical risks associated with receiving a transplant abroad, as well as the harms to the organ donor and illegality of the organ trade. 80
7 Conclusion
Organ trafficking is a global issue that persists largely undetected despite netting significant profits for organized crime groups. All countries are affected – the victims of organ trafficking are typically found among poor and vulnerable populations in developing countries, while the recipients of illicit organs are usually from wealthier countries such as Canada. Organ trafficking is fuelled by a significant lack of organs available by legitimate means in virtually all jurisdictions, including in Canada where patients can wait years for a transplant. Legislative attempts in Canada to strengthen federal laws relating to organ trafficking have been unsuccessful thus far. While some international and domestic initiatives to prevent and prohibit organ trafficking have had positive results, this underground crime remains a pervasive worldwide problem.

Summary
Organ donation and transplant rates vary widely across the globe, but there remains an almost universal shortage of deceased donors. The unmet need for transplants has resulted in many systematic approaches to increase donor rates, but there have also been practices that have crossed the boundaries of legal and ethical acceptability. Recent years have seen intense interest from international political organizations, led by the World Health Organization, and professional bodies, led by The Transplantation Society. Their efforts have focused on the development of a series of legal and ethical frameworks, designed to encourage all countries to eradicate unacceptable practices while introducing programmes that strive to achieve national or regional self-sufficiency in meeting the need for organ transplants. These programmes should seek to reduce both the need for transplantation and also develop deceased donation to its maximum potential. Living donation remains the mainstay of transplantation in many parts of the world, and many of the controversial—and unacceptable—areas of practice are found in the exploitation of living donors. However, until lessons are learnt, and applied, from countries with highly developed deceased donor programmes, these abuses of human rights will be difficult to eradicate. A clear international framework is now in place to achieve this.

Editor's key points
Rates of deceased donation vary markedly around the world.
Living donation is the mainstay of transplantation in many countries.
Many of the unacceptable transplantation practices come from the exploitation of vulnerable living donors.
All developments in donation should have equity, quality, and safety at their core.
Transplantation is the best and sometimes only form of treatment for many patients with end-stage organ failure. Organ donation and transplantation have been the subject of extensive international interest in the past 10 yr at both governmental and professional levels. This interest has been driven by two main factors. First, the universal shortage of organs for transplantation and the wide international variation in donation and transplantation activity. Secondly, the need to ensure that all developments have a firm basis in legal and ethical practice with equity, quality, and safety at their core.
Any comprehensive review of organ transplantation needs to consider both deceased and living donation. Indeed, while deceased donation fails to meet the need for transplantable organs in all countries, it is almost non-existent in many countries, and it is this that has led to ever-increasing use of living donors as a source of kidneys and more recently also livers. Many of the controversial—and unacceptable—aspects of living donation stem from this, and while interest sometimes appears to be focused on steps to stop these practices, there is also an equal emphasis on the need for all countries to work to achieve ‘self-sufficiency’ by establishing effective deceased donation programmes.
The international response has been to create two sets of global agreements: an international governmental response created through the World Health Assembly and World Health Organization (WHO), and a professional response created through international societies spearheaded by The Transplantation Society and the International Society of Nephrology.
Led by the WHO, the World Health Assembly resolved in May 2010 to endorse revised Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation. 1 These refer to both living and deceased donation, are accompanied by a commentary, and contain 11 specific and carefully worded principles (Table 1 ). It is stated that ‘The (following) Guiding Principles are intended to provide an orderly, ethical and acceptable framework for the acquisition and transplantation of human cells, tissues and organs for therapeutic purposes. Each jurisdiction will determine the means of implementing the Guiding Principles’.
The professional response to these challenges have been led by The Transplantation Society, in association with other international professional societies, through publications such as the Amsterdam Forum, 2 the Vancouver meeting, 3 and importantly the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism. 4 Much of the section below on payment for organs and transplant tourism is based on this Declaration.
Table 1
WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue & Organ Transplantation
 1
Cells, tissues, and organs may be removed from the bodies of deceased persons for the purpose of transplantation if: any consent required by law is obtained, and there is no reason to believe that the deceased person objected to such removal
 2
Physicians determining that a potential donor has died should not be directly involved in cell, tissue, or organ removal from the donor or subsequent transplantation procedures; nor should they be responsible for the care of any intended recipient of such cells, tissues, and organs
 3
Donation from deceased persons should be developed to its maximum therapeutic potential, but adult living persons may donate organs as permitted by domestic regulations. In general, living donors should be genetically, legally, or emotionally related to their recipients. Live donations are acceptable when the donor's informed and voluntary consent is obtained, when professional care of donors is ensured and follow-up is well organized, and when selection criteria for donors are scrupulously applied and monitored. Live donors should be informed of the probable risks, benefits, and consequences of donation in a complete and understandable fashion; they should be legally competent and capable of weighing the information; and they should be acting willingly, free of any undue influence or coercion
 4
No cells, tissues, or organs should be removed from the body of a living minor for the purpose of transplantation other than narrow exceptions allowed under national law.
Specific measures should be in place to protect the minor and, wherever possible, the minor's assent should be obtained before donation. What is applicable to minors also applies to any legally incompetent person
 5
Cells, tissues, and organs should only be donated freely, without any monetary payment or other reward of monetary value. Purchasing, or offering to purchase, cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation, or their sale by living persons or by the next of kin for deceased persons, should be banned. The prohibition on sale or purchase of cells, tissues, and organs does not preclude reimbursing reasonable and verifiable expenses incurred by the donor, including loss of income, or paying the costs of recovering, processing, preserving, and supplying human cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation
 6
Promotion of altruistic donation of human cells, tissues, or organs by means of advertisement or public appeal may be undertaken in accordance with domestic regulation. Advertising the need for or availability of cells, tissues, or organs, with a view to offering or seeking payment to individuals for their cells, tissues, or organs, or, to the next of kin, where the individual is deceased, should be prohibited. Brokering that involves payment to such individuals or to third parties should also be prohibited
 7
Physicians and other health professionals should not engage in transplantation procedures, and health insurers and other payers should not cover such procedures, if the cells, tissues, or organs concerned have been obtained through exploitation or coercion of, or payment to, the donor or the next of kin of a deceased donor
 8
All health-care facilities and professionals involved in cell, tissue, or organ procurement and transplantation procedures should be prohibited from receiving any payment that exceeds the justifiable fee for the services rendered
 9
The allocation of organs, cells, and tissues should be guided by clinical criteria and ethical norms, not financial or other considerations. Allocation rules, defined by appropriately constituted committees, should be equitable, externally justified, and transparent
 10
High-quality, safe, and efficacious procedures are essential for donors and recipients alike. The long-term outcomes of cell, tissue, and organ donation and transplantation should be assessed for the living donor and the recipient in order to document benefit and harm. The level of safety, efficacy, and quality of human cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation, as health products of an exceptional nature, must be maintained and optimized on an ongoing basis. This requires implementation of quality systems including traceability and vigilance, with adverse events and reactions reported, both nationally and for exported human products
 11
The organization and execution of donation and transplantation activities, and their clinical results, must be transparent and open to scrutiny, while ensuring that the personal anonymity and privacy of donors and recipients are always protected
 1
Cells, tissues, and organs may be removed from the bodies of deceased persons for the purpose of transplantation if: any consent required by law is obtained, and there is no reason to believe that the deceased person objected to such removal
 2
Physicians determining that a potential donor has died should not be directly involved in cell, tissue, or organ removal from the donor or subsequent transplantation procedures; nor should they be responsible for the care of any intended recipient of such cells, tissues, and organs

High-quality, safe, and efficacious procedures are essential for donors and recipients alike.

The organization and execution of donation and transplantation activities, and their clinical results, must be transparent and open to scrutiny, while ensuring that the personal anonymity and privacy of donors and recipients are always protected
 1
Cells, tissues, and organs may be removed from the bodies of deceased persons for the purpose of transplantation if: any consent required by law is obtained, and there is no reason to believe that the deceased person objected to such removal
 2
Physicians determining that a potential donor has died should not be directly involved in cell, tissue, or organ removal from the donor or subsequent transplantation procedures; nor should they be responsible for the care of any intended recipient of such cells, tissues, and organs
 3
Donation from deceased persons should be developed to its maximum therapeutic potential, but adult living persons may donate organs as permitted by domestic regulations. In general, living donors should be genetically, legally, or emotionally related to their recipients. Live donations are acceptable when the donor's informed and voluntary consent is obtained, when professional care of donors is ensured and follow-up is well organized, and when selection criteria for donors are scrupulously applied and monitored. Live donors should be informed of the probable risks, benefits, and consequences of donation in a complete and understandable fashion; they should be legally competent and capable of weighing the information; and they should be acting willingly, free of any undue influence or coercion
 4
No cells, tissues, or organs should be removed from the body of a living minor for the purpose of transplantation other than narrow exceptions allowed under national law.
Specific measures should be in place to protect the minor and, wherever possible, the minor's assent should be obtained before donation. What is applicable to minors also applies to any legally incompetent person
 5
Cells, tissues, and organs should only be donated freely, without any monetary payment or other reward of monetary value. Purchasing, or offering to purchase, cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation, or their sale by living persons or by the next of kin for deceased persons, should be banned. The prohibition on sale or purchase of cells, tissues, and organs does not preclude reimbursing reasonable and verifiable expenses incurred by the donor, including loss of income, or paying the costs of recovering, processing, preserving, and supplying human cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation
 6
Promotion of altruistic donation of human cells, tissues, or organs by means of advertisement or public appeal may be undertaken in accordance with domestic regulation. Advertising the need for or availability of cells, tissues, or organs, with a view to offering or seeking payment to individuals for their cells, tissues, or organs, or, to the next of kin, where the individual is deceased, should be prohibited. Brokering that involves payment to such individuals or to third parties should also be prohibited
 7
Physicians and other health professionals should not engage in transplantation procedures, and health insurers and other payers should not cover such procedures, if the cells, tissues, or organs concerned have been obtained through exploitation or coercion of, or payment to, the donor or the next of kin of a deceased donor
 8
All health-care facilities and professionals involved in cell, tissue, or organ procurement and transplantation procedures should be prohibited from receiving any payment that exceeds the justifiable fee for the services rendered

A further joint initiative between governmental and professional organizations was the Resolution of Madrid, co-sponsored by the European Commission, WHO, Spanish Presidency of the EU, and The Transplantation Society. 5 This called for all states to strive towards self-sufficiency, both by increasing organ donation activity and by efforts to reduce the burden of end-stage organ failure.
The current position in the UK with respect to several of the Guiding Principles is covered elsewhere in this issue; 6–8 this article will comment on relevant issues from the remaining Principles and give international examples and data.
International epidemiology of organ donation and transplantation
For many years, information on donation and transplantation activity in European countries has been published in an annual Council of Europe Transplant Newsletter. 9 Recently, this has been extended to include information from North and South America and Australasia. However, an even more extensive database is the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, 10 established in 2007 under the auspices of the WHO and the Spanish transplant organisation (ONT), which is expected to develop over time to include both activity and outcome data.
Organ donation rates have traditionally been expressed as donors per million of population (pmp). Among the 50 most active countries (in terms of transplantation), some—such as Japan—have relied almost entirely on living donors, while others—such as Spain—on deceased donors. However, in the majority, both forms of donation are practised.
Deceased donation
For many years, Spain has had a donor rate over 30 pmp, and in 2009, it was 34.4 pmp. Portugal is the only other country with a rate >30 pmp, achieved for the first time in 2009. A number of other major countries have donation rates of 20–30 pmp (including France, Italy, and the USA), whereas in the UK, the rate is now 16.4 pmp (Fig. 1 ). The changing deceased donor rates over 10 yr for selected countries are shown in Figure 2. Countries also differ in the extent to which donation after circulatory death (DCD) is practised, with a tendency towards those with lower donation after brain death (DBD) rates to have more active DCD programmes (such as the Netherlands and the UK). It is a current source of speculation as to whether controlled DCD programmes degrade the potential for DBD, or rather whether they are only possible in countries where treatment withdrawal on the grounds of futility dominate end-of-life decision-making.

While expressing the donor rate in population terms is an accurate measure of activity, it may not be the best measure of the effectiveness of the donation system overall. Many factors influence the number of potential donors, and these could include the incidence of life-threatening trauma and intracerebral haemorrhage, the availability of intensive care facilities, the management—through surgery and interventional radiology—of such patients, and the consent rate. There are also legal constraints in a number of countries. If accurate data on the total donor pool were available, a more meaningful measure would be the proportion of possible donors that become actual donors—the so-called conversion rate. In the UK, the Potential Donor Audit is able to provide an estimate of this figure, although there are considerable anxieties about definitions and data accuracy that are currently being addressed. However, one example demonstrates this point. In Spain, there are over 50 pmp patients whose death is confirmed by neurological criteria, whereas in the UK, the rate is 19 pmp. 11
Living donation
Living donation makes a significant contribution to kidney (and to a lesser extent liver) transplantation programmes worldwide and carries a number of advantages. Transplantation becomes elective and can be scheduled to the time the patient needs the transplant. Furthermore, the outcomes are better than if a deceased donor organ is used. However, this is at a cost. The mortality rate for living kidney donors is ∼1:3–5000, 12 while for living liver donors, it may be as high as 1:200. 13 Morbidity occurs in 10–15% of patients and there are the added social and possibly financial costs to the donor. Living donation also opens the opportunity to commercialization and trafficking (see below). Different countries have resolved these issues in different ways, depending at least in part on the availability of deceased donation, and living donor rates vary widely. The Netherlands, Turkey, Norway, and the USA now carry out over 20 pmp living donor kidney transplants per year; in the UK, the figure is 15.9 pmp, whereas in Spain and France, the rate is ∼5 pmp.
Transplant activity
Donation is driven by the needs of patients with end-stage organ failure for transplants, and in this regard, the most important metrics are transplant rates, both in terms of the total number of transplants (from both living and deceased donors) and those for specific organs. Figure 3 shows the transplant activity for the four global regions for which good data are available.

Models to increase the identification and referral of potential donors
Useful comparative metrics for organ donation require clear and agreed definitions, and The Critical Pathway is an important step towards uniform definitions of both the DBD and DCD pathways. 14 The steps being taken to increase organ donation in the UK have been described elsewhere, 15 but there are valuable lessons to be learnt from other countries.
The USA
The National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 1984 established an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the private sector. Since 1986, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has held the federal contract as the OPTN, acting through its 11 regions.
The deceased donor organ donation process can be viewed as a continuum from initial identification of the potential organ donor through to organ transplantation. To maximize the supply and quality of the deceased donor organ pool, every step in this continuum needs to be optimized. Prompt identification of all potential organ donors is critical, and this may be in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit (ICU). Currently, about 90% of actual deceased organ donors in the USA are donors who are declared brain dead (DBD donors) and 10% are donors declared dead after permanent cessation of cardiopulmonary function (DCD donors). Hospitals are required by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to identify and refer all potential organ donors to the local organ procurement organization (OPO). The term ‘imminent death’ has been used to identify those patients who should be referred to the OPO as one of several performance metrics monitored by CMS. To this end, hospitals collaborate with OPOs to organize the identification of imminent deaths, usually by developing explicit, objective clinical criteria for contacting the OPO. One commonly used approach is to consider any ventilator-dependent patient with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5 or less who is expected to die in the hospital as a potential organ donor to be referred to the OPO. This includes patients who are being evaluated for brain death and patients whose families and care team have elected to withdraw support. The impact of decisions to limit or withdraw cardiorespiratory support on the size and nature of the potential donor pool in the USA is unclear and warrants further study.
Australia
Australia has struggled for 20 yr to bring the rate of organ donation up to the level that well-organized developed countries achieve. From 1988 onwards, the Australian approach to organ donation mirrored the national political system—a federal government and state administrations brought together in disconnected, dysfunctional, and unempowered committees. Not surprisingly, the organ donation programme was the result of the voluntary efforts of transplant surgeons and physicians supported by a few dedicated organ donor coordinators with the active participation of a number of intensive care clinicians, but without resources or organizational structure. The outcome was organ donation rates that sank from a high of around 14 pmp in 1989 to eight or nine donors pmp by 2000 as death rates from road trauma and strokes plummeted.
Many people throughout the country came to the understanding that a substantial and significant change would be needed if the benefits of organ transplantation were to be realized for the Australian community. Two processes commenced simultaneously—a grassroots movement involving many prominent community figures on the one hand and a government-sponsored taskforce on the other hand. The report from the taskforce could have languished on a government shelf and a community-driven plan to implement a world's best practice organ donation programme could have fallen on deaf ears, but were instead focused by the newly elected Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. He famously called in his chief health bureaucrats and told them to ‘stop stuffing around’ and fix the organ donation problem in Australia. The plan was an amalgam of the transformative community plan and the researched and widely consultative taskforce plan, funded with 150 million dollars of Federal government money spread over 4 yr. Nine specific programmes were implemented (Table 2 ).

The impact has been considerable. The responsibility for the national organ donation rate lies with the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority, while responsibility to tissue type, cross-match, and transplant lies with the individual State Governments. Organization of the organ donation agencies into a cohesive national organization is the remit of Donatelife, who have developed a network of professional hospital intensivists and nurse specialists and provide reimbursement to meet the hospital costs of care of potential donors, They have also delivered a public media campaign, which has won an international business community award—the Gold Quill Award for social responsibility. Donatelife has also developed national organ allocation protocols, supports the care of donor families, and has developed specific strategies such as a national Donation after Cardiac Death protocol and a national paired kidney exchange programme.
The results are already substantial and the donation rate is climbing (30% in the past year) to the highest ever rate, despite the fact that implementation of the original governmental reform package is far from complete. The principle lessons from the Australian experience include: the powerful motivating voice of the community for creating the political momentum for change; the need for a well thought through and consulted plan of action; national determination stemming from the Prime Minister down; disconnection from the voluntarism of the transplant units working to create change, replaced by the critical role of professional intensive care and organ donation staff; and funding to invest in the National Authority, its network, and its activities.
Spain
The philosophy of the Spanish Model can be summarized as follows:
In Spain, the National Transplant Organization (ONT) was established in 1989 and introduced Transplant Donor Coordinators (TDCs) as an essential component of the so-called Spanish Model of Donation and Transplantation. The majority of TDCs have always been physicians, supported by nurse coordinators. The excellent results of the Spanish Model very much rely on the key role of TDCs. There are three levels of coordination: national, regional, and hospital. TDCs, representing the hospital level of that organizational network, are responsible for enhancing organ donation within their hospitals and are the cornerstone of the system. Initially, TDCs were largely ICU physicians or to a lesser extent nephrologists working part-time as coordinators and part-time in their parent speciality, but an increasing number are now from a nursing background.
95% of all deceased donations in Spain come from brain dead donors, with the remainder being uncontrolled DCD donors. This implies that most potential deceased organ donors are cared for in an ICU, and this is therefore where the efforts to increase donation are targeted.
The main cause of loss of donors is the lack of identification and referral of possible or potential deceased organ donors. If organ donation is not considered when people die under specific circumstances, potential donors will be missed.
The person fundamentally most capable of influencing the process will therefore be a clinician, primarily located in the ICU, who is able to establish an appropriate relationship with those working on the unit, promoting the idea of organ donation as a part of end-of-life care.
The success of the Spanish model is frequently linked to Spain's legal framework of presumed consent. However, the opting-out system for consent to donation was introduced in 1979 and had no impact whatsoever for the 10 yr that followed enactment of the Transplantation Law. Furthermore, the presumed consent policy has never been strictly applied in practice; relatives are always approached and always have the final say. Only with the establishment of ONT and the introduction of TDCs did donation rates begin to rise, with this being attributable to the skill of the very well-trained transplant coordinators who approach the grieving families. It is notable that the consent rates for foreign nationals living in Spain (coming from other parts of Europe, Latin-America, Asia or Africa) match those of the indigenous population.
A further essential component of the Spanish Model is the Quality Assurance Programme, as a tool to define and monitor the potential of deceased organ donation and evaluate areas where improvement is possible. An important element of this is an external evaluation, where external observers (who are also TDCs) provide peer-review evaluation of the processes supporting organ donation in individual institutions. Finally, the TDCs in Spain neither depend on, nor report to, the head of the transplant team. The ONT recommendation was quite clear from the very beginning: the TDC should directly report to the medical director of the hospital and should have a major role in promoting organ donation among all health-care and non-health-care professionals. A positive attitude of the entire hospital towards donation is essential to be sure that the process works adequately.
Payment for organs and transplant tourism
In 2004, the World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a resolution that urged member states ‘to take measures to protect the poorest and vulnerable groups from transplant tourism and the sale of tissues and organs, including attention to the wider problem of international trafficking in human tissues and organs’. 16 As of 2007, the WHO estimated that 10% of organ transplants performed worldwide involved these unacceptable activities.
To address the concerns of the WHA and the growing problem of organ sales, a Summit Meeting of more than 150 international representatives of scientific and medical bodies, government officials, social scientists, and ethicists was held in Istanbul, Turkey, from April 30 to May 2, 2008. The result of these deliberations was the Istanbul Declaration on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism.4 The Declaration of Istanbul calls for a prohibition of organ trafficking, transplant commercialism, and transplant tourism: ‘because transplant commercialism or the buying and selling of organs targets impoverished and otherwise vulnerable donors it inexorably leads to inequity and injustice and should be prohibited. The vulnerable donors are minors, illiterate and impoverished persons, undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and political or economic refugees’.
The definition of transplant tourism
Travel for transplantation is the movement of organs, donors, recipients, or transplant professionals across jurisdictional borders for transplantation purposes. Travel for transplantation becomes ‘transplant tourism’ if it involves organ trafficking, transplant commercialism, or both or if the resources (organs, professionals, and transplant centres) devoted to providing transplants to patients from outside a country undermine the country's ability to provide transplant services for its own population. Transplant tourism is different from medical tourism for other kinds of medical care because it involves a live donor, whose interests and well-being must be considered just as important as those of the recipient. The medical resource used in transplant tourism is an exploited live donor. Vulnerable populations (such as those defined above) in resource-poor and underdeveloped countries have become a major source of organs for so-called ‘transplant tourists’ who can afford to travel and purchase organs. 17
Acceptable travel for transplantation
Not all recipients travel to a foreign country to undergo transplantation is unethical. Travel for transplantation may be acceptable if the following conditions are fulfilled:
For transplantation from a live donor:
For transplantation from a deceased donor:
if the recipient has a dual citizenship (in the country of residence and also in the destination country) and wishes to undergo transplantation from a live donor who is a family member in the destination country of citizenship that is not their residence.
if the donor and recipient are genetically or emotionally related and wish to undergo donation and transplantation in a country not of their residence to gain access to better health services.
if official regulated bilateral or multilateral organ-sharing programmes exist between or among jurisdictions (countries) that are based on reciprocal organ-sharing programmes between or among the jurisdictions.
Consequences of transplant tourism
Transplant tourists prevent deceased donor organs from being available for the people of the destination country because the rich tourists who pay for the organs receive preferential care. In addition, transplant tourists impede the development of deceased or altruistic live donation that otherwise would develop in the client country. If the insurance companies of a country preferentially send patients to the Philippines or Pakistan for organs because the transplant will cost less with a meagre payment to the organ vendor, deceased donation and altruistic living-related donation (in the country that the tourist resides) are affected by that systematic approach to use the poor of the destination country as the source of organs.
Quality and safety
All transplanted human organs carry potential risks to the recipient, either from unsatisfactory organ function or disease transmission from the donor to the recipient, with malignancy and infectious diseases being the most relevant. In the case of living donors, there are also the risks to the donor, both immediate and longer term. A knowledge of these risks is a pre-requisite for consent. However, for some recipients—faced with imminent death without a transplant—even significant risks associated with a specific organ or its donor may be acceptable and better than the alternative of imminent death. From the recipient's point of view, it is therefore important to approach quality and safety in terms of the risk–benefit balance rather than by attempting to eradicate risk entirely.
The European Commission has recently published a binding Directive on the Quality and Safety of Human Organs for Transplantation, 18 with implementation by all member states required by August 2012. The Directive requires member states to establish and maintain a framework for quality and safety that covers all stages of the chain from donation to transplantation, and to identify a Competent Authority with responsibility to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of the various Articles of the Directive. In the UK, the Human Tissue Authority is now the Competent Authority, although it is able to delegate some areas of its responsibility to other statutory bodies, principally NHS Blood and Transplant. The stages covered by the various Articles are:
Furthermore, it is required that:
verification of donor identity;
verification of the details of the donor's or the donor's family consent;
verification of the completion of organ and donor characterization in accordance with specified criteria;
the procurement, preservation, packaging, and labelling of organs;
the transportation of organs;
the reporting of serious adverse events and reactions at any stage of the pathway.
‘All healthcare personnel involved in the entire process are suitably qualified, procurement must take place in suitable operating theatres, donor selection and evaluation must be performed under the advice and assistance of a doctor of medicine, medical teams shall endeavour to obtain the required information from relatives of the deceased donor or other persons, and tests for organ and donor characterisation must be carried out by laboratories with suitably qualified personnel and adequate facilities and equipment'.
‘The Competent Authority must
There will be a certain impact on Specialist Nurses for Organ Donation, retrieval teams, organ transport arrangements, and transplant centres—if only in their need to be licensed by the Competent Authority—but the impact on those who care for potential organ donors (i.e. critical care teams) is likely to be negligible. Moreover, the Directive explicitly acknowledges that it is impossible to eliminate risk altogether and that a risk–benefit analysis (even when relevant information cannot be obtained) should allow transplantation to proceed whenever it is appropriate.
licence procurement organisations and transplantation centres,
keep a record of the activities of procurement organisations and transplantation centres,
issue appropriate guidance to healthcare establishments, professionals and other parties,
establish a reporting system for serious adverse events and reactions,
put in place a traceability system,
ensure that appropriate organ and donor characterisation reaches the transplantation centre in due time’.
Transparency and the role of registries in providing data on donation and transplantation activity and outcomes
The commentary on the EU Directive states: ‘Transparency can be summarized as maintaining public access to regularly updated comprehensive data on allocation, transplant activities and outcomes for both recipients and living donors’. Many, but not all, countries with active donation and transplantation have a national—or supra-national—registry. The principal registries include the UK Transplant Registry held by NHSBT, the United Network for Organ Sharing and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in the USA, and the ANZDATA registry in Australia and New Zealand. The Collaborative Transplant Study is one of the largest transplant registries, with patient-level data from over 300 transplant centres worldwide.
Comprehensive data collection, storage, and analysis are a significant undertaking, but offer several important benefits. They allow the generation of a comprehensive overview of donation and transplantation activity and support the development of evidence-based practice (particularly with regard to organ allocation and transplant outcomes). They facilitate dissemination of learning regarding experience with rare diseases and complications and allow recipients of high-risk organs to be tracked should subsequent follow-up be required. Registry data make an important contribution to the monitoring and comparison of individual centres, help ensure equity of access to transplantation, and allow organs to be matched to highly sensitized individuals as effectively as possible.
The quality of registry data is important and involves steps to ensure that complete and accurate data are available, with suitable arrangements for data validation. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of both the strengths and the weaknesses of registry data. Registries provide retrospective observational data with the potential for selection bias, missing data, and incomplete coverage. Furthermore, registry data may not be as detailed as the records at an individual centre. In contrast, although prospectively collected clinical trials data may allow a more robust comparison between different treatments or interventions, the sample size requirements are often prohibitive. In reality, registries play a significant role in providing the evidence base for the development of transplant practice, benefit patients through monitoring of allocation and transplant outcomes, and provide transparency to the entire pathway from donation to transplantation.
Conclusion
Organ transplantation is unique—a patient can only become the recipient of a transplant because another human has donated the organ, either in life or after death. The dramatic clinical benefits of transplantation (emphasized by the remarkably good outcomes that are now achieved, at least in the short-to-medium term) are, however, not available to all who would benefit. The pressure to increase the number of organs available is felt worldwide, and many countries have introduced systematic programmes to increase donation. Regrettably, in some areas, practices have developed that have gone beyond the limits of ethical and legal acceptability and there has been intense activity—led by both political and professional organizations—to define practice that has a firm legal and ethical basis, which tries to maximize quality and safety. There is a strong movement encouraging all countries and regions of the world to work towards self-sufficiency, with as much emphasis on disease reduction as on increasing donation. Within these frameworks, there remains a great deal to be done to respond to the donor shortage and to offer the chance of a transplant to as many patients as possible.
