As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and insights based on data and research. Regarding the question of whether the required infrastructure for sales promotion exists in every country, it's important to consider various factors such as economic development, technological advancement, regulatory environment, and cultural practices.

Firstly, infrastructure for sales promotion can encompass a wide range of elements, including physical infrastructure like transportation networks, storage facilities, and distribution centers, as well as digital infrastructure such as internet connectivity, e-commerce platforms, and marketing tools. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in facilitating or hindering sales promotion activities.

In more developed countries, there is often a robust infrastructure in place that supports efficient sales promotion. These countries typically have well-established transportation systems, advanced technology infrastructure, and business-friendly regulations. For example, in the United States, there is a extensive network of highways, airports, and seaports, which facilitate the movement of goods across the country and internationally. Moreover, the widespread availability of high-speed internet and the prevalence of e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay have revolutionized the way products are promoted and sold.

However, in less developed or developing countries, the infrastructure for sales promotion may be less完善. Physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, and logistics networks might be inadequate, leading to higher transportation costs and longer delivery times. Furthermore, limited access to reliable electricity and poor internet connectivity can hinder the adoption of digital sales promotion methods. Regulatory environments in some countries may also pose challenges, with complex bureaucratic procedures, high taxes, or restrictive trade policies that can discourage businesses from engaging in sales promotion activities.

That being said, it's essential to recognize that even in countries with less developed infrastructure, there are often alternative approaches to sales promotion that leverage local resources and capabilities. For instance, in regions with limited internet access, traditional marketing methods such as word-of-mouth, local events, and print media may still be effective. Additionally, many developing countries are making significant investments in improving their infrastructure to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth.

In conclusion, while the required infrastructure for sales promotion may not be uniformly present in every country, the specific circumstances and available resources in each nation shape the approaches and strategies used for sales promotion. Businesses operating in different markets need to adapt their sales promotion tactics to align with the local infrastructure and cultural norms.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, the required infrastructure for sales promotion does not exist uniformly in every country.}} \]
