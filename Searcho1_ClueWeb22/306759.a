So I need to figure out the short-term and long-term causes of World War I. I don't remember a lot about this, but I know it's a really important topic in history. Maybe I should start by understanding what short-term and long-term causes mean in this context.

I think short-term causes are the immediate events that triggered the war, like maybe a specific incident or a series of events that happened right before the war started. On the other hand, long-term causes are the underlying tensions and issues that had been building up over time and made the outbreak of war more likely.

Alright, so for World War I, I recall that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was a key event. I think that's probably one of the short-term causes. Let me see if I can find more information about that.

ASSASSINATION OF ARCHDUKE FERDINAND FACTS
WORLD WAR ONE FACTS
Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand Facts
The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, in June of 1914 led directly to the outbreak of World War One. Although there were many causes of World War One this assassination, as most kids have read in their history books, was the spark that led to hostilities. Below are a list of interesting facts about this event including when the assassination occurred, where the Archduke was assassinated, and how it led to the outbreak of WW1.

Background to the Assassination
By June of 1914 Europe had become a powder keg due to tensions between the major military powers; it was a situation just waiting for a spark to ignite it. Read 

about how Europe got into this situation on  
our World War One Causes page; for an explanation of the major 

causes.
The 1908 annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire enraged many Serbs and led to the formation of groups such as Young Bosnia.
The 28th of June, the day of the assassination, was Serbia's National Day and it was insulting to most Serbs to have Franz Ferdinand visit Sarajevo on that 

day.
Facts about the Assassination of the Archduke
Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June 28th, 1914 in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo.
The Archduke's wife Sophie was also killed during the assassination.
A group of seven Bosnian Serbs planned to kill the Archduke as his motorcade travelled down the Appel Quay; the main road in Sarajevo. Several of them positioned 

themselves along the route.
The assassin was Gavrilo Princip a Serb nationalist who was a member of a group called Young Bosnia. This group was angered by the 1908 annexation of Bosnia-

Herzegovina by the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
There were two attempts on the Archduke's life on the day he was killed; both by members of the group called Young Bosnia. The first attempt was made by Nedeljko 

Cabrinovic. He threw a bomb at Ferdinand's  
car as the royal motorcade passed by him. The bomb was deflected and exploded away from its target injuring several onlookers.
Like the other would be assassins Gavrilo Princip had positioned himself along the Appel Quay (the main street in Sarajevo). After the first attempt at the 

assassination failed the Archdukes car travelled  
past Princip to quickly for him to attempt to kill the Archduke. He walked to nearby Franz Joseph Street where later the Archduke's car would make a wrong turn and 

stop right in front of him.
Archduke Ferdinand was shot at close range by Gavrilo Princip. He was hit in the throat and his wife was hit in the stomach. Both died minutes after the 

shooting.
Perhaps due to the historical significance of the assassination the killing of the Archduke and his wife is often not described at a human level. This was a 

horrific event. As Archduke Ferdinand was bleeding  
to death from the wound to his neck he begged his wife, who lied mortally wounded on his lap, to stay alive for the sake of their children.
Aftermath of the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
Following the assassination a series of diplomatic events took place that would lead to the Austro-Hungarian Empire declaring war on Serbia. This in turn would 

lead to all the major military powers in Europe  
becoming involved due to pre-established alliances.
The assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was 19 years old at the time of the assassination; too young to legally receive the death penalty; he was sentenced to 20 years in 

prison. He would die in prison from  
tuberculosis in 1918.
Several of the participants in the conspiracy were executed while others received jail sentences of various lengths.

World War I: Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand
History >> World War I
World War I
Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand
The assassination of Austria's Archduke Ferdinand set into motion a series of international events that led to World War I. This one event is widely considered the most important event in leading up to war.

Who was Archduke Ferdinand?
Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in the city of Graz on December 18, 1863. After his cousin and father died, he became the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. His uncle, Franz Joseph, was the current emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. He was married to Sophie, the Duchess of Hohenberg.
Leading up to the Assassination
In the southern portion of Austria-Hungary was a region called Bosnia. Many of the Bosnians wanted to have their own country and not be under the rule of Austria-Hungary. The country of Serbia, just south of the Austria-Hungary border also wanted the freedom of the Bosnians. Serbia was an ally with the powerful Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary was allied with Germany.
When Archduke Ferdinand announced his trip to Sarajevo, Bosnian nationalists (people who wanted Bosnia to be its own country) saw their opportunity to strike at the Austrian Empire. With help from the neighboring country of Serbia, assassins were recruited and trained to kill the Archduke as he traveled through the streets of Sarajevo. These assassins were members of a terrorist group called the Black Hand.
The Assassination
On June 28, 1914 Franz Ferdinand and his wife were in the third car of a motorcade traveling through Sarajevo to the Town Hall. The Black Hand had several assassins positioned along the route.
On the way to the Town Hall, the first assassination attempt occurred. A man named Nedeljko Cabrinovic threw a bomb into the car with the Archduke. However, the bomb bounced off the car and landed under the next car in the motorcade. The car with the Archduke was able to speed away and make it safely to the Town Hall.
The assassins did not give up, however. On the return trip, the motorcade took a wrong turn. When the driver began to back up, another assassin named Gavrilo Princip happened to be right next to the car. He took advantage of this opportunity and began firing at the Archduke. He fired twice, hitting the Archduke once and his wife Sophie.
The crowd jumped on Princip and he was arrested by the police. At the same time the car sped to the Governor's residence to get medical help. Unfortunately, Sophie was dead before they arrived and the Archduke died a few minutes later.
Results and Why it Started WW1
The Austria-Hungary government saw the assassination as a direct attack on the country. They believed that the Serbians had helped the Bosnian terrorists in the attack. They made harsh demands on the Serbians which the Serbians rejected. At the same time, Russia began to mobilize their army to help protect Serbia. When Serbia rejected the demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. A few days later, Germany declared war on Russia to help its ally Austria-Hungary. Then France began to mobilize to help its ally Russia, and Germany followed by declaring war on France. World War I had begun.
Interesting Facts about the Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand
When Ferdinand saw that his wife was shot he exclaimed "Sophie! Don't die! Stay alive for the children!"
Both Princip and Cabrinovic tried to kill themselves with cyanide pills, but the pills only made them very sick.
Between the bomb and the shooting, Ferdinand attended a ceremony given by the Major of Sarajevo at City Hall.
The Serbian Prime Minister learned of the assassination attempt prior to the attack. He tried to warn the Austrians, but his warning was so vague that the Austrians did not understand how real the threat was.

Archduke Franz Ferdinand Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria [a] (18 December 1863 – 28 June 1914) was the heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary.[1] His assassination in Sarajevo was the most immediate cause of World War I .
Franz Ferdinand was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Following the death of Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the death of Karl Ludwig in 1896, Franz Ferdinand became the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. His courtship of Sophie Chotek, a lady-in-waiting, caused conflict within the imperial household, and their morganatic marriage in 1900 was only allowed after he renounced his descendants' rights to the throne. Franz Ferdinand held significant influence over the military, and in 1913 he was appointed inspector general of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces.
On 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo by the 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia. Franz Ferdinand's assassination led to the July Crisis and precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia, which in turn triggered a series of events that eventually led to Austria-Hungary's allies and Serbia's allies declaring war on each other, starting World War I.

Early life
Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz, Austria, the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (the younger brother of Franz Joseph and Maximilian) and of his second wife, Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. In 1875, when he was eleven years old, his cousin Francis V, Duke of Modena, died, naming Franz Ferdinand his heir on condition that he add the name "Este" to his own. Franz Ferdinand thus became one of the wealthiest men in Austria.[citation needed]
Heir presumptive
In 1889, Franz Ferdinand's life changed dramatically.  His cousin Crown Prince Rudolf committed suicide at his hunting lodge in Mayerling.[5] This left Franz Ferdinand's father, Karl Ludwig, as first in line to the throne. Karl Ludwig died of typhoid fever in 1896. [6] Henceforth, Franz Ferdinand was groomed to succeed to the throne.[citation needed]
Travels

Despite this burden, he did manage to find time for travel and personal pursuits, such as his circumnavigation of the world between 1892 and 1893. After visiting India he spent time  hunting kangaroos and emus in Australia in 1893, [7] then travelled on to Nouméa, New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Sarawak, Hong Kong and Japan. [8] After sailing across the Pacific on the RMS Empress of China from Yokohama to Vancouver [9] he crossed the United States, arriving at the World's Columbian Exposition 1893 on the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad on a private Pullman car named Mascotte, [10] and staying at the Lexington Hotel,[11] before continuing through to New York and returning to Europe.
The Archduke and his wife visited England in the autumn of 1913, spending a week with George V and Queen Mary at Windsor Castle before going to stay for another week with the Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, where they arrived on 22 November. He attended a service at the local Catholic church in Worksop and the Duke and Archduke went game shooting on the Welbeck estate when, according to the Duke's memoirs, Men, Women and Things :
One of the loaders fell down. This caused both barrels of the gun he was carrying to be discharged, the shot passing within a few feet of the archduke and myself. I have often wondered whether the Great War might not have been averted, or at least postponed, had the archduke met his death there and not in Sarajevo the following year. [12]
Franz Ferdinand had a fondness for trophy hunting that was excessive even by the standards of European nobility of this time. [13] In his diaries he kept track of 272,511 game kills, [14] 5,000 of which were deer. About 100,000 trophies were on exhibit at his Bohemian castle at Konopiště [15] [16] which he also stuffed with various antiquities, his other great passion. [17]
Military career
Franz Ferdinand, like most males in the ruling Habsburg line, entered the Austro-Hungarian Army at a young age.  He was frequently and rapidly promoted, given the rank of lieutenant at age fourteen, captain at twenty-two, colonel at twenty-seven, and major general at thirty-one. [18] While never receiving formal staff training, he was considered eligible for command and at one point briefly led the primarily Hungarian 9th Hussar Regiment. [19] In 1898 he was given a commission "at the special disposition of His Majesty" to make inquiries into all aspects of the military services and military agencies were commanded to share their papers with him. [20]
He also held honorary ranks in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and received the rank of Admiral at the close of the Austro-Hungarian naval maneuvers in September 1902. [21]
Franz Ferdinand exerted influence on the armed forces even when he did not hold a specific command through a military chancery that produced and received documents and papers on military affairs. This was headed by Alexander Brosch von Aarenau and eventually employed a staff of sixteen. [20] His authority was reinforced in 1907 when he secured the retirement of the Emperor's confidant Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky as Chief of the General Staff. Beck's successor, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, was personally selected by Franz Ferdinand. [22]
Franz in 1913, as heir-presumptive to the elderly emperor, had been appointed inspector general of all the armed forces of Austria-Hungary (Generalinspektor der gesamten bewaffneten Macht ), a position superior to that previously held by Archduke Albrecht and including presumed command in wartime. [23]
Marriage and family

In 1894, Franz Ferdinand met Countess Sophie Chotek, a lady-in-waiting to Archduchess Isabella, wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen.[24] Franz began to visit Archduke Friedrich's villa in Pressburg (now Bratislava ), and in turn Sophie wrote to Franz Ferdinand during his convalescence from tuberculosis on the island of Lošinj in the Adriatic. They kept their relationship a secret, [25] until it was discovered by Isabella herself.
To be eligible to marry a member of the imperial House of Habsburg, one had to be a member of one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. The Choteks were not one of these families. Deeply in love, Franz Ferdinand refused to consider marrying anyone else. Finally, in 1899, Emperor Franz Joseph agreed to permit Franz Ferdinand to marry Sophie, on the condition that the marriage would be morganatic and that their descendants would not have succession rights to the throne. [5] Sophie would not share her husband's rank, title, precedence, or privileges; as such, she would not normally appear in public beside him. She would not be allowed to ride in the royal carriage or sit in the royal box in theaters. [25]
The wedding took place on 1 July 1900, at Reichstadt (now Zákupy) in Bohemia; Franz Joseph did not attend the affair, nor did any archduke including Franz Ferdinand's brothers. [5] The only members of the imperial family who were present were Franz Ferdinand's stepmother, Princess Maria Theresa of Braganza; and her two daughters. Upon the marriage, Sophie was given the title "Princess of Hohenberg" (Fürstin von Hohenberg) with the style "Her Serene Highness" (Ihre Durchlaucht ).  In 1909, she was given the more senior title "Duchess of Hohenberg" (Herzogin von Hohenberg) with the style "Her Highness" (Ihre Hoheit ). This raised her status considerably, but she still yielded precedence at court to all the archduchesses. Whenever a function required the couple to assemble with the other members of the imperial family, Sophie was forced to stand far down the line, separated from her husband. [25]
Franz Ferdinand's children were:
Princess Sophie of Hohenberg (1901–1990), married Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck (1891–1973)
Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg (1902–1962), married Countess Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (1904–1993)
Prince Ernst of Hohenberg (1904–1954), married Marie-Therese Wood (1910–1985)
Stillborn son (1908), buried in Artstetten Castle, near his parents [26] [27]
Character
The German historian Michael Freund described Franz Ferdinand as "a man of uninspired energy, dark in appearance and emotion, who radiated an aura of strangeness and cast a shadow of violence and recklessness ... a true personality amidst the amiable inanity that characterized Austrian society at this time." [28] As his sometime admirer Karl Kraus put it, "he was not one who would greet you ... he felt no compulsion to reach out for the unexplored region which the Viennese call their heart." [29] His relations with Emperor Franz Joseph were tense; the emperor's personal servant recalled in his memoirs that "thunder and lightning always raged when they had their discussions." [30] The commentaries and orders which the heir to the throne wrote as margin notes to the documents of the Imperial central commission for architectural conservation (where he was Protector) reveal what can be described as "choleric conservatism." [31] The Italian historian Leo Valiani provided the following description.
Francis Ferdinand was a prince of absolutist inclinations, but he had certain intellectual gifts and undoubted moral earnestness. One of his projects – though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed – was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to diminish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848–49 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti (de), Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and – with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years – again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to Berchtold, the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, the Archduke said that "irredentism in our country ... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life" instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation. [32]
Political views
Map of the federalization of Austria-Hungary planned by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the member states with separate governments
Historians have disagreed on how to characterize the political philosophies of Franz Ferdinand, some attributing generally liberal views on the empire's nationalities while others have emphasized his dynastic centralism, Catholic conservatism, and tendency to clash with other leaders. [18] He advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the Empire and addressing their grievances, especially the Czechs in Bohemia and the south Slavic peoples in Croatia and Bosnia, who had been left out of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.[33] Yet his feelings towards the Hungarians were less generous, often described as antipathy. For example, in 1904 he wrote that "The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary", and he regarded even István Tisza as a revolutionary and "patented traitor". [34] He regarded Hungarian nationalism as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence – despite the fact that it was the official regimental language. [19] He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the Honvédség, as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army [35] and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces. [36]
He also advocated a cautious approach towards Serbia – repeatedly locking horns with Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, Vienna's hard-line Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with Russia, to the ruin of both empires.[citation needed]
He was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a great power, such as during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Other nations, including, in his description, "dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal", [22] had soldiers stationed in China, but Austria-Hungary did not. However, Austria-Hungary did participate in the Eight-Nation Alliance to suppress the Boxers, and sent soldiers as part of the "international relief force".
Franz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known or supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a lying in state aboard SMS Viribus Unitis .
Assassination
Main article: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
As described by contemporary Spanish magazine El Mundo Gráfico: "The moment when the Austrian archdukes, following the first attempt against their lives, arrived at the City Council (of Sarajevo), where they were received by the mayor and the municipal corporation."

The Latin Bridge near the assassination site
On Sunday, 28 June 1914, at about 10:45 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The perpetrator was 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia and one of a group of assassins organized and armed by the Black Hand.[4]
Earlier in the day, the couple had been attacked by Nedeljko Čabrinović, who had thrown a grenade at their car. However, the bomb detonated behind them, injuring the occupants in the following car. On arriving at the Governor's residence, Franz angrily shouted, "So this is how you welcome your guests – with bombs!" [37]
After a short rest at the Governor's residence, the royal couple insisted on seeing all those who had been injured by the bomb at the local hospital. However, no one told the drivers that the itinerary had been changed. When the error was discovered, the drivers had to turn around. As the cars backed down the street and onto a side street, the line of cars stalled. At this same time, Princip was sitting at a cafe across the street. He instantly seized his opportunity and walked across the street and shot the royal couple. [37] He first shot Sophie in the abdomen and then shot Franz Ferdinand in the neck. Franz leaned over his crying wife. He was still alive when witnesses arrived to render aid. [4] His dying words to Sophie were, "Don't die darling, live for our children." [37] Princip's weapon was the pocket-sized FN Model 1910 pistol chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge provided him by Serbian Army Colonel and Black Hand member Dragutin Dimitrijević.[38] The archduke's aides attempted to undo his coat but realized they needed scissors to cut it open:  the outer lapel had been sewn to the inner front of the jacket for a smoother fit to improve the Archduke's appearance to the public.  Whether or not as a result of this obstacle, the Archduke's wound could not be attended to in time to save him, and he died within minutes. Sophie also died en route to the hospital. [39]
A detailed account of the shooting can be found in Sarajevo by Joachim Remak: [40]
One bullet pierced Franz Ferdinand's neck while the other pierced Sophie's abdomen. ... As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The Duchess, seeing this, called: "For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees.
Harrach and Potoriek ... thought she had fainted ... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening. Turning to his wife despite the bullet in his neck, Franz Ferdinand pleaded: "Sopherl! Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am Leben für unsere Kinder! – Sophie dear! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!" Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat ... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked "Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr? – Is Your Imperial Highness suffering very badly?"  "Es ist nichts. – It is nothing." said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more.
A rattle began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall).
Despite several doctors' efforts, the Archduke died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.
The assassinations, along with the arms race, nationalism, imperialism, militarism of Imperial Germany and the alliance system all contributed to the origins of World War I, which began a month after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. [41] The assassination of Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War I. [42]
After his death, Archduke Karl became the Heir presumptive of Austria-Hungary.
Franz Ferdinand is interred with his wife Sophie in Artstetten Castle, Austria.

Austria's Archduke Ferdinand assassinated - HISTORY
1914
June 28
Austria's Archduke Ferdinand assassinated
Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie are shot to death by a Bosnian Serb nationalist during an official visit to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. The killings sparked a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I by early August. On June 28, 1919, five years to the day after Franz Ferdinand’s death, Germany and the Allied Powers signed the Treaty of Versailles, officially marking the end of World War I.
READ MORE: Did Franz Ferdinand’s Assassination Cause World War I?
The archduke traveled to Sarajevo in June 1914 to inspect the imperial armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908. The annexation had angered Serbian nationalists, who believed the territories should be part of Serbia. A group of young nationalists hatched a plot to kill the archduke during his visit to Sarajevo, and after some missteps, 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip was able to shoot the royal couple at point-blank range, while they traveled in their official procession, killing both almost instantly.
The assassination set off a rapid chain of events, as Austria-Hungary immediately blamed the Serbian government for the attack. As large and powerful Russia supported Serbia, Austria asked for assurances that Germany would step in on its side against Russia and its allies, including France and possibly Great Britain. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the fragile peace between Europe’s great powers collapsed, beginning the devastating conflict now known as the First World War.
READ MORE: US Entry into World War I
After more than four years of bloodshed, the Great War ended on November 11, 1918, after Germany, the last of the Central Powers, surrendered to the Allies. At the peace conference in Paris in 1919, Allied leaders would state their desire to build a post-war world that was safe from future wars of such enormous scale. The Versailles Treaty, signed on June 28, 1919, tragically failed to achieve this objective. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ’s grand dreams of an international peace-keeping organization faltered when put into practice as the League of Nations. Even worse, the harsh terms imposed on Germany, the war’s biggest loser, led to widespread resentment of the treaty and its authors in that country—a resentment that would culminate in the outbreak of the Second World War two decades later.

The Franz Ferdinand Assassination: A Catalyst for World War One
Written by Tom Matthews
Last Updated on 3rd November 2021
The murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, is a major historical event that shocked the world. The Franz Ferdinand assassination took place in June 1914 and was carried out by a Bosnian-Serb and radicalist named Gavrilo Princip. The catastrophic event reveals a lot about the political and social tensions that characterised the beginning of the 20th century. This single assassination set in motion a domino effect of events which would inevitably lead to the outbreak of World War I.
Why was Franz Ferdinand assassinated? What happened on the morning of the assassination? And what reasoning is there to say that this singular event was the cause of World War I? In this post we will discuss each of these questions and provide a detailed insight into the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and how the event was connected to the inception of World War I.

Why Was Franz Ferdinand Murdered?
To understand why the death of Franz Ferdinand took place on 28th June 1914, we must first understand the historical and political context of the time in which the incident occurred.
The early 20th century was a tumultuous time for Eastern Europe, where empires fought for control of the Balkan countries and the people suffered as a result. The Bosnian Crisis of 1908 saw Bosnia and Herzegovina annexed from Austro-Hungary. Bosnia and Herzegovina were still formally provinces of the Ottoman Empire, who had controlled them in the past. Austria-Hungary had attempted to improve the valuable region economically, and to tie it to Austria-Hungary. July 1908 saw the Young Turks staging a revolution in Constantinople (Istanbul). During this revolution they commenced a reform program, and as a result Austria-Hungary decided to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina before the Turkish regime managed to gain control of the provinces.
Serbia wasn’t at all happy about Austria-Hungary’s decision. Serbia was close to Bosnia and Herzegovina both geographically and ethnically. The provinces were home to a huge Serbian population, and the annexation caused outrage among Serbian nationalists. Serbia demanded that Austria-Hungary give them a portion of Bosnia at least, and Austria, with support from Russia, declined and threatened Serbia with invasion if the demands continued to persist.
So what did unsuspecting Archduke Franz Ferdinand have to do with it all?

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, and he had opposed the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina because he believed it would worsen the turbulent political situation. Ferdinand had voiced his thoughts about Serbian people, using an unpleasant vocabulary filled with words like “pigs”, “thieves” and “murderers”.
Upon hearing that the Archduke and heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire was to visit Sarajevo, a group of young Bosnian student revolutionaries known as the Young Bosnians began hatching a plot to assassinate him. If it worked, this would act as a message and a threat to the Austro-Hungarian government. The turbulent political situation and bitter relations resulted in the tensions materialising in underground radical movements.
Since Serbia won the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 it had become a source of frustration for Austria-Hungary. Serbia had doubled its territory and increased its population by 1.5 million since the Balkan wars, and its aim was to unite further territory and people with the Kingdom of Serbia. The people were angry, and the extreme nationalists took this opportunity to voice that anger through an act of terrorism.

How The Murder of Franz Ferdinand Unfolded
The Young Bosnians were a group of radical nationalists from Bosnia who planned the attack on the Archduke. Once their plan was in place, three members Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabez and Nedeljko Cabrinovic made their way to Belgrade where they obtained six handheld bombs, four pistols and cyanide capsules which they would use to commit suicide after the attack. They received these items from a terrorist group called the Black Hand, which held close ties with the Serbian army. Then, the men travelled back to Bosnia and Herzegovina, helped by the Black Hand to smuggle their weapons across the border.
The plan was in motion, and the world had no idea.

The story of Franz Ferdinand’s assassination begins on the morning of June 28th 1914, when the Archduke and his wife Sophie arrived at the train station in Sarajevo. Ferdinand had come to inspect the Austrian imperial armed forces, despite being warned that potential danger awaited him in the capital in the form of a radical Serbian nationalist organisation.
As the couple travelled from the train station to the town hall by car, the first attack occurred. Nedeljko Cabrinovic, a conspirator, threw a bomb at the car. However, it bounced off and exploded underneath the car following behind, injuring a few passengers. The first assassination attempt was unsuccessful. The conspirators disbanded, thinking their opportunity had passed.
Little did they, or anyone, know that the consequences of a small change of plan was going to set in motion a series of events that would change the fate of the world forever.
After the first assassination attempt, the Archduke and Sophie were due to start making their way home. It wasn’t safe for them in Sarajevo, and they were advised to take a different route than previously planned to avoid any more danger awaiting them. However, the driver wasn’t informed of this change of plan. As they were making their way down Franz Josef Strasse, the street they were meant to avoid, the driver realised his mistake and quickly manoeuvred the car to turn back the way they came.
Meanwhile, the young Bosnian Gavrilo Princip was returning home, disappointed and discouraged after the failed assassination. As the driver tried to turn the car, it came to stop right in front of the place where none other than Gavrilo Princip stood.

Princip saw his window, quickly drew his pistol and shot the Archduke point blank in the throat. After a small struggle, he shot Sophie in the stomach. Both were pronounced dead before 11 AM. Princip attempted to commit suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule, this failed, and instead he was detained. As Princip was only 19 years old he escaped the death penalty, and was instead sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Less than 4 years after the assassination, Princip died from tuberculosis in prison. The harsh and unsanitary prison conditions had been worsened by the war, and Princip spent his last years sickly and even had to have his arms amputated.
After the assassination, Princip’s reputation lay somewhere on the spectrum between “terrorist” and “national hero”. In Yugoslavia he was revered as a martyr, and had bridges and museums dedicated to him. His grave in Sarajevo became a pilgrimage site, and a plaque for him reads “Here in this historical place, Gavrilo Princip was the instigator of liberty, on the day of St. Vitus, the 28th of June, 1914.”

A Catalyst for World War One
The beginning of the 20th century saw many assassinations and assassination attempts of major political figures on the continent; but what assassination started World War One, or at least set in motion the events that would trigger it?
The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the falling domino which set into motion a series of events which would eventuate in the outbreak of World War One. It is widely acknowledged that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the cause of World War One, or at least one of the major events that sparked it.

It is debatable whether or not World War One can be traced back to a single event, but many historians agree that this was one of the main catalysts which would affect the decisions made by politicians and leaders, and ultimately result in the war beginning one month later. So, how did the assassination of Ferdinand start World War One?
When news spread throughout Europe about the assassination of the Archduke, the general reaction was that of horror and disdain. Ferdinand himself was not exactly the most popular fellow, but his assassination wasn’t seen as a personal attack, rather an attack on the country as a whole.
Following the assassination, the Austro-Hungarian government saw the event as a direct attack on the country. Austria immediately blamed the Serbian government, thinking that they must have instigated the attack, and began to plot ways to seek revenge for what had occurred.
A week after the assassination, the Austrian government then turned to Germany to ask for their support if a war were to break out with Russia, which backed Serbia at the time. Germany agreed to this, and promised Austria their alliance whatever happened. Austria was reassured that they would have Germany’s full support, even if ultimately their actions would result in a world war.
On July 23rd, the Austrian government sent an ultimatum to Serbia. The ultimatum demanded that Serbia admit to being behind the plot to assassinate Ferdinand and being aware of subversive movement within the country. Additionally, it demanded that Belgrade would have to accept the annexation of Bosnia, and issue a formal apology to the press. In reality, Austria was expecting war all along, and it has been said that this ultimatum was simply proposed for appearances sake.
On July 25th Serbia agreed to this ultimatum on one condition, which was that Austrian police would not be granted entry into Serbia. Within 48 hours, Austria had broken all diplomatic relations with Serbia and declared war on the 28th July.
World War One had begun.
Once Austria declared war on Serbia, alliances had to be formed with the other European countries. Germany rallied behind Austria against Russia, and Britain and France found themselves in a complex situation facing an extremely difficult decision. Britain’s dilemma was that if Russia won the war without their support there would be grave consequences. However, if Germany won then they were faced with the prospect of a German dominated continent. On the whole, Britain didn’t feel ready to go to war over Serbia.
Germany’s declaration of war on France and consequent attacks on Belgium, led to Britain keeping a promise made in 1839 to defend Belgium, resulting in Britain declaring war on Germany.

Alright, so from the search results, it's clear that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was a key short-term cause of World War I. It seems like this event was the spark that ignited the powder keg of existing tensions in Europe at the time. But I need to understand more about why this assassination led to a world war. Maybe I should look into the immediate aftermath of the assassination and how different countries reacted.

Let me see, according to the articles, after the assassination, Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the attack and issued an ultimatum with harsh demands. Serbia agreed to most of the demands but not all, which wasn't enough for Austria-Hungary, so they declared war on Serbia. Then, because Russia was allied with Serbia, they began to mobilize their army in support of Serbia. This action worried Germany, which was allied with Austria-Hungary, so Germany declared war on Russia. Things snowballed from there, with Germany also declaring war on France, and then invading Belgium, which brought Britain into the war due to its alliance with Belgium.

So, it seems like a chain reaction of alliances and defense pacts triggered the wider war. But I think there must be deeper, long-term causes that made the situation so volatile. Maybe I should look into the underlying tensions and rivalries between the European powers before 1914.

I recall something about the arms race, particularly between Britain and Germany. Germany had been building up its navy to rival Britain's, which must have caused a lot of tension. Also, there were imperialistic rivalries, with many European powers competing for colonies and influence around the world. Additionally, there were longstanding tensions in the Balkans, with various ethnic groups and nationalistic movements seeking independence or expansion.

Perhaps I should search for more information on these long-term causes.

Long-term Causes of World War I - HISTORY CRUNCH - History Articles, Biographies, Infographics, Resources and More
LONG-TERM CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I
World War I began in June of 1914, and is considered to have five major causes that led to the outbreak of the war.  These five causes include the four long-term causes (militarism, alliances, imperialism and nationalism) discussed in this reading and one short-term cause (the assassination of Franz Ferdinand) .  The four long-term causes each occurred in the years and decades before the actual outbreak of World War I, and all combined to set the stage for war in 1914.  Most people think of these as the MAIN causes of World War I as an easy to remember acronym.
​
MILITARISM AS A CAUSE OF WORLD WAR I
The first long-term cause of World War I is militarism.  Militarism can best be understood as the buildup or expansion of the ability of a country’s military to wage war.  In the decades before World War I many European countries began to practice militarism and worked to expand and strengthen their military forces.  For example, there was an intense arms race and naval race between several European nations in the buildup to World War I.  Specifically, France and Germany were heavily involved in an arms race in which each country doubled their armies between 1870 and 1914.  Both nations had a history of war against each other and their rivalry caused them to expand their military forces.  At the outbreak of fighting in 1914, France had approximately 4 million soldiers while Germany had over 4.5 million.  This arms race showed the distrust between the nations of Europe and when war did break out in 1914 it allowed the countries to go to war more easily.
In addition to the arms race, there was also a competitive naval race between Britain and Germany in the years leading up to World War I.  Britain had the largest navy in the world at the time, which it needed to maintain its vast colonial empire.  Germany viewed the British navy as a threat and sought to develop its own navy to match the powerful British navy.  Mostly Germany needed a strong navy to challenge British ships in the North Sea.  The North Sea was Germany's only coastal access but was difficult for Germany since the North Sea was connected to Britain and the British navy dominated the area.  Also related to the naval race was the development of the dreadnought.  Britain developed and launched the dreadnought in 1906 which was the first battleship to be developed in the 20th century.  The British dreadnought was notable for having larger caliber guns and for being faster on open water than any other earlier battleships.  In response, Germany developed its own version of the dreadnought and worked to challenge the power of the British.  By the outbreak of war in 1914, Britain had 29 dreadnoughts and Germany had 17.
In general, militarism showed the rivalry that existed between the nation of Europe in the years for the outbreak of World War I.  Also, militarism created the large forces that easily allowed the European nations to go to war in 1914.  If they had not built such large armies then the war may not have been so easy to begin and so devastating.

ALLIANCE SYSTEMS BEFORE WORLD WAR I
The second long-term cause of World War I was the system of alliances that existed in the years before the outbreak of war in 1914.  When World War I began Europe divided between two separate alliance systems.  Britain, France and Russia made up the Triple Entente while Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy made up the Triple Alliance .  Both sets of alliances were created in the years and decades before World War I between the partnering countries.  The assassination of Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand and the resulting crisis between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire caused each system of alliances to enact and World War I began.

To understand how the system of alliances led to the start of World War I, we first need to understand the series of events that unfolded after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June of 1914.  Immediately after the assassination, which was carried out by a Serbian nationalist organization called the Black Hand, Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia and began to threaten Serbia.  In response, Russia came to the defense of Serbia.  Russia did this as part of its larger movement for Pan-Slavism.  Pan-Slavism was the theory that supported the promotion of all Slavic people of which Russians and Serbians were both.  As such, Russia wanted to support the Serbians against Austro-Hungarian aggression because Russia viewed Serbians as sharing a similar ethnic heritage.  After Russia came to the defense of Serbia, Germany pledged its support to Austria-Hungary in the form of a 'blank check', meaning Germany was offering Austria-Hungary its unlimited support.  This act by Germany caused an alliance between Russia and France to take effect and both France and Britain were pulled into the conflict in support of Russia.  Italy was then also pulled into the conflict but on the side of the Triple Entente and fought extensively against the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the Alp Mountains.  Italy didn't enter the fighting until a year after World War I began, but ultimately entered on the side of the Triple Entente after a period of secret negotiations.  What had begun as a conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia had expanded to include all of the major powers in Europe.
Ultimately, the alliance systems that existed before the start of World War I obligated countries to go to war in defense of their allies.  This obligation is how countries such as Britain, France, Germany and Italy were pulled into the conflict.
​IMPERIALISM AS A CAUSE OF WORLD WAR I
The third main cause of World War I was European imperialism that occurred in the 1800’s and early 1900’s before World War I erupted in 1914.  Imperialism is understood as a process in which a country overtakes another country or region’s political, economic or social life.  Imperialism was carried out by the powerful European nations against the rest of world in the decades before World War I began.  For example, in the 19th century European nations carried out massive campaigns of imperialism against the regions of Africa in an event known as the Scramble for Africa .  The Scramble of Africa led to the start of World War I because it increased rivalry between the European nations as they fought against each other for territory in Africa and control over different regions.  For example, in 1884, German leader Otto von Bismarck called the Berlin Conference which had the European powers meet to discuss the division of Africa into regions controlled by the European nations.  The purpose of the meeting was to avoid starting a major European conflict and to lessen tensions because the Scramble for Africa was leading to an intense rivalry and distrust between the Europeans powers.  The peace created at the Berlin Conference did not last as the rivalry between the European powers increased as they approached 1914.
Moroccan Crisis
For instance, Britain and France were the two Europeans nations that had control over the largest regions of Africa during the Scramble for Africa and this caused tension with Germany.  Germany was angry that it lacked the colonies in Africa that both Britain and France had and resented their general role in Africa.  This anger by Germany would lead to the two Moroccan Crises that occurred before World War I.  Both crises occurred in the ten years before the outbreak of World War I and both involved France trying to gain control over Morocco while Germany worked to prevent France.  For example, the Second Moroccan Crisis, which occurred in 1911, began when Germany sent its warship (Panther) to Agadir, Morocco in July of that year.  The incident enraged the French who were considered to have a major interest in the region and both countries began threatening each other and talking of war.  While the two sides would eventually end the crisis through negotiations it still showed the level of rivalry and tensions that imperialism in Africa caused among the European nations.
Ultimately, these tensions led to a sense of anger and distrust among the European powers that helped to set the stage for war in 1914.
​NATIONALISM AS A CAUSE OF WORLD WAR I
The fourth and final long-term cause of World War I was the growth of nationalism that occurred in Europe in the decades before World War I and the tensions it caused.  Nationalism is best understood as when a group of people identify with each other and display a loyalty to their nation or country.  Nationalism grows when people share similar beliefs, values, ethnic heritage, relationship to land, language, culture and customs.  For example, both Germany and Italy unified from many separated kingdom states into unified nation-states in the late 1800’s.  These separate kingdoms unified as the people in those regions began to identify with each other and as nationalism swept across the people of Europe.
Nationalism was a major cause of World War I because it caused tensions and unrest to grow in certain parts of Europe.  For example, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was not made up of one single nation, but rather consisted of many different groups.  Many of these groups sought to have control over themselves and wanted sovereignty from the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  This created a great deal of unrest in the empire.  This was especially apparent in the Balkans, which is a region in Southeast Europe that contains many different nation-states.
In the years before World War I, the Balkans was under intense nationalistic tensions.  This was primarily due to the rise of nationalism in Europe and the influence of Austria-Hungary in the region.  The Austro-Hungary Empire extended into the Balkans on its southern borders and in the years before World War I it attempted to extend its control over the region.  Many historians now refer to the nationalistic tensions that were created in the region as a 'powder keg ', meaning that the tensions were so extreme that they were like a bomb ready to explode at any moment.
Ultimately, the assassination of Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand in June of 1914 was the 'spark' that lit the match of the Balkans Powder Keg and plunged Europe into World War I.  Nationalism as a movement in Europe in the years before World War I, created the tensions necessary for a small event like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to explode into the worldwide conflict that it became.

In 1914 World War I began. There were several causes of this war, and they could be divided into long and short term causes. The long term causes were imperialism, alliances, nationalism and militarism. The short term cause, which acted as a trigger to the Great War was the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 4-5) All the long term causes of the Great War were significant but perhaps the most noteworthy was militarism, which is the development of large and powerful military forces.
In the early 20th century Germany had the strongest and largest army in the world. Britain dominated the oceans, and both countries were working furiously to better each other in both aspects. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 5) The contest between the countries with large military forces built up conflict and tension, breeding mistrust and hatred between the nations and alliances. This conflict was greatest between Britain and Germany and both counties had no reservations about going to war with the other. There was great suspicion between the two. This brought the two countries and their alliances one step closer to war. The other larger nations in Europe were intent on increasing their military strength though conscription and also through new warfare technologies as well. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 5) This put the whole of Europe on edge and ready to fight and go to war. This frenzy for building up military force was encouraged by nationalism, the development of loyalty to your country.

When a country builds up their military force. By 1914, Germany and Britain were building up their navies, and France and Germany were building up their armies and equipment for armies.
A – Alliances
Formal agreements between countries to protect each other in times of war. If one an allied country declares war, the other is automatically involved in the war because of the alliance. There were two military alliances in Europe by 1914:
Triple Entente or “Allies” – Britain, France, Russia and later Italy
Central Powers – Austria-Hungary, Germany
I – Imperialism
When a country takes over lands to gain more territory. England had a huge empire which included Canada, Jamaica and India. Germany was beginning to grow her empire too. This made Germany more powerful, and France and Britain felt threatened by how much power Germany had.

N – Nationalism
Extreme pride in your country. It is different from patriotism (love of country) because nationalism is really about having all ethnically similar people together in a country and governing that country independently. Many national groups were controlled by empires at this time, so they were fighting for independence. Also, some countries unified as a stronger political unit and brought together national groups like Germany and Italy.

There was no particular cause for the rash of the First World War. The causes are much more complex than those of the Second World War and include short, intermediate and long term factors that all ended to cause the July Days in 1914. These factors include militarism, nationalism, imperialism, the alliance system, and industrialization as the long term causes. The intermediate causes included the crises in the Balkans and the short-term trigger for the war was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the Sarajevo, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary.
Militarism in the 19th and early 20th centuries involving the great powers of Europe was definitely important issue in the beginning of World War 1. Militarism means that the army and military powers are given a high profile by the government. More money was put into the military to increase arms and power of each country. This made each country ready and willing to fight one another. This build up and competition between the major powers developed into the arms race, which for many years put up looseness between Britain and Germany
An alliance is an agreement made between two or more countries to give each other help if it is needed. . If any one country was attacked the other members of the alliance was repeatedly forced into the war as well, even if they did not want to fight. When an alliance is signed, those countries become known as Allies. A number of alliances had been signed by countries between the years 1879 and 1914. These were important because they meant that some countries had no choice but to declare war if one of their allies. For example: in 1879 Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance to protect themselves from Russia.

World War One did not come about because of one problem that happened and it did not begin immediately either. The tensions and causes that prompted the first world war were long term as well as short term causes. Some of the long term causes were imperialism, militarism, nationalism and alliances.

	There were many long-term causes and short term causes that aided and pushed forward the impending Civil War. The short term causes, however, were the most effective because they happened quickly and completely divided the nation in half. The causes were not only rapid and influential, but they were also all the consequences of the prior, creating an exponential rampage of divergence which led the country straight to Civil War.

Nationalism also created conflict between countries that had very different customs and beliefs. Nationalism caused many large disputes between countries that could have been solved in a non violent manner. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 4) For example the powers in Germany were worried about the size and prowess of Britain’s navy and they did not solve this in a diplomatic way, they increased the size of their own naval forces and in response Britain developed their navy even more and developed an even greater mistrust of the Germans. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 5) This mistrust of the Germans developed into loathing and caused the English people to further believe that their own country was far more important than Germany or any of its allies. Distrust and conflict was also increased by imperialism, which is the development of power and influence through large empires.
In the 19th century the British Empire was the empire where “the sun never set”. The British Empire ruled over the colonies Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and many colonies in Asia and other areas of the world. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 6) This massive empire worried other countries, but especially Germany. When Germany started colonizing regions of the world, Britain, and its allies started to get worried about this new rival and this prompted even more tension and unease in Europe. Germany and its allies were increasingly hated for trying to build up an empire that was not wanted by the main powers of Europe, Britain and its allies. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 5) Nationalism developed alliances which, along with the murder of Franz Ferdinand, acted as a trigger to starting the Great War.
The two key alliances of the time were the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. These alliances were made up of Germany, Italy and the empire of Austria-Hungary, and France, Russia and Great Britain, respectively. The Triple Alliance was formed in 1882 and in response, in 1907 the Triple Entente was formed as a defense against any hostility from the Triple Alliance. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 4-5) There was much tension and suspicion between these two alliances and this was one of the prime causes of the Great War. The agreement of the alliances’ was that if another country mobilized against or attacked one of their allies they would go to their aid in battle. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 4-5) This agreement along with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand is what triggered the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance togo to war against each other.
Franz Ferdinand was shot dead on June 28, 1914. He was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. He was assassinated by a member of a Serbian terrorist group, the Black Hand. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 5-6) Austria-Hungry blamed Serbia for the death of the heir and declared war on Serbia. That is when the alliances came into play. Germany allied itself with Austria-Hungry and Russia with Serbia. When Russia mobilized against Austria-Hungry, Germany gave them (Russia) an ultimatum which was to stop, or else! (Australia and the World, source 4.6) When Russia didn’t stop, Germany declared war against Russia and moved all its forces into Belgium to attack France, (Russia’s ally) from the north, wipe out the French forces and then turn all its attention to Russia. This was called the Schlieffen Plan. (Humanities Alive 4, pp 13) The flaw in this plan was Germany didn’t expect Britain to come to Belgium’s aid and declare war on them. This is what eventuated, the entire British Empire was at war with Germany and its allies. This was the beginning of World War 1.
The four long term causes of World War 1, Imperialism, Nationalism, Alliances and Militarism all worked to put all of Europe on edge, and with all countries having great hostility towards each other. They stimulated hate, conflict and distrust between nations and alliances. The slightest upset in any of international relations could have started a war. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the trigger and his death set off a long but rapid line of events that started the First World War.

Okay, so from these search results, I've got a pretty good understanding of the short-term and long-term causes of World War I. The short-term cause was clearly the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which was the immediate trigger. But the long-term causes were more systemic issues that had been building up for years, like militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism.

Let me try to organize this in my mind. Militarism refers to the buildup of military strength and the glorification of military power. In the years leading up to World War I, many European countries were engaged in an arms race, especially between Britain and Germany in naval power, and between France and Germany in land forces. This constant competition and the belief that military strength was key to national prestige and security created an environment where war was more likely.

Next, alliances. Before World War I, Europe was divided into two main blocs: the Triple Entente, consisting of Britain, France, and Russia, and the Triple Alliance, made up of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. These alliances were formed for mutual protection, but they also made it so that a conflict between two countries could easily draw in their allies, turning a localized dispute into a much larger war.

Imperialism was another long-term cause. European powers were competing for colonies and spheres of influence around the world. This not only created economic tensions but also fostered a sense of rivalry and animosity between the powers. The scramble for colonies in Africa and competition in Asia added to the already strained relationships between European nations.

Lastly, nationalism played a significant role. Nationalism is the belief that one's own nation is superior and worth sacrificing for. In the context of pre-World War I Europe, nationalism led to ethnic groups within multi-ethnic empires, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, demanding independence or greater autonomy. This was particularly evident in the Balkans, where Slavic nationalism was rising, challenging Austro-Hungarian rule. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was carried out by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, who hoped to catalyze a uprising against Austro-Hungarian rule.

So, when the assassination happened, Austria-Hungary saw it as an opportunity to assert its authority over Serbia, which they blamed for supporting the assassins. They issued an ultimatum to Serbia with harsh demands, and when Serbia didn't comply fully, Austria-Hungary declared war. Because of the alliance systems, Russia mobilized to support Serbia, Germany mobilized to support Austria-Hungary, and so on, leading to a domino effect that drew in country after country.

It's also important to note that once the mobilization orders were issued, especially in the case of Germany and Russia, it was difficult to reverse them. The military plans in place were designed for swift mobilization and attack, leaving little room for diplomacy once the process had begun.

In summary, the long-term causes created a volatile environment where tensions were high and the stage was set for a conflict. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the spark that ignited this powder keg, leading to the outbreak of World War I.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The short-term cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, while the long-term causes included militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism.}} \]
