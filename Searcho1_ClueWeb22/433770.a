As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide information on why climate change is considered a threat based on scientific consensus and expert analysis.

First, I need to understand what climate change is. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Now, to address why it's a threat, I should consider its impacts on various aspects of life on Earth. Let me list some key areas:

1. **Rising Temperatures**: Global temperatures are increasing, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, which can be deadly, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly and young children.

2. **Sea-Level Rise**: Melting glaciers and thermal expansion of warming oceans cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and low-lying islands with flooding and loss of habitat.

3. **Extreme Weather Events**: Climate change is linked to more intense storms, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, which can devastate communities and ecosystems.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**: Changes in climate can disrupt ecosystems, leading to species extinction and loss of biodiversity, which are crucial for ecosystem services like pollination and oxygen production.

5. **Agricultural Impacts**: Altered precipitation patterns and increased temperatures can reduce crop yields, affecting food security and livelihoods, particularly in already vulnerable regions.

6. **Health Impacts**: Warmer temperatures can expand the range of disease vectors like mosquitoes, increasing the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Additionally, air quality may deteriorate, exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

7. **Economic Costs**: The damages from climate-related disasters and the necessary adaptations to mitigate these effects come at a significant economic cost, potentially undermining global economic stability.

8. **Social and Political Instability**: Resource scarcity and displacement due to climate impacts can lead to social unrest, migration pressures, and conflicts over resources.

To get a more comprehensive understanding, perhaps I should look into some specific examples or data that illustrate these points.

Let me consider searching for some recent studies or reports on the impacts of climate change.

Climate Change Significantly Impacts Global Health
Our Expertise Insights Health Innovation Journal Volume 4 Climate Change Significantly Impacts Global Health
Climate change will be the most significant force impacting global health. Impacts will arrive gradually, then suddenly. The healthcare industry may not respond in time.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HEALTH CRISIS
Climate change is a threat that looms large on the horizon – and yet it often seems to be a danger that will remain in the distance forever and will never catch up to us – until one day it does, just like COVID-19. Extreme weather events and trends such as higher temperatures and rising sea levels are raising the rate of death and disease, disrupting healthcare, and escalating costs. As climatic conditions move out of the “ Goldilocks zone ” in which species – humans included – evolved, the speed and scale of compounding effects may overwhelm societies, businesses, and governments around the world.
The health and life sciences sector is part of the problem: If the sector were a country, it would be the fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases on Earth due to the production, transport, and disposal of products and services across the life sciences supply chain.
However, this sector is also a crucial part of the solution: It has the opportunity to mediate the health impact of climate change, and to minimize the harm and inequities for patients, staff, and societies.
Health and economic disparities are magnified by climate change.
A Threat Multiplier
Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century . The below chart from Marsh McLennan Advantage’s Climate Health Threat Illustrator shows that the dangerous impact on health is complex and varied. Climate change will exacerbate the burden of every major disease category: infectious disease, chronic disease, mental health, injuries, and deaths.
Environmental events and trends harm people’s health directly and indirectly by altering complex and interdependent pathways — ones that are both natural and manmade (see exhibit). These pathways act as environmental, social, and economic determinants of health. For example, more frequent and intense storms can inflict more damage and injury – this is a direct result; they also can inflict more death by disrupting urgent and essential medical care – an indirect effect.
Climate impacts on health range from mild to severe and from acute to chronic. Wildfires and floods, for example, cause an initial spike in physical and mental health needs during each disaster, followed by a long tail of lasting poor health. Over time, this long tail amounts to multiples of the original surge in healthcare costs and productivity loss. Risks and outcomes once perceived as far off in time or space are unfolding. In time, they will intensify in both developed and developing countries.
Health and economic disparities are magnified by climate change, with the people and places the worst hit being least capable of coping. For example, the elderly, the poor, and people with pre-existing conditions face greater mortality risk during heatwaves. Rising temperatures and sea levels threaten both lives and livelihoods in tropical islands and regions, undermining their capacity to respond to catastrophes.
How Climate Change Impacts Health and Well-Being
Mortality risk will rise. More frequent and intense heatwaves will increase the risk of early death. Annual heat-related deaths could increase nine-fold in the US, from about 12,000 now to more 100,000 by 2100 in a high-emissions scenario. Besides the elderly, others at greater risk are children, the poor, and those with pre-existing conditions. As the planet warms, intensifying cyclones and hurricanes are likely to bring stronger winds and rain – and disrupt hospitals and other healthcare providers. In the three months after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017, for example, one-third of casualties may have died because medical care was disrupted or delayed.
People will experience more injuries. Hotter days are likely to increase the risk of self-harm and interpersonal violence. Hypotheses as to why this correlation exists range from climate-induced resource strain to people’s varying psychological responses to heat. In a high-emissions scenario, there may be 9,000 to 40,000 more suicides in the US and Mexico by 2050, as well as an additional 3.2 million violent crimes in the US by 2100. Rising ocean temperatures degrade coral reefs that ordinarily dissipate energy from sea waves, weakening a natural defense against coastal erosion, storms, and floods in low-lying coastal areas. By 2045, in a business-as-usual scenario, severe coral bleaching could expose 26 million people across the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia to injuries during storm surges.
Infectious disease will pose a greater threat. Climate change and air pollution act as risk multipliers increasing the risk of infection and death from respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. In the US, a small increase in long-term exposure to fine particulate pollution (PM 2.5) is associated with an eight percent increase of dying from COVID-19. Rising temperatures are spreading existing diseases and releasing long-dormant plagues. Dengue could spread to the Southeastern US by 2050 as mosquito transmission zones expand from the tropics. Arctic heatwaves are thawing permafrost and could revive sleeping pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses that cause anthrax, smallpox, or the 1918 influenza pandemic.
Chronic disease prevalence and related vulnerabilities will increase. Pre-existing conditions (for example, diabetes) and common medications, such as Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, reduce the body’s ability to cope with heat. As populations age and heatwaves become common, people may become more susceptible to dehydration and heat-related illnesses. Consider, for example, that short-term heat exposure spiked the relative risk of heart attacks in Germany from 1987 to 2014 – particularly for diabetics. As fire seasons grow longer and more severe, chronic ill health and significant costs related to smoke exposure are surging. In 2019, for example, the Black Summer bushfires affected 80 percent of Australia’s population. Premature deaths and hospital admissions accounted for more than half of the total costs of the fires. Survivors may face an increased risk of cancer as well as respiratory and heart disease.
Mental health issues will become more prevalent. Extreme weather can result in lasting mental illness. After severe flooding in England in 2013, for example, an estimated 37 percent of affected households suffered from anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress; public health and welfare costs are estimated to have topped $32 million. These symptoms can persist for years. Droughts, floods, hunger, and poverty are triggering forced migration from Central America’s Dry Corridor, for example, with migrants who are exposed to violence at home or in transit, suffering psychological impact. Some 56 percent of migrants screened in Mexico, for instance, had either moderate or serious symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress.
Annual heat-related US deaths could increase 9X between now and 2100 in a high-emissions scenario.
Reducing Carbon Footprints and Building Resilience
The health sector both contributes to climate change and must address its consequences: essential and elective care demand swings, diminished site and staff capacity, and cost pressures that threaten long-term viability. Health and life sciences organizations face physical risks of climate hazards (such as disrupted operations and supply chains); transition risks from rapid policy, technology, or market changes (including cuts in healthcare spending); and liability risks (for example, for poor health outcomes).
Yet the health sector – like other sectors – has been slow to mitigate and adapt. It has historically perceived impacts to be distant, complex, or uncertain, and has deferred systemic change. Providers, payers, governments, and employers must ensure essential health services and products remain available, affordable, and accessible to all who need it; policymakers, meanwhile, must pursue low-carbon policies and strengthen health systems.
To reduce health risks and costs for the communities they serve, health and life sciences organizations must begin by reducing emissions and building resilience. There are solutions providers, payers, life sciences, employers, and policymakers can adopt to drive meaningful and lasting change.
Providers: Lead by Example
Providers – hospitals, clinics, care facilities, and laboratories – have a large carbon footprint, with emissions coming from energy use in operations and supply chains. As climate change accelerates, providers face demand swings, diminished capacity, and financial stress. Specifically, providers will experience spikes and swells in the need for urgent and essential care due to acute and chronic climate hazards; disrupted or reduced capacity as climate hazards impair staff, supplies, and facilities; and lastly, delayed or forgone elective care, which poses an increasing health risk for patients and a financial strain for providers.
To cut emissions, providers must decarbonize facilities and supply chains where possible. For example, they must become energy-efficient, switch to renewable sources of energy and supplies, minimize waste, avoid unnecessary care, and use low-carbon technologies like telemedicine.
The health sector both contributes to climate change and must address its consequences.
Providers can also alleviate the health impacts of climate change in their communities. One way is to ensure continuity of care both during crises and in the long run by investing in climate-resilient facilities and technologies, sourcing from green supply chains, and devising flexible staffing and service models. Another way is to enhance community resilience by supporting public health measures to improve well-being and equity. A third way is to lead on climate solutions: to inform, engage, persuade, and partner with patients, staff, and other health sector stakeholders to promote climate action and prepare for health impacts.
Payers: Take a More Holistic Approach
Payers – health insurers and governments – face asset and liability pressures, as well as reputational risks. Climate change makes investments more volatile, particularly those in high-carbon sectors or those with significant exposure to physical risks. Claims may become unpredictable and unmanageable as costs soar due to health crises. Public payers serving older, poorer, and more vulnerable populations will face severe cost pressure. Rising premiums will widen the already large health protection gap and increase reputational and regulatory risks for private insurers.
Life Sciences: Prepare for a Changing Disease Burden
Pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, in particular, face pricing and patent challenges – pressures that add to the challenges and pushback from payers, providers, and patients who are all feeling the pinch as climate hazards increase the cost of healthcare. Plus, pharma and life-sciences companies also face “physical” risks such as disrupted operations and supply chains and transition risks from policy and technology changes.
Employers: Protect Your Workforce
Employers face greater risks to workers’ health and safety, thereby raising healthcare costs and lowering productivity, as climate change amplifies current health risks and introduces new ones.
Both indoor and outdoor workers may be exposed to heat, air pollution, or extreme weather at work. And, low-paid and migrant laborers can be especially vulnerable to these kinds of health risks.
Policymakers: Promote Steps Toward Resilience
Policymakers face varied and complex threats to public health from climate hazards, including: deteriorating determinants of health, increasing healthcare needs and costs, growing inequalities in health, intensifying geopolitical tensions from climate migration, and the financial burden of being lenders and insurers of last resort.
The health sector must strike a balance between efficiency and resilience.
All Stakeholders Must Reduce Their Carbon Footprints
The health sector must strike a balance between efficiency and resilience, cutting emissions and costs without sacrificing preparedness. All stakeholders have room to assess and reduce their climate-related vulnerabilities, and to encourage and incentivize others to go green. Some changes will increase efficiency and resilience: For example, clean energy and low-carbon technologies can reduce emissions, protect public health, and keep health services running through crises. Other options present trade-offs, such as just-in-case capacity and stockpiles of essential supplies that boost resilience but also costs, resources, or emissions.
Payers: Here are four solutions for payers to help societies understand, reduce, and cope with climate-change health risk in a more holistic manner. First, curb emissions in operation and channel investments into green assets. Second, incentivize healthcare to go green – for example, by preferring sustainable providers, developing policies to reduce unnecessary care, reflecting climate risks in pricing, and/or encouraging risk reduction. Third, payers can reduce health impacts and inequities by developing products/models to ensure universal access to affordable prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, and by taking a holistic approach toward improving key health determinants, such as food and housing. Finally, payers must ensure operational and financial resilience by providing adequate and sustainable coverage to everyone who needs it. Working together, public and private payers can pool risks and limit losses more effectively and equitably.
Pharma and Life Sciences: Pharma and life sciences companies have opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint. First, curb emissions: reduce energy use, switch to renewable sources of energy and supplies, minimize waste, and invest in low-carbon technologies and techniques such as green chemistry. Second, make supply chains more resilient: reconfigure suppliers to account for emissions and vulnerabilities to climate and political or regulatory shocks. Third, prepare for a rapidly changing disease burden: align product pipelines (such as medications for tropical diseases or heat-related illness), and invest in rapid response capabilities and partnerships (for example, to repurpose drugs, devise tests, or discover vaccines for new infections). Lastly, reduce health impacts and inequities: prioritize affordable innovation and essential products including antibiotics and antivirals.
Employers: Besides reducing their carbon footprint, there are four ways employers can reduce workers’ vulnerability to climate impacts: first, monitoring climate-related risks to physical and mental health; second, mitigating risks through training and changes to work sites, schedules, practices, and equipment (such as climate-resilient buildings and personal protective equipment); third, ensuring there is guidance and support for affected workers; and fourth, improving socio-economic determinants of health (such as financial resilience). As payers, employers can design and select health benefits to promote sustainable healthcare delivery and increase workers’ resilience to climate events.
Policymakers: To minimize health impacts, policymakers should drive mitigation and adaptation efforts in the following ways: First, make “no-regret moves” such as low-carbon policies that promote clean air, water, housing, and transport, as well as healthy food and physical activity. Second, strengthen health systems by investing in resilient infrastructure, equipment, workforce, and supply chains; ensure sufficient supplies of essential products; and reward sustainability measures. Third, build national and community resilience by integrating direct and indirect health impacts into disaster planning and risk reduction. Fourth, ensure effective crisis response by monitoring climate trends and health impacts. Lastly, spur investment and innovation now to avert or respond to crises rapidly.
One of COVID-19’s lessons has been the cost of inaction and the value of preparedness, prompt response, resilience, and coordination. Given the clear links from climate to health harms and the lag between emissions and consequences, urgent action is vital. The right responses today will go a long way toward reducing risks and the need to make even more drastic and expensive changes tomorrow.

Abstract
Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.

What are the impacts of climate change on health?
Climate change has intensified in the last several decades, and so have the impacts of climate change on human health. These include direct impacts resulting from:
occupational health risks
increases in noncommunicable diseases and disorders like respiratory diseases, heart disease, depression, and mental disorders
population displacement
from rising sea levels
increases in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat
changes in the distribution & burden of vector-borne diseases & water-borne infectious diseases
Extreme weather events are associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders
Extreme heat is one of the leading causes of weather-related deaths in the US. It has been estimated that as many as                         
                         die from heat each year

Who is at risk for the health risks associated with climate change?
Every American f aces a health risk associated with climate change.
Many people, however, are more vulnerable than others.
Some people have a higher exposure
generations of targeted disinvestment and environmental injustice have increased exposure to climate change threats particularly in low-income Black, Latino, and Native American communities
Low-income populations
Occupational groups
people who work outdoors like first responders and
construction workers face more frequent and
longer exposure to climate change threats
certain populations are more likely to be exposed to climate change threats like fires, droughts, floods or severe storms
People in specific locations
Some people are more sensitive to the changing climate
Pregnant women
Children
People with pre-existing conditions
Some people experience more barriers than others
People with disabilities face challenges preparing for and responding to extreme weather. Emergency and evacuation instructions and processes are often not accessible to people with certain disabilities.
Indigenous people who rely on subsistence agriculture have limited options to adapt to climate change. Rising temperatures and the changing growing season affects their way of life.
Older adults have limited ability to cope with extreme weather events and are less likely to access support services. Adults 65+ are physically more affected by the increasing heat than other ages.
What can be done to slow climate change and protect health?
Integrating public health measures to tackle climate disruption cannot be an afterthought, health considerations must be incorporated into national & global resilience strategies.
Promote sustainable diets and
food systems
Prepare the health care system to handle new and emerging diseases & infections
Create more walkable, bikeable and transit friendly communities
Strengthen peer-to-peer support networks and human connections
Enforce strong policies around air,
water and soil pollution & clean up
Improve water, sanitation and providing point-of-use disinfection tools
Work with vulnerable communities to promote resilience & connect them to resources
Partner with industry & government to prioritize systems that value human well-being
There should be a constant push for more research on how to protect health in the age of climate change
About this Data Insights
Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity and it is disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged according to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) special report. Climate change is affecting global weather patterns and weather variability is only increasing, causing a greater number of heat waves and floods that are far more extreme and last far longer. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate, but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for them. These risks are unevenly distributed, creating new inequities and exacerbating those that already existed.

Potential Impacts on Human Health
The activities of humans release pollutants into the Earth’s atmosphere. Some of these pollutants are greenhouse gases that can trap the Sun’s energy. The result has been a gradual increase in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. The result of this global warming has been global climate change.
Increased global temperature, rising sea levels, and precipitation changes, with more extremes in weather, are expected to have ill effects on public health. Increased morbidity, mortality, and displacement are expected due to global climate change. The graphic above shows the potential impacts of global climate change on human health.
Potential Impacts of Global Climate Change on Human Health Changes in global climate are expected to adversely affect communities worldwide. Storms will be more intense and flooding more common. Higher temperatures will lead to heat-related illnesses and longer allergy seasons. Droughts could be more persistent while arctic sea ice and spring snowpack shrink. Changes in rainfall amounts will lead to disruptions in the global food supply. The number, size, and strength of wildfires is predicted to increase. Organisms that transmit viruses and other pathogens will be able to infect people in larger geographic ranges. Air pollution will trigger more respiratory diseases.  Mental health and stress-related disorder could increase. Altering the basic human needs of food, clean water, clean air, and shelter is likely to result in civil conflict.
Sadly, these changes are expected to have disproportionate effects on people. People without access to health care will likely suffer more. People who are very young or very old are usually less able to cope with sudden changes. People and nations without wealth will be less able to respond to rapidly changing living conditions. Extreme events can strain on our health system and emergency services.  Climate-related economic impacts such as  financial losses from flooding, changes in crop yield, and increased patients seeking care for heat-related illness at medical facilities have also been observed. Reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation are both important strategies to mitigating the human health and economic impact of climate change.

Climate Change Is Having a Major Impact on Global Health
Warming temperatures are exposing more people to heat waves and increasing the risk of disease spread
By Tanya Lewis on March 1, 2019
Prolonged and deadly heat waves are becoming more common, leaving millions at risk. Credit: Matteo Colombo Getty Images
A devastating heat wave swept across Europe in 2003, killing tens of thousands of people, scientists estimate. Many were elderly, with limited mobility, and some already suffered from chronic diseases. But climate change is making such extreme weather more common—and the effects will not be limited to the old and sick. Warming temperatures do not only threaten lives directly. They also cause billions of hours of lost labor, enhance conditions for the spread of infectious diseases and reduce crop yields, according to a recent report.
The report, published last December in the Lancet, represents the latest findings of the Lancet Countdown—a coalition of international research organizations collaborating with the World Health Organization and the World Meteorological Organization. The group tracks the health impacts of—and government responses to—climate change.
“It affects everyone around the world—every single person, every single population. No country is immune,” says Nick Watts, executive director of the Lancet Countdown and one of many co-authors of the report. “We've been seeing these impacts for some time now.”

The report found that millions of people worldwide are vulnerable to heat-related disease and death and that populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are especially susceptible—most likely because they have more elderly people living in urban areas. Adults older than 65 are particularly at risk, as are those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes. Places where humans tend to live are exposed to an average temperature change that is more than twice the global average—0.8 versus 0.3 degree Celsius (graphic ). There were 157 million more “heat wave exposure events” (one heat wave experienced by one person) in 2017 than in 2000. Compared with 1986 to 2005, each person was exposed to, on average, 1.4 more days of heat wave per year from 2000 to 2017. That may not seem like a lot, but as Watts notes, “someone who is 75 and suffers from kidney disease can probably survive three to four days of heat wave but not five or six.”
Sweltering temperatures also affect productivity. A staggering 153 billion hours of labor—80 percent of them in agriculture—were lost to excessive heat in 2017, the new report found, with the most vulnerable areas being in India, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. The first stage of heat's impact is discomfort, says report co-author Tord Kjellstrom, director of the Health and Environment International Trust in New Zealand and a consultant on environmental and occupational health. But there comes a point at which it is simply too hot for the body to function. For example, sweating heavily without replenishing water can result in chronic kidney disease, Kjellstrom notes. News reports have documented farm workers in Central America dying from kidney problems after years of working in the hot fields. Richer countries such as the U.S. may avoid the worst effects because of better access to drinking water and, in the case of indoor work, air-conditioning. But these solutions can be expensive, Kjellstrom says.
Then there are indirect effects. For example, warmer temperatures have increased the geographical ranges of organisms that spread dengue fever, malaria and cholera. The “vectorial capacity”—a measure of how easily a disease carrier can transmit a pathogen—of dengue virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, reached a record high in 2016. The percentage of coastline suitable for bacteria in the Vibrio genus (which includes the species that causes cholera) increased from the 1980s to the 2010s in the Baltic region and northeastern U.S. by 24 and 27 percent, respectively. In Africa's highlands, environmental suitability for the malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum parasite increased by nearly 21 percent from the 1950s to the 2010s.
Climate change also threatens food security. Our planet still produces more than enough food for the world, but 30 countries have seen crop yields decline as a result of extreme weather, the report found.
“Overall, the report does suggest very serious concerns about the way in which climate change is evolving and its potential implications for human health,” says Andy Haines, a professor of environmental change and public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the 2018 report but has co-authored previous Lancet Countdown assessments. “One of the problems is that we don't have enough data on the actual impacts, particularly in the low-income countries,” which will likely be most affected, he says.
The report did find some bright spots: in 2015, 30 of 40 countries surveyed by the WHO reported having climate change health adaptation plans, and 65 percent of cities have undertaken (or are undertaking) risk assessments that address threats to public health infrastructure. But worldwide spending on health adaptation is still under 5 percent of all climate adaptation spending. And funding has not matched that pledged in the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord that is set to take effect in 2020.
Among the biggest steps countries can take to mitigate these health effects are phasing out coal-fired power and shifting to greener forms of transportation, Watts says. Electric vehicles are making inroads in places, he notes—and “active” transport, such as walking or cycling, is also important. Tallying up the costs of climate change, Watts says, makes it clear that “our response or lack of response is going to determine our health over the next century.”

Alright, so I've got this information from these documents about how climate change affects global health. It seems pretty serious. Let me try to summarize what I've read.

First, climate change is mainly caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. This, in turn, causes various changes in climate patterns, such as more frequent and severe heatwaves, storms, and changes in precipitation.

Now, these changes have direct and indirect impacts on human health. Direct impacts include things like heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses during heatwaves, injuries or deaths from extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods, and mental health issues stemming from trauma or displacement.

Indirect impacts are maybe a bit more nuanced. For example, changes in climate can alter the habitats and behaviors of disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes, leading to the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever into new areas. Warmer temperatures can also affect the growth and distribution of allergens like pollen, potentially worsening allergies and asthma.

Additionally, climate change affects food security and nutrition. Extreme weather events can damage crops, leading to food shortages and price increases. This is particularly problematic in already vulnerable regions, where access to nutritious food is crucial for maintaining health.

Another aspect is the economic impact. The costs associated with responding to climate-related disasters, treating climate-related illnesses, and adapting to changing environments can be substantial. These expenses can strain healthcare systems and economies, further exacerbating health disparities.

It's also important to note that certain populations are more vulnerable to these health risks. The elderly, young children, people with pre-existing health conditions, and those living in poverty or in areas with limited resources are at higher risk. For example, during heatwaves, elderly people in urban areas might not have access to air conditioning or might not be able to cool down effectively due to underlying health issues.

Looking at the bigger picture, climate change is considered a threat multiplier. It exacerbates existing health inequalities and can lead to social unrest and conflict over resources like water and arable land. This can further deteriorate public health conditions.

So, in summary, climate change poses a multifaceted threat to global health through direct impacts like heat-related illnesses and indirect effects such as the spread of infectious diseases and compromised food security. Addressing this requires comprehensive strategies that include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing public health preparedness, and supporting vulnerable populations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change is a threat to global health due to its direct and indirect impacts, including increased frequency of heatwaves and extreme weather events, spread of infectious diseases, and compromised food security, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.}} \]
