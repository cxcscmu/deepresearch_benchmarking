I'm trying to figure out if the American Dream is still alive for immigrants. Now, the American Dream is this idea that anyone can come to America and, through hard work and determination, achieve success and a better life. It's a pretty powerful concept that has drawn people from all over the world to the United States for centuries. But is it still reality for immigrants today? I need to think about this carefully and see what evidence there is to support or contradict this idea.

First, I should probably define what the American Dream means in this context. Traditionally, it includes things like homeownership, financial stability, good education for children, and the opportunity to advance socially and economically. For immigrants, it often means escaping poverty, political oppression, or other difficulties in their home countries and building a new, better life in America.

So, to assess whether the American Dream is still alive for immigrants, I need to look at current immigrant experiences in the U.S. Are they able to find jobs, improve their economic status, access education, and eventually own homes? Also, I should consider any barriers they might face, such as discrimination, legal obstacles, or economic challenges.

Let me start by considering employment opportunities for immigrants. Do immigrants find it easy to get jobs in the U.S.? Or are there significant hurdles?

Immigrant Career Opportunities in America
Ginger Abbot: Research shows there is less wage discrepancy for immigrants from Western Europe, Canada and Japan compared to those who relocate from developing nations.

Immigrant Career Opportunities
Understanding Professional Prospects and Improving Employment Outlook for Immigrants
In the United States, there is a wide variety of job opportunities for immigrants. Jobs are available in almost every industry, which appeals to many foreigners. In fact, many immigrants choose to become entrepreneurs because of the unique opportunities America offers.
To understand the U.S. job market for immigrants, it’s crucial to recognize which factors play a role in determining professional prospects. Only then can the employment outlook for immigrants improve. Keep reading to learn what kinds of opportunities are available for immigrants and which elements could change in the future.
Understanding Professional Prospects
To determine the best professional prospects for immigrants, consider the five factors below.
1. Common Industries for Immigrant Employment
In recent years there has been a shift in the industries occupied by immigrants. While, historically, most immigrants occupied lower-wage positions that required little to no formal education, in recent years, more immigrants are seeking jobs in sectors with significant education requirements.
The shift seen in industry breakdowns is primarily influenced by job market demand. Highly skilled immigrants are more likely to obtain official work visas if they offer exceptional skills and abilities. Additionally, the demand for workers in these areas equates to higher salaries.
Regardless, in 2019, foreign-born workers were more likely to be employed in service occupations than U.S. natives. Industries that offer significant opportunities for immigrants include:
Nursing
Business
Social services
Construction and maintenance
Education
Science
2. Pay Discrepancies Between Native-Born People and Immigrants
Data analyzed by the Social Security Administration indicates there is an inverse relationship between earnings. While most immigrants start with significantly lower salaries than their native counterparts, with time, foreigners often experience faster wage growth than their native equivalents.
As with any job analysis, the wages will differ significantly based on industry. Careers in STEM fields are frequently higher-paying than jobs needing unskilled labor. Additionally, salary benefits will be higher for those with degrees and significant work experience.
Research shows there is less wage discrepancy for immigrants from Western Europe, Canada and Japan compared to those who relocate from developing nations. This is likely because the education systems in these countries are well-funded and standardized, making it easier for employers to evaluate immigrants’ skill levels with foreign degrees.
3. Differences in the Application and Hiring Process
The U.S. job market for immigrants offers multiple application paths. If an immigrant already lives in the county and has obtained a green card, they have the right to apply for any position they see fit. Federal law prohibits discrimination based on a person’s national origin, color or religion. This means immigrants have legal protection from the government during the hiring process, which reduces unfair hiring practices.
If an immigrant wants to work in the United States but does not hold a green card or right to work permit, they must have a company sponsor their visa application. In this situation, the applicant would need to locate a company and receive a job offer before immigrating to America.
4. Unique Requirements for Employers
The government requires that employers ask for identity and employment authorization from any immigrant hired after November 6, 1986. They must also complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form and keep a copy on file.
The government can charge employers with civil violations if they knowingly hire, refer or recruit an unauthorized alien for employment in America. Additionally, they can be charged if they continue employing an unauthorized foreign worker after becoming aware of their status.
5. Job Opportunities for Immigrants
In 2018, 44.8 million foreign-born people lived in the U.S., and 77% were legally in the country. These individuals make up about 17% of the U.S. labor force. As the job market grows, opportunities for well-paid positions expand.
Immigrants make up roughly 35% of construction and maintenance jobs in the United States. People in these positions are typically paid above minimum wage regardless of their education level. Other high-paying occupational sectors are continuing to grow and offer new opportunities for immigrants.
Improving the Employment Outlook for Immigrants
The United States has more immigrants than any other country. These immigrants offer varied perspectives and improve the economy. While immigrants only account for 13.7% of the population, they comprise 20% of the country’s entrepreneurs. By improving the employment outlook for immigrants, the government invites new talent and jobs to the market.
How to Immigrate to the U.S. With a Working Visa
Careers in education, art, business and science represent the best jobs for immigrants who come to America. Individuals who are exceptionally skilled in these fields, fall into the first preference permanent work visa category. There are five preference categories that cover a wide range of occupations.
To qualify, most candidates must be highly skilled or a business investor who employs at least 10 full-time U.S. workers. Extensive research will help interested applicants evaluate their chances of receiving a work visa.
Ways to Improve the Process
Immigrants face barriers to entering the job market — specifically relating to education, citizenship and visa status and foreign language knowledge. If the United States hopes to draw in new talent, it should create programs that make work visas more accessible to skilled workers.
Additionally, there should be alternative requirements for government positions that require citizenship, since not all immigrants choose to naturalize. Depending on the security clearance, some job descriptions should offer a residency requirement rather than citizenship. Programs should support those who are interested in learning English to maximize the talent that already exists in the country.
At the college level, scholarships and funding make schooling more affordable to immigrants. Universities should work to make it easier for talented international students to create careers in the U.S. through job placements.
Immigrants Are a Vital Part of U.S. Society
Immigrants are a vital part of U.S. society and play a pivotal role in the economy. America continues to draw in new talent, but by adopting new immigration policies, the country could appeal to a greater number of skilled individuals. Immigrants should prioritize their education to apply for high-paying positions.

Construction Worker
Stone Mason

Security Guards
Security guard positions may be a bit harder to come by unless you have experience with this type of work. If you’re a natural born protector, then this is an ideal position for you.
Food and Beverage Industry
This is an industry in which you can advance from one position to the next. Even if you get hired on as a hostess or dishwasher, you may find yourself being promoted to a management position or operating as the lead cook once you’ve shown off your skills!

Alright, so from these search results, it seems like there are job opportunities for immigrants in the U.S., especially in certain fields like healthcare, technology, and customer service. The documents mention that immigrants can find employment in areas such as medical writing, computer software engineering, human resources, and more. They also highlight that some employers sponsor visas for skilled workers, which is encouraging.

But I need to consider both sides of the story. While there are job opportunities, are there also significant barriers that make it difficult for immigrants to achieve the American Dream? For example, issues like discrimination, language barriers, and legal obstacles could hinder their progress.

Let me think about discrimination first. Is there evidence of discrimination against immigrants in the workplace?

Discrimination in the Workplace for Immigrants
Work Life
Discrimination in the Workplace for Immigrants
By Priti Ramjee
i
Coming into the country with the American dream, you find a job and have high hopes for a better life. As a new immigrant, you might encounter discrimination in the workplace and face challenges with acceptance. As you understand and trust the laws supporting you, you develop confidence in handling unfair situations in the workplace. Soon you find your path to the better life you dreamed of.
Protection
As an immigrant, if you are authorized to work in the U.S., the Immigration and Nationality Act protects you from discrimination in the workplace. An employer cannot discriminate against you just because you are from another country. Nor can he fire you, harass you or refuse to promote you. You are entitled to the same rights as nonimmigrants. If you believe you are a victim of discrimination you can file a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) or the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC).
Vulnerability
Some employers feel they can take advantage of you. You might work long hours with low wages and poor working conditions. If you don't speak English well or tend to isolate yourself because of your cultural background, you might feel insecure about standing up for your rights. Your employer might take advantage of your vulnerable position resulting in discrimination and exploitation in the workplace. If the OSC or the EEOC decide not to pursue your case, you can still take action by filing a lawsuit against your employer.
Wage Gap
According to the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan educational institute, there is a pronounced wage gap between an immigrant woman and a naturalized man in the workplace. As the primary caregiver to your family as a woman, you need your job to pay your bills. You realize that if you don't speak up about the effect of discrimination on your wages and on the wages of other women, your employer might think that you don't know that he is paying you less than others. On the other hand, if you do speak up you're worried about losing your job. There is a way to handle the situation. Do your homework on the relative wages in your market. Approach your boss with your concerns. Discrimination will affect your wages unless you take the initiative to stand up for yourself.
Public Programs
If you are a victim of discrimination in the workplace as an immigrant or if you know of someone who has been discriminated against because of her origin, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) can provide you with more information on your rights. They have services for victims of immigration-related employment discrimination. whether you have been asked for unreasonable documentation as part of your employment eligibility, treated unfairly, harassed, or been subjected to other forms of discrimination in the workplace. The programs provide seminars and educational material so that you understand what discrimination means, your rights, and what you can do about it.

Immigration and Discrimination in the Workplace Essay
Exclusively available on IvyPanda
Updated: Aug 16th, 2019
In the 21 st century, Americans have experienced the impact of a globalized economy. It can be seen in relatively easy movement of people from one country to another. In the past, immigration was seen as a positive force for nation building. However, nowadays, immigration has become a problematic issue, especially when viewed from the perspective of limited resources and job places. Another aspect of immigration that needs to be discussed is discrimination in the workplace.

Discrimination exists due to the stereotypes that employers and co-workers associate with a particular ethnic group. It is, therefore, important to appreciate the importance of immigrants in nation building, especially when it comes to the United States of America. The ability to see a big picture and the need to appreciate the contribution of immigrants to U.S. economy will reduce the incidences of discrimination in the workplace.
There are two main issues when it comes to discrimination of immigrants in the workplace. First, there is the issue of competition and limited resources. The argument is that immigrants will compete with few jobs available to the unemployed. In other words, if the number of immigrants increases, there will be less jobs be available to the U.S. citizens. The source of discrimination was made even more problematic after the financial crisis that severely affected the job market in the United States.
There was also the added challenge of outsourcing wherein American companies established businesses outside the country, especially in the countries with low wages. Therefore, many argued that it would not be wise to increase the number of immigrants because they would increase the competition in the jobs available in the market.
As a consequence of this belief, the U.S. Federal government created laws that significantly reduced the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country. At the same time, these laws gave the power to search for, apprehend and deport illegal immigrants. There is the need to find out if these fears are based on real facts.
Those who oppose immigration base their argument on the following statement that “a surge of low-skilled immigrants should increase the supply of such workers, driving down wages at the expense of working-class Americans” (Parker, p.1).
It is easy to understand why many Americans are anxious when it comes to the presence of immigrants that can be viewed as competitors, when it comes to the job market. However, it is much more important to see the whole picture and realize that immigrant workers are indispensable to the U.S. economy.

According to analysts, immigrant workers are important because “they do jobs most Americans wouldn’t take, for wages they wouldn’t want” (Quintanilla, p.1). A restaurant may not be able to operate without a chef, but it will also go out of business without a dishwasher. Furthermore, “lower-wage labor helps create more work for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are generally native born” (Isidore, p.1).
The report from the U.S. Department of Labor gives another proof because it says that “at least half of the nearly 2 million crop workers in the United States are illegal aliens … the cheap labor they provide is crucial to the $30 billion U.S. farm industry” (Parker, p.1). It is, therefore, critical to have immigrant workers.
The second issue raised when it comes to stereotypes and how they can affect the employment is discrimination in the workplace. According to the study by Paludi & DeSouza, the problem is widespread, “Discrimination based on ethnic stereotyping is normative for many employees in workplaces in the United States (p.88). Therefore, at this level, discrimination can negatively affect the chances an employer will hire an immigrant.
It is possible that employers can be compelled to hire immigrants because of immigration laws, but this does not mean that discrimination in the workplace is non-existent. There is a different type of discrimination that an immigrant may experience at the workplace.
Consider the following statement by a victim of this type of discrimination, “When a stereotype about your group is relevant to performance in a particular domain, you are likely to experience anxiety – from feeling threatened by the perceived likelihood that others think you will not succeed and fearing that you will confirm these beliefs” (Deaux, p.84). In other words, an immigrant is less likely to be promoted if there is discrimination in the workplace.
There is a need to eradicate discrimination because immigrants are also people that are simply driven by a common human desire and the need to pursue happiness. Therefore, if there is a political or economic problem in their homeland, it is their right to seek a better place to live in. If there is a famine in their homeland, it is natural that they go to other countries in search for better opportunities and future for their family. It is also understandable that they are eager to bring the whole family to a new country in order to build a better life.
The right to immigrate can be availed during times of war, famine, and political persecution (Clark, p.26). However, the United States limits the number of immigrants that can enter and settle in this country.

Furthermore, U.S. laws granted certain law enforcement agencies to track down and apprehend those who do not have the necessary documents to stay in the country. However, the worst thing is that immigrants are treated as if they are not humans. Therefore, the locals and authorities do not respect them in the same way that they respect their friends and relatives.
Another major reason why it is wrong to prevent the immigration of people can be seen in the economic and cultural benefits that diversity can bring (Hall, p.54). Consider, for instance, the contribution of the first wave of immigrants to the United States; these were Italians, Irish, Scots and others. According to the study by Hall who examined the contribution of Italian immigrants, “These people were, on the whole, peaceable and industrious, and improved the trades in which they engaged” ( p.55).
A review of American history reveals that there were many immigrants who were instrumental in revolutionizing different sectors of society. Their contributions had a considerable impact on sports, film, food, telecommunications, Information Technology, engineering, and other spheres. Without their contribution, it would be impossible to imagine how the United States would have gained its status.

The first step in the journey towards the reduction of discrimination in the workplace is to have a clear understanding of the contribution of immigrants to the economy. The second step is to create appropriate laws and be aware of existing laws that were created to protect the rights of immigrant workers. For example, employers must realize that there exists an Immigration Act and in the said law, which states that it is illegal for an employer with three or more employees to:
discriminate in hiring and firing workers, except for illegal aliens;
discriminate on the basis of the person’s citizenship;
retaliate against employees because they made a complaint based on immigration laws (Repa, p.478).
After studying immigration laws, the next thing to do is to develop policies with regard to diversity in the workplace. The creation of such a policy is only possible if the employers and the co-workers understand the value of diversity in the workplace within a particular organization.
Consider, for example, a scenario where there was an automotive dealership in the city where there were many Spanish and Chinese speaking people. In the said scenario, the corporate leaders of the said automotive dealership did not create a diversified team of sales representatives and supervisors.
The corporate leaders did not probably realize the existence of potential customers that could not properly communicate using the English language. As a result, the potential customers are unable to express what they want.
At the same time, the businesses in the area could not communicate what they were offering to their clients because of the language barrier. The solution to this problem would be the creation of a diversified team. A creation of a diversified team is only possible if there is a policy that allows the employers to hire Spanish and Chinese speaking sales representatives.

It is not an easy task to create and develop a diversified workforce. The employers and the workers have to deal with discrimination as well as conflicts that may arise due to differences in culture. However, managers of organizations are aware of the potential of a diversified workforce to increase their revenue. It is, therefore, important to study the benefits of diversity and appreciate the contribution of immigrant workers to the society.
Conclusion
As mentioned earlier, discrimination is a normal reaction because people tend to have a negative perception of other individuals who came from a different country and have different culture. In other words, it is easy to judge something that a person cannot understand. Discrimination is also rooted in misunderstanding and fears. For example, many Americans are anxious that the migrant workers are taking away their jobs.
However, it has been made clear that many of the immigrants in America are low-skilled workers able to do only the jobs that many Americans would not handle anyway, such as dishwashing, gardening, fruit picking. On the other hand, some immigrant workers are highly skilled and contribute to the growth of the economy. In fact, the United States achieved its progress because of the contribution of immigrants. It is, therefore, important to be aware of the importance of immigrant workers.
At the same time, it is also important to be aware of current immigration laws. Furthermore, there is also the need to develop a policy with regard to diversity in the workplace. The creation of a diversified team will create a competitive advantage for the employers. For example, if a business unit does not have a Chinese-speaking representative, it will be impossible to communicate to Chinese-speaking customers.

Discrimination against Immigrants Essay
Exclusively available on IvyPanda
Updated: May 25th, 2019
The United States has always been branded as a land of opportunities and this has consequently attracted many immigrants to the country. Immigrants arrive in the U.S without expecting any kind of discrimination but they often end up in disappointment. Immigrants face different types of discrimination in the course of their stay in the U.S that make their assimilation into the American society very difficult.

Discrimination against immigrants has been in existence from the colonial era and is still prevalent in the U.S (Lentin, 2011). The most common types of discrimination that the immigrants in the U.S encounter are language-based discrimination and racial discrimination.
The major immigrant groups that are in most cases exposed to acts of discrimination include Italian Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Arab Americans and the Hispanics (Lentin, 2011). Despite the efforts that have been put in place by the American government towards stopping discrimination, the most recent immigrants still complain of various forms of discrimination. This paper will highlight the different forms of discrimination that confront immigrants in the U.S.
The immigrants in the United States have a problem in finding employment because of their race and language (Lentin, 2011). The majority of companies in the U.S prefer hiring Native Americans compared to immigrants even in a situation where an immigrant is more qualified for a particular job than a native applicant. Statistics indicate that immigrants are the worst paid employees and yet they do the hardest jobs in America (Lentin, 2011).
This trend has been there since 1800s and there are no signs of improvement. Most government policies favor Native Americans and this has been a great challenge for the ethnic minorities living in the U.S. The fear of losing their jobs to immigrants makes the Native Americans angry and full of resentment towards immigrants. The refusal by some immigrants to learn the local language makes the native people think that immigrants do not respect the established norms.
The negative stereotypes associated with certain ethnic groups increase the chances of discrimination in the American society (Lentin, 2011). It is very easy to fuel antagonism if much focus is put on the negative stereotypes that are associated with a particular minority group. Cases of bias-motivated crime are on the increase with immigrants being the main targets of this type of crimes.
The Latinos who live in California have over time been attacked as a result of the anti-immigrant sentiments in the U.S. Native Americans are inclined to the view that most of their economic and social problems have been generated by the influx of immigrants into their country. The recent increase in terror attacks has not made things better for Americans of the Arabic descent (Lentin, 2011). The Arabs in the U.S have become victims of hate crimes just because they have the same national background with the perceived terrorists.

Language-based discrimination has become very prevalent in the U.S and the immigrants who refuse the idea of learning the native language face unfair treatment (Lentin, 2011). Immigrant groups encounter discrimination at their places of work where employers come up with polices that favor native English speakers.
Employers have always defended their actions by claiming that the policies are only meant to enhance efficiency and safety but this is not the case. Immigrant groups with high immigration rates are the most targeted because the natives fear that they might overturn their dominance (Lentin, 2011). The need to retain the hegemonic position of Native Americans is what motivates employers as they formulate policies that discriminate against immigrants.
An example of this type of discrimination happened in one healthcare organization where two Hispanic employees were dismissed for speaking Spanish at their place of work. According to the supervisor, the two employees went against the company policy (Lentin, 2011). The employees in this organization are not allowed to speak any other language at their place of work apart from English.
Language prejudices are a sign of hatred and mistrust and many immigrants suffer because of these injustices (Lentin, 2011). Communication problems should be the basis for language discrimination but this is not the case in the U.S. There are some schools in the U.S that do not allow the admission of immigrant students (Lentin, 2011).
There are many cases of open discrimination against immigrants but the authorities in America are not concerned about the suffering that immigrants go through. There have been some efforts towards accommodating the linguistic needs of immigrants but many of them still face language-based discrimination.
In conclusion, discrimination against immigrants is not a new thing in the U.S and is often motivated by the need for Native Americans to maintain their hegemony. Immigrant groups still encounter discrimination because of their linguistic and racial affiliation. Immigrants can not attend certain institutions or work in certain companies because of their identity (Lentin, 2011).
The American government and companies formulate policies that favor native citizens and pay little attention to the concerns of immigrants. The American policies and ideologies should accommodate and tolerate the needs of immigrants as a way of protecting immigrants against discrimination (Lentin, 2011). Legal immigrants should be treated fairly without any kind of discrimination because they play the same role as the native citizens when it comes to nation building.

Workplace Immigrant Discrimination: Opportunities and Challenges
Topics: Challenges, Discrimination Words: 868 Pages: 4 May 9th, 2020
The paper aims at examining an article about the peculiarities of immigrant discrimination in the workplace written by Krings, Johnston, Binggeli, and Maggiori in 2014. The authors introduce two hypotheses about immigrants, identify their roles in local labor markets, and prove that certain cultural, educational, and personal issues are crucial in regards to the question of immigrant groups stereotyping.

It has been already known, and the article reminds the reader again, that immigrant employees may face a number of problems as well as enjoy their benefits when they try to find good jobs.
The article under analysis shows that diversity in organizations is a question for discussions nowadays, and people from different parts of the world try to offer their own suggestions and ideas on how to solve this question, improve working conditions for people with different backgrounds, and prove that immigrant group stereotyping has never to be omitted as it plays an important role for society.
After giving some brief facts about the amount of immigrants in workplaces and identifying Switzerland workers as the main subjects of the research, the authors introduce two main hypotheses using one powerful basis – selective incivility – as subtle interpersonal discrimination.
First, it is stated that immigrants experience workplace incivility more than locals; and second, it is mentioned that French and German immigrants demonstrate the highest rates of workplace incivility in comparison to other immigrant groups (Krings, Johnston, Binggeli, & Maggiori, 2014). To prove the correctness of the chosen hypotheses, Krings et al. share a part of the results of their longitudinal project that support the second hypothesis and do not deny the possibility of the first hypothesis.
The examples from different spheres of life and personal experience prove that people suffer from immigrant group diversity a lot. Workforce integration depends how immigrants are able to meet the demands of the chosen society: language barriers, religious expectations, personal needs, etc. (Xiao, Willis, & Jeffers, 2014). On the one hand, it is clear why immigrants may face challenges while searching work and need additional help.
On the other hand, it seems to be wrong to provide foreigners with work and appropriate salaries at the expense of native workers. This is the claim that has to be mentioned: local workers should not suffer because of the support of foreign workers.

This is why it is hard to decide whether it is wrong or right that immigrants suffer from workplace incivility and whether it is necessary to solve this problem. The authors of the article do not focus on solving the problem but prove that it does exist and explain what factors may influence the chosen diversity.
The results of the research introduced in the article show that immigrants may experience more incivility than locals, still, not all immigrants as it is mentioned in the first hypothesis. At the same type, the partial support of this hypothesis provides the whole support of another hypothesis concerning French and German immigrants and their relation to incivility in comparison to the representatives of other nationalities.
It is possible to suggest that a geographic issue is also crucial for the immigrants-at-workplace issue: when neighbor countries share their workers, immigrant workers are usual for society, and the question of working challenges is not as vital for these immigrants as for the immigrants from the other countries. At the same time, the demand of foreign workers with new fresh ideas from far countries plays an important role as well.
Organizations want to have unique workers with a unique experience. This is why hostile work environment may become a problem for many workers, both immigrants and locals, and the main task is to think about appropriate working conditions in general and offer successful management neglecting the challenges of such processes like globalization or immigration (Canas & Sondak, 2014).
The article is also a powerful source of information on how it is necessary to define immigrant groups of workers and overcome the challenges of diversity at any cost. There are the cases when countries are in need of immigrant working force as the only possible chance to avoid shortages of skilled labor.
If immigrants are well-educated and demonstrate good intentions in regards to working places they can get, they have to be appreciated. Managers want to find good workers for their organizations, and they do not pay attention whether these workers are immigrants or not. However, for some companies, the question of immigration remains to be burning, and treatment to such workers varies.
In general, the article chosen introduces clear facts about immigrant group stereotyping and helps to realize that workers may face some problems at work places being immigrants or locals. Of course, the question of immigration does play a certain role in working processes, still, if companies focus on success, they use immigrants to achieve better results. Though it is not always possible to find a good immigrant worker, this task may be achieved.

Worker discrimination may become a problem and a real challenge; still, it may be explained due to the necessity to appreciate and promote local workers and solved under the control of skilled managers and rational workers and used as a good change for changes and improvements.

Discrimination Against Immigrants in the Workplace | McOmber McOmber Luber
Discrimination Against Immigrants in the Workplace
Fighting Discrimination Against Immigrants in the Workplace in NJ
The United States is often called a nation of immigrants, and this is also true in the workplace, as people born outside the country made up 17.4% of the labor force in 2019. However, discrimination against immigrants in the workplace continues to be a common problem. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 9.6% of the complaints they received (7,009 cases) for employment discrimination in 2019 involved national origin. Fortunately, there are state and federal laws in place to help protect New Jersey employees against immigrant discrimination.
With offices in Red Bank, NJ, and Marlton, NJ, McOmber McOmber & Luber, P.C. represents both employees and employers throughout the state in a wide range of employment discrimination matters, including immigrant discrimination. Our discrimination attorneys will provide you with a clear and candid evaluation of any potential claims, as well as all legal options available to you.
Federal Laws Against Immigrant Discrimination
There are several federal laws in place to protect immigrants from employment discrimination, including:
The Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – strictly prohibits employers from discriminating against current and potential employees on the basis of their race, color, or national origin.
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) – prohibits employers from discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status against US citizens, US nationals, authorized aliens, or permanent residents.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) – makes it illegal to harass or treat an employee or applicant differently due to citizenship or immigration status.
New Jersey State Protections Against Immigrant Discrimination
In addition to federal protections, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD) protects employees and job applicants from any unfair or adverse treatment. While the NJLAD does not specifically mention immigration or citizenship status as a protected classification, it does protect against discrimination based on national origin, color, race, nationality, ancestry, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, or genetic information. Immigrants facing discrimination in the workplace can seek protection under the NJLAD based on these classifications.
Before filing a claim, we recommend contacting us to discuss your situation and assess your legal protections under state and federal laws.
What Constitutes Discrimination Against Immigrants in the Workplace?
Federal and state law prohibits discrimination against immigrants, and on the basis of national origin, in all employment-related matters, including:
Termination or Demotion
Failure to Recruit or Hire
Differential Treatment or Pay
Withholding Training, Promotions or Career Advancement
Being Subjected to Harassment or Increased Scrutiny
The Existence of a Hostile Work Environment with Severe and Pervasive Harassment
Terminating or Disciplining an Employee in Retaliation for Making a Complaint
An individual may file a discrimination claim if he or she was treated unfairly on the basis of her national origin, race, color, creed, ethnicity, or accent. It is also illegal for an employer to discriminate against current or potential employees because the person:
Displays the physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a particular ethnic group;
Identifies with, belongs, or is perceived to belong to a particular ethnicity or national group;
Has a foreign accent in a position where that accent would not affect job functionality;
Attends a school or religious space, such as a church or temple, that is associated with a particular ancestry;
Belongs to an organization that is associated with a specific ethnicity or culture;
Has a surname associated with an ethnicity or culture; and/or
Is married to or associates with persons of a particular nationality or ethnicity.
Discrimination against immigrants also often overlaps with other forms of employment discrimination, including:
Racial Discrimination
Color Discrimination
Ancestry Discrimination
Genetic Discrimination
Religious Discrimination
Hairstyle Discrimination
Language Discrimination
Language Discrimination
Teasing or harassing an employee due to their accent or fluency in English is illegal. Additionally, discriminating against an employee on those grounds, even if it does not create a hostile work environment by the definition of the law, may give rise to a discrimination claim.
English-only Rules. These rules are generally regarded as discriminatory because they have the potential to limit an individual’s employment opportunities and may contribute to an atmosphere of intimidation and isolation. However, English-only rules may be permissible if the employer can demonstrate that the rule is a business necessity.
English fluency. This can only affect one’s employment if it is required for the performance of the position.
Accent discrimination. Teasing, harassing, or making an employment decision based on an employee’s or job applicant’s accent, when it does not affect the ability to perform a job, is discriminatory and therefore illegal.
Is it Legal For An Employer to Ask About Immigration Status?
An employer cannot ask you about your immigration or citizenship status during the interview process. However, employers are required to verify the identity and employment eligibility of any new hires. Employees must follow the same process for every hire – requiring additional documentation from employees they believe to be an immigrant is illegal.
Employers are not allowed to institute a ‘US citizen only’ hiring policy. They can only require US citizenship for a position if it is required by law or by government contract.
An Experienced NJ Immigrant Discrimination Lawyer Can Help You
Before filing a complaint under the NJLAD or federal law, employees who feel they have been the victim of discrimination against immigrants in the workplace should first contact McOmber McOmber & Luber, P.C. to discuss your rights and options.

Okay, so from these search results, it's clear that discrimination against immigrants in the workplace is a real issue. Immigrants face challenges such as being paid less, having fewer opportunities for advancement, and experiencing harassment or a hostile work environment. The reasons behind this discrimination seem to stem from stereotypes and fears about competition for jobs.

One document mentions that immigrants are often seen as taking jobs away from native-born Americans, especially during economic downturns. However, another source points out that immigrants often take on jobs that native-born Americans are less willing to do, such as manual labor or agricultural work. So, there's a complexity here—immigrants are both valued for filling certain roles and resented for allegedly taking jobs.

Moreover, language barriers can lead to discrimination. Some employers implement "English-only" policies or discriminate against those with accents, even if their communication doesn't impede job performance. This suggests that there's a cultural bias at play, where anything perceived as non-standard or foreign is viewed negatively.

But it's not all negative. Some sources mention that immigrants bring valuable skills and diversity to the workplace, which can benefit companies and the economy as a whole. There are also laws in place, like the Immigration and Nationality Act and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, that aim to protect immigrants from employment discrimination.

So, while there are legal protections and some认可of the benefits immigrants bring, discrimination persists. This raises questions about how effective these laws are in practice and what more can be done to ensure equal treatment in the workplace.

Perhaps I should look into some statistics on immigrant earnings and advancement in the workplace to see if there's a tangible impact of this discrimination.

Immigrants' impact on the U.S. economy in 7 charts

Latest MoneyWatch headlines

The furor over U.S. immigration tends to gloss over one thing: the impact of immigrants on the U.S. economy. About 25 million immigrants are working in the country today, filling jobs from programming to construction. (That figure includes legal immigrants, temporary residents, refugees and undocumented immigrants, but the data does not distinguish between people in different categories.)
Where do most U.S. immigrants work?
As public debate flares over the conditions for entering the U.S., immigrants remain a major part of the world’s largest economy. Here’s how immigrants living in America today compare with native-born people as gauged by their likelihood of holding a job, earnings and other measures.
Source: OECD; 2014 data.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
1. Immigrants participate in the U.S. labor force at a slightly higher rate than native-born Americans
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calculated the labor force participation rate -- the percentage of working-age adults who are employed or looking for a job -- by counting the number of people in each group (native-born or immigrant) who were either working or looking for a job, relative to the size of that group in the country.
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; 2015 data.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
2. U.S. immigrants earn consistently less than native-born workers
Immigrants’ income gap with people born in the U.S. holds true for both women and men across all age groups. Young immigrants make nearly equal pay to their native-born counterparts, but the gap increases as workers age.
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; 2015 data.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
3. More-educated immigrants earn more than their native-born counterparts
Immigrants with a college degree or higher earn slightly more than native-born workers in the same category -- about 2.8 percent more, according to recent U.S. Labor Department data.
Source: Small Business Administration analysis of 2010 Current Population Survey.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
4. Immigrants are more likely to own businesses than native-born Americans
An analysis from the Small Business Administration found that 10.5 percent of U.S. immigrants own a business, compared with 9.3 percent of native-born Americans. In other words, an individual immigrant is about 10 percent more likely to own a business than a nonimmigrant.
Source: Small Business Administration analysis of 2010 Current Population Survey.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
5. Immigrants start businesses at higher rates
For every 10,000 immigrants to the U.S., about 62 will start a business -- more than double the rate for the native-born.
Source: National Venture Capital Association; 2013 data.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
6. Immigrant business founders have grown more important to the economy over time
Immigrants were involved in founding one-quarter of the companies that went public between 1990 and 2005. Their importance has grown since then: One-third of the companies that went public between 2006 and 2012 had at least one immigrant founder. Of the 87 privately held companies currently valued at over $1 billion, 51 percent had immigrant founders.
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015 data.CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova
7. Immigrants tend to cluster in certain occupations
Compared with people born in the U.S., immigrants are more likely to work in buildings and grounds maintenance, construction, computer, math or science occupations, and jobs in food preparation or service. Native-born workers are more likely to be employed in sales, business and financial operations, office support or social service jobs.

As the first in a trio of articles devoted to incorporating immigration into policy models, this article traces the history of research on immigrant earnings. It focuses on how earnings trajectories of immigrants differ from those of U.S. natives, vary across immigrant groups, and have changed over time. The highlighted findings underscore key lessons for modeling immigrant earnings and pave the way for representing the earnings trajectories of immigrants in policy models.
The authors are with the Division of Economic Research, Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics, Office of Retirement and Disability Policy, Social Security Administration; Duleep is also a Research Professor with the Thomas Jefferson Program in Public Policy, College of William and Mary and a Research Fellow with IZA, Institute for the Study of Labor.
The findings and conclusions presented in the Bulletin are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Social Security Administration.
Summary
As the first in a trio of pieces devoted to incorporating immigration into policy models, this review of research on immigrant earnings trajectories brings to light several findings. Controlling for demographic and human capital characteristics, immigrants often start their U.S. lives at substantially lower earnings, but experience faster earnings growth than natives with comparable years of education and experience. The extent to which the earnings trajectories of immigrants and natives differ varies by country of origin, with the source-country's level of economic development being a key determinant of the size of the U.S. -born/foreign-born difference. The earnings profiles of immigrants from economically developed countries such as Japan, Canada, or Western Europe resemble those of U.S. natives who are of the same age and education level. In contrast, the earnings of immigrants from developing nations tend to start well below those of U.S. natives with comparable education levels and experience, but rise more rapidly than their U.S. counterparts. Comparing the earnings profiles of immigrants of similar age, sex, and years of schooling, over time and across groups, a strong inverse relationship emerges between their initial earnings and their subsequent U.S. earnings growth. In other words, the lower (higher) the initial earnings are, the higher (lower) the earnings growth. These and other research results have important implications for the projection of immigrant earnings and emigration in microsimulation models, as discussed in the two articles following this one: (1) "Adding Immigrants to Microsimulation Models" and (2) "Incorporating Immigrant Flows into Microsimulation Models."
Introduction
Immigration policy in the United States and the source-country composition of U.S. immigration have changed radically over time. Ending a period of high immigration, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 created a system that allocated visas according to the national-origin composition of the late 19th and early 20th century U.S. population, favoring immigration from Western European countries and greatly reducing or eliminating immigration from Asia and Southern and Eastern Europe. 1 With the end of World War II, various changes chipped away at the national origin system and, in 1965, an Immigration and Nationality Act made family reunification, as opposed to national origin, the primary determinant of entry. To a much lesser extent, the new system also made room for persons to enter via employer requests for needed occupational skills. 2 Given differences in the relative economic opportunities between the United States and the countries whose immigration had been severely restricted before 1965, the source-country composition of U.S. immigration shifted. Most recent immigrants come from Asian and Latin American countries in marked contrast to the earlier European-dominated immigration (Table 1).

A perusal of immigration research over the 20th century reveals, not surprisingly, that the extent to which social scientists have studied U.S. immigration follows the ebbs and flows of U.S. immigration. With the restrictive immigration policy of the 1920s and subsequent decline in the number of immigrants entering the United States, immigration lost its luster as an interesting research topic. With the reopening of the U.S. admission gates in the 1960s and subsequent growth in the number of immigrants entering the United States, immigration reemerged as a hot topic. Whenever immigration has been studied, a key focal point for scholars and policy analysts has been, how do immigrants fare in the U.S. labor market? Though on the surface, a simple question, answering it has meant scaling a methodological hurdle: how to discern from the available data the earnings growth of immigrants as they live in the United States.
The first studies measured immigrant earnings growth with a single year of decennial census data, by comparing the earnings of immigrants who had recently arrived with the earnings of immigrants who had been in the U.S. multiple years. Later studies used two censuses: Using more than one census provides information on the earnings growth of the year-of-entry immigrant cohorts that are identified in both censuses. Following this, three censuses were used, permitting an analysis of how changes in the initial earnings of immigrant cohorts are related to changes in their subsequent earnings growth. Most recently, analysts have used longitudinal data to trace the earnings trajectories of the same individuals. The estimates of immigrant earnings growth from these various efforts reflect an interesting historical interplay between how researchers have perceived changes in immigration over time, the methods they have used to measure immigrant earnings growth, and the assumptions behind those methods.
The review of immigrant earnings research that follows reveals key differences between the earnings of the foreign born and U.S. natives, differences among immigrant groups, and changes in these patterns over time. These findings help refine and develop appropriate methods for forecasting immigrant earnings and emigration in policy models—the subject of this article's companion pieces also featured in this issue, "Adding Immigrants to Microsimulation Models" (Duleep and Dowhan 2008a) and "Incorporating Immigrant Flows into Microsimulation Models" (Duleep and Dowhan 2008b).
A Decline in Immigrant Entry Earnings
Following immigration's peak in the early 20th century, 3 a model of immigrant assimilation was spawned in the University of Chicago's sociology department. Most closely associated with the works of Robert E. Park, this model portrayed immigrants' trajectories in the host society and economy as a single process that applied to all immigrants, eventually leading to their cultural and economic assimilation in U.S. society and economy. 4
The theme of immigrant assimilation reemerged following the resurgence of U.S. immigration in the 1960s. Echoing Park's thesis but focusing on labor market outcomes, Chiswick (1978, 1979) theorized that migrants often lack skills specific to their destination country that would permit their home-country human capital to be fully valued in the host-country labor market. In other words, immigrants initially earn less than similarly qualified U.S. natives because the specific skills and knowledge associated with their years of schooling and experience are not valued as much by U.S. employers as are the skills of individuals who were raised and educated in the United States. Assimilation in this context is acquiring specific skills that enable an immigrant to earn on a par with a U.S. native of comparable experience and education.
Immigrants engage in many forms of human capital investment to increase the U.S. labor market value of their home-country human capital. Human capital investment activities include learning English, pursuing various forms of informal and formal U.S. schooling and training, and becoming knowledgeable about U.S. -specific institutions, production methods, and technical terms. The specific "skills" needed to increase the U.S. labor market value of home-country human capital may also include credentials, such as a diploma or training certificate that is recognized by U.S. employers or is needed to perform a particular kind of work in the United States. As English and other U.S. -specific skills or credentials are gained, the value of the immigrant's home-country human capital approaches that of a comparably educated and experienced U.S. native.
Chiswick found empirical support for the assimilation model using a single cross-section of data, such as one year of decennial census data; Chiswick's seminal research was based on 1970 census data.
The census and other surveys that ask when immigrants came to the United States to stay make it possible to identify various "year-of-entry" immigrant cohorts. 5 For instance, with the 1970 census it is possible to identify immigrants who came to the United States in the years 1965–1970,6 1960–1964, 1955–1959, 1950–1954, and before 1950. The 1969 earnings (reported on the 1970 census) of immigrants who entered the United States in the 1965–1970 period can be used as an estimate of the initial earnings of immigrants. The 1969 earnings of immigrants who entered the country in the 1955–1960 period provide an estimate of the earnings that immigrants achieve after living 10–15 years in the United States. The difference in earnings between the recent entrants and the longer-term residents provides a "cross-sectional" estimate of immigrant earnings growth.
With the cross-sectional approach, immigrant earnings growth is generally estimated in an earnings regression, using the cross-sectional variation to statistically measure the relationship between "years since migration" and immigrant earnings, controlling for other variables such as age and years of schooling. A fundamental assumption underlying this approach is that the initial earnings and earnings growth of entering immigrants will mimic the earnings paths of earlier immigrants, controlling for observable characteristics such as education, age, and sex. Studies that have used the cross-sectional methodology estimate high-earnings growth for immigrants, substantially exceeding that of U.S. natives; with time in the United States, the earnings of immigrants approach those of their U.S. -born statistical twins.
In the mid-1980s, the immigrant assimilation picture proffered by Park and Chiswick was shattered. A series of articles by Borjas (1985, 1987, 1992a, 1992b) showed that recent immigrants were starting their U.S. economic lives at much lower earnings than their predecessors. Tracing the earnings of earlier immigrant cohorts across two censuses revealed only modest earnings growth, substantially lower than the cross-sectional prediction of immigrant earnings growth. This is because much of the cross-sectionally measured earnings growth stemmed from linking the lower entry earnings of more recent cohorts with the higher earnings of earlier cohorts, whose initial earnings exceeded those of their successors.
Indeed, a decline in immigrant entry earnings has occurred (Table 2). Male immigrants aged 25–54 in the 1965–1970, 1975–1980, and 1985–1990 entry cohorts earned a declining proportion of the median earnings of native men aged 25–54: In 1969, immigrant men who entered the United States in 1965–1970 earned 65 percent of native men's earnings; in 1989, male immigrants who entered the United States in 1985–1990 earned only 41 percent of their U.S. male counterparts. 7 The lower immigrant entry earnings of the 1975–1980 and 1985–1990 entry cohorts relative to the 1965–1970 cohort persist within age and education categories (Table 2) 8 thus invalidating one of the key assumptions of the cross-sectional approach—constancy in entry earnings across year-of-entry cohorts, once demographic and human capital characteristics are controlled for.

NOTES: Immigrant cohorts are defined by the year they reported to the Census Bureau as the year they came to the United States to stay, which may be after the initial year of U.S. entry. For a discussion of this issue and the effect of various year-of-entry definitions on measuring immigrant earnings growth, see Duleep and Dowhan (2002). Because no labor force status restrictions are placed on the census cohorts, median earnings are computed on samples that include zeros. For a discussion of how limiting the sample to employed persons can affect measures of immigrant economic assimilation in studies that follow immigrant entry cohorts across two or more censuses, refer to Duleep and Regets (2002).
Borjas' research, which highlighted year-of-entry cohort effects, launched a fresh fleet of empirical studies armed with a new methodology for measuring immigrant earnings growth. In this methodology, analysts pool two or more cross sections, such as two decennial census samples, to estimate the earnings path of immigrants. Pooling data from two cross sections, such as two censuses, provides information on earnings at two points in time for each year-of-entry cohort that is identified in both censuses. For instance, using the 1970 and 1980 censuses it is possible to follow over 10 years the earnings of immigrants who immigrated in 1965–1970, 1960–1964, 1955–1959, 1950–1954, and before 1950, since these are the year-of-entry cohorts identified in both censuses. As in the cross-sectional approach, immigrant earnings growth is estimated in an earnings regression by statistically measuring the relationship between years since migration and immigrant earnings, controlling for age and education level. However, the information that informs the estimation of the relationship between earnings and years since migration comes not from a single cross section, but from the 10-year earnings growth of the year-of-entry cohorts that are identified in both censuses. Furthermore, categorical (zero-one) variables are included for each year of entry to capture earnings differences across the year-of-entry cohorts. The addition of the categorical variables (inspired by the fact that recent immigrant cohorts are starting at much lower earnings than earlier cohorts) permits the entry earnings of the immigrant cohorts to change, thus permitting the estimated relationship between years since migration and earnings to begin at different earnings levels.
This methodology, pioneered by Borjas and first estimated with data from two decennial censuses, is now used by many other analysts with other sources of data, including longitudinal data on individuals. It could be called the "stationary earnings growth" approach for estimating immigrant earnings growth because it assumes that the earnings growth rate of year-of-entry immigrant cohorts is constant once observable variables, such as age and education, are accounted for. Assuming the earnings growth rate of earlier cohorts accurately predicts the growth rate of more recent cohorts yields a bleak prognosis of the ability of recent immigrants to assimilate because their initial earnings disadvantage persists unabated.
Chart 1 illustrates some key concepts. The left-hand side presents the cross-sectional methodology for estimating immigrant earnings growth. It shows the earnings that we would observe in a single cross section from census year t. We see the entry earnings of the most recent cohort (point A) and the earnings that the earlier cohort (cohort t -10) achieves after 10 years in the United States (point D). Unobserved, at time t, are the earnings that the earlier cohort of immigrants first received when they came to the United States 10 years ago (point C). By pairing the initial earnings of the recent cohort (cohort t) with the earnings at the 10-year point of the earlier cohort (cohort t -10), the cross-sectional method overestimates the earnings growth of the earlier cohort. The line A-D will accurately represent the earnings trajectory of the more recent cohort only if the earnings growth of this cohort substantially exceeds that of the earlier cohort. Indeed, earnings growth would have to increase so that the recent cohort's earnings catch up to the earlier cohort in 10 years' time.

The right-hand side of Chart 1 illustrates the stationary-earnings-growth methodology for estimating immigrant earnings growth. It shows the earnings that we would observe by pooling data from two decennial censuses, one from census year t, the other from census year t -10. With the addition of the earlier data, we now observe the initial earnings of cohort t -10 (point C). The line C-D is the actual earnings trajectory of this earlier cohort. The line A-B is the projected earnings trajectory of the more recent cohort (cohort t ). It will accurately predict the more recent cohort's earnings if and only if there has been no intercohort change in immigrant earnings growth.
Borjas correctly showed that in a situation where immigrant initial earnings are falling over time, the cross-sectional methodology (pairing the initial earnings of more recent immigrants with the earnings achieved by earlier immigrants after 10–15 years in the country) overstates the earnings growth of the earlier immigrants. However, we cannot deduce from Borjas' finding that the earnings growth of earlier cohorts predicts the earnings growth of more recent cohorts, as is assumed in the stationary-earnings-growth methodology.
Theories about the Decline in Immigrant Entry Earnings
Whether a decline in the initial earnings of immigrants is accompanied by an increase, decrease, or no change in immigrant earnings growth depends on the reason for the decline. Two hypotheses, with opposing predictions about the relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth, have been put forth to explain why the age- and education-adjusted entry earnings of U.S. immigrants declined. One hypothesis (the income distribution–immigrant ability hypothesis) proposes that the decline reflects a decrease in the (labor market) quality of U.S. immigrants. The other hypothesis (the economic development-skills transferability hypothesis) proposes that the decline reflects a decrease in immigrant skill transferability.
The Income Distribution–Immigrant Ability Hypothesis
Borjas theorized that the cause of the decline in immigrants' initial earnings was a decline in the labor market quality of immigrants fueled by an increase in the income inequality of the countries contributing to U.S. immigration (Borjas 1987, 1990, 1992a, 1992b). According to this theory, immigrants coming from countries with greater income inequality than the United States will be selected from the lower tail of the ability distribution in the country of origin, whereas immigrants coming from countries with less income inequality than the United States will be selected from the upper tail of their countries' ability distributions. 9
Borjas (1987, 537) noted that before the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration from Western Europe was dominant in the United States. The national origins quota system, based on the late 19th and 20th centuries' U.S. -ethnic composition, "encouraged immigration from (some) Western European countries and discouraged immigration from all other countries." Measuring income inequality by the ratio of income accruing to the top 10 percent of households to that accruing to the bottom 20 percent, Borjas (1992a, 44) showed that the amount of dispersion in the average immigrant's source country doubled in the postwar period, with most of that increase occurring after 1960. 10 He observed that with the decline of the national origins system,
The new flow of migrants originates in countries that are much more likely to have greater income inequality than the United States. It would not be surprising, therefore, if the [labor market] quality of immigrants declined as a result of the 1965 Amendments. (Borjas 1987, 537)
Although it is theoretically ambiguous whether lower labor market ability leads to initially lower earnings, 11 under any human capital model a decline in immigrant labor market ability would not be associated with an increase in earnings growth. According to the income distribution–immigrant ability explanation for the decline in immigrant entry earnings, immigrant earnings growth should have declined or stayed constant as immigrant entry earnings declined. The method pioneered by Borjas for measuring immigrant earnings growth assumes that immigrant earnings growth remains constant as immigrant entry earnings decline.
The Economic Development-Skills Transferability Hypothesis
An alternative hypothesis for the decline in the education- and age-adjusted entry earnings of immigrants is that it reflects a decline in the extent to which the country-of-origin skills of immigrants transfer to the United States (Duleep and Regets 1997b).
The initial earnings of U.S. immigrants vary enormously depending on where they come from (Chart 2). 12 Immigrants from the source regions that dominate recent U.S. immigration (Asia and Central and South America) initially earn about half or less than half of what U.S. natives earn, whereas the entry earnings of Western European immigrants resemble those of the U.S. born. Moreover, these differences persist within age and education categories (Table 3). 13

A key factor underlying the variation in immigrants' initial U.S. earnings appears to be the source country's level of economic development. Immigrants from regions of the world with levels of economic development similar to the U.S., such as Western Europe and Japan, have initial earnings approaching or exceeding those of comparably educated and experienced U.S. natives. Those hailing from economically developing countries have low initial earnings relative to their U.S. -born counterparts. When the median 1989 U.S. earnings of immigrant men who entered the United States in the 1985–1990 period is plotted against the 1987 per adult gross domestic product (GDP) of each source country, 14 a positive relationship between immigrant entry earnings and level of economic development emerges (Chart 3). 15

Though Borjas focused on an increase in the inequality of U.S. immigrant source countries, post-1965 immigrants are also more likely to come from countries that are less economically developed relative to the United States than was true of earlier cohorts (Reimers 1996). 16 This decrease in the economic development of the countries contributing to U.S. immigration could have contributed to a decline in immigrant skill transferability. That is, it could have contributed to a decline in the extent to which immigrant home-country education and experience is valued in the U.S. labor market.
Two conceptualizations link immigrant skill transferability to the level of economic development of immigrants' countries of origin. One suggests that source-country variations in immigrants' initial earnings stem from variations in the skills learned by growing up and working in different source countries (Chiswick 1978, 1979; Mincer and Ofek 1982). Holding constant the level of human capital (years of schooling and work experience), the skills of immigrants hailing from economically developed countries transfer more easily to the U.S. because these countries and the U.S. share similar educational systems, industrial structures, and labor market reward structures; the skills of immigrants from economically less-developed countries are less transferable to the United States (initially resulting in lower U.S. earnings) because the formal education and work experience in these countries are less applicable to the U.S. labor market.
The other conceptualization links immigrant skill transferability to the level of economic development of immigrants' home countries via an opportunity selection mechanism (Duleep and Regets 1997b). According to this conceptualization, immigrants from less-developed countries have lower skill transferability because the limited opportunities in less-developed countries make it worthwhile for them to migrate even when immigration entails substantial post-migration investments in new skills and credentials such as learning English, undertaking a U.S. degree program, or starting a business; their equivalents in economically developed countries would only migrate if there were positions for them in the United States that immediately valued their source-country skills and they did not have to invest in new human capital, whether it be learning English or undertaking additional training.
The opportunity selection explanation for variations in the skill transferability of immigrants accommodates otherwise inexplicable intergroup patterns of English proficiency and entry earnings. Reflecting India's British colonial history, the English proficiency of Asian Indian immigrants far surpasses that of non-British European immigrants (Table 4). Yet the initial earnings of Asian Indians in the United States are low relative to those of European immigrants, particularly when intergroup variations in educational achievement are held constant (second data row, Table 4). Filipino immigrants are more proficient in English than their non-British European counterparts, yet have lower initial earnings. Conversely, the initial earnings of Japanese immigrant men are very high, despite their very low English proficiency. 17 The entry earnings of Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, and Chinese immigrants are similar despite enormous variation in their English proficiency (Table 4). Of those entering the United States from 1975 to 1980, only 24 percent of the Chinese and 15 percent of the Koreans reported speaking English very well compared with 69 percent of Asian Indian men and 51 percent of Filipino men. The similarity in their entry earnings is not surprising, however, if intergroup differences in skill transferability stem from variations in immigrant selection based on intercountry differences in economic opportunity: The common link among these countries is a low level of economic opportunity relative to the United States.

b. To compare the earnings of the various immigrant groups, group-specific regressions were estimated in which the natural logarithm of earnings was regressed on the following explanatory variables: level of schooling (a three-part spline), age, age squared, age x education, years since migration, education x years since migration, marital status, metropolitan status, and regions of residence. Using the estimated coefficients from the group-specific earnings regressions, we simulated the earnings profiles of each immigrant group. To provide a benchmark by which the earnings of each immigrant group could be compared, we also simulated the earnings growth of American-born, non-Hispanic white men. Each simulation begins at age 28, which for immigrants we also held constant as the age at migration. The estimates in the table show the ratio immigrant to native earnings evaluated at one year after migration. In these estimations, years of schooling, marital status, metropolitan status, and region of residence are held constant at the mean values of the U.S. -born white men. These group-specific analyses are from Duleep and Regets (1992b).
It is not necessarily the language of the sending country that determines immigrants' initial earnings in the United States, or even the language proficiency of those who migrate. Rather, persons who migrate from economically developed countries will tend to be persons with U.S. positions not requiring additional human capital investment. The opportunity selection argument also accommodates findings that the quality of education in some less economically developed countries is not inferior to that in the United States, and may be superior (Rivera-Batiz 1996). Rather than the skills learned in less-developed countries being less applicable to the United States, economic conditions in those countries make it worthwhile for persons to immigrate even when they lack skills that immediately transfer to the U.S. labor market.
Immigrant Skill Transferability and the Propensity to Invest in Human Capital
Regardless of what is behind a decline in immigrant skill transferability, a decline in the initial earnings of immigrants caused by a decline in immigrant skill transferability should be accompanied by an increase in earnings growth. This prediction flows from two basic concepts of a simple Immigrant Human Capital Investment (IHCI) model (Duleep and Regets 2002, 1999). First, immigrants whose home-country skills transfer poorly to the U.S. labor market will, by virtue of their lower wages, have a lower opportunity cost of human capital investment than natives or immigrants with high skill transferability. That is, the time they spend learning new skills, instead of applying their current skills to earning, is less costly than it is for high skill transferability immigrants or natives who earn more with the same level of education and experience. Second, the source-country human capital that is not valued in the U.S. labor market is still useful for learning new skills. There are several reasons for this (Duleep and Regets 2002):
Part of the difficulty in transferring human capital between the labor markets of countries is a matter of information costs and risks. It can be much harder for potential employers to evaluate foreign educational credentials and work experience. However, even if employers have difficulty evaluating immigrant human capital, those skills are still useful in gaining new skills. 18
Learning skills—the set of abilities and experiences that aid in gaining new knowledge and skills—should transfer more readily than skills more specifically related to the business and production practices in the origin and destination countries. Those with home-country skills have learned how to learn; previously learned work and study habits may greatly facilitate the learning of destination-country skills.
Similarity and common elements between old and new skills aid learning. Although the technologies in producing goods and services differ across countries—particularly between developed and less-developed countries—the processes, materials, and ultimate aims are analogous. Thus, skills acquired in a less-developed source country are useful for learning skills in a more-developed destination country: A Cambodian carpenter's experience with a hand saw is useful in learning to use an electric saw. More generally, persons who have learned one set of skills—even if those skills are not valued in the destination-country labor market—have advantages in learning a new set of skills. Cognitive psychologists refer to this phenomenon as "transfer".
The lower opportunity cost of human capital investment for immigrants lacking skills that immediately transfer to the U.S. labor market combined with the usefulness of the undervalued human capital for creating new human capital creates a greater incentive for low-skill-transferability immigrants to invest in human capital than would be true of either high-skill-transferability immigrants or natives with similar levels of education and experience (Duleep and Regets 1999, 1994a, 2002). Because greater human capital investment fuels greater earnings growth, the IHCI model predicts that immigrants will experience higher earnings growth than natives, and among immigrants, there will be an inverse relationship between entry earnings and earnings growth. 19 Immigrants whose skills initially transfer poorly to the United States will have lower initial earnings but higher earnings growth than natives or immigrants with similar levels of education and experience, but with highly transferable skills.
An implication of the IHCI model is that a decline in immigrant entry earnings caused by a decline in immigrant skill transferability will be accompanied by an increase in earnings growth. This prediction holds regardless of whether skill-transferability variations arise from variations in the skills learned in immigrants' countries of origin (as proposed by Chiswick) or from an opportunity-driven selection of immigrants (as proposed by Duleep and Regets), or both. However, an implication of the opportunity-selection theory is that immigrants will be more likely than natives to invest in human capital in general, not just human capital that restores their original human capital.
Empirical Evidence on the Relationship Between Immigrant Entry Earnings and Earnings Growth
Several different approaches have been used to measure the relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth.
Using Census Data to Measure the Relationship
Without imposing any restrictions on either entry earnings or earnings growth, Duleep and Regets (1994a, 1994b, 1997b, 2002) followed country-of-origin/age/education cohorts of immigrants across the 1960 through 1980 and 1970 through 1990 decennial censuses. 20 For instance, using the 1980 census, they measured the 1979 earnings of immigrants, ages 25–54, who entered the United States in the 1975–1980 period. 21 Using the 1990 census, they measured the 1989 earnings of the same cohort of immigrants—those who entered the United States in the 1975–1980 period and were ages 35–64 in 1990. Similarly, using the 1970 and 1980 censuses, they measured the entry earnings and earnings after 10 to 14 years of U.S. residence of immigrants who entered the country in the 1965–1970 period. They also measured the earnings of comparably aged U.S. natives to provide estimates of relative immigrant earnings growth. 22
Duleep and Reget's analyses show that as immigrants' entry earnings decreased over time, their earnings growth increased. Despite a 23.4 percent drop in the initial earnings relative to the native born between the 1965–1970 and the 1975–1980 immigrant entry cohorts, there is very little difference in the relative earnings of each cohort after 10 to 14 years of U.S. residence—85.4 percent for the 1965–1970 cohort and 83.9 percent for the 1975–1980 cohort (Table 5). This is because the more recent cohort, with lower relative entry earnings, had a much higher earnings growth rate. The effect is even more dramatic when separating into age and education groups. In each case, the cohort with lower relative entry earnings surpassed the initially higher-earning immigrant cohort in relative earnings. 23 This suggests an inverse relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth. 24

Duleep and Regets also examined the relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth across groups, again finding that within age/education groups, the lower the entry earnings, the higher the earnings growth. Dividing countries of origin according to level of economic development, they found that immigrants coming from less economically developed regions of the world have lower entry earnings but higher earnings growth than immigrants of similar age and education coming from economically developed countries. Finally, Duleep and Regets find a strong inverse relationship between the entry earnings of immigrants and their earnings growth over time for the same country. 25
Evidence from Longitudinal Data
Analyses, such as those of Duleep and Regets, which follow year-of-entry immigrant cohorts across decennial censuses could reflect immigrant emigration and changes in census coverage over time. To circumvent problems with changing cohort composition, Duleep and Dowhan (2002) used longitudinal Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings data matched to the 1994 March Current Population Survey (CPS) to follow the annual earnings of the same working-age foreign- and native-born men, from multiple year-of-immigration cohorts, over time. 26 Using the longitudinal data on individuals, Duleep and Dowhan (2000) also measured the earnings trajectories of immigrant women.
The left-hand side of Table 6 shows the foreign- to native-born earnings ratios at the first year following the CPS -defined year of immigration, and 10 years later. The results adjusting for differences in age and education between the foreign and native born are to the right of the unadjusted results. These results show that the initial earnings of immigrant men have generally fallen over time in relation to native-born men, a decline that persists when evaluating native-born earnings at each foreign-born cohort's age and education distribution. Foreign-born men who immigrated in the 1960–1964 period earned on a par with U.S. natives; those who immigrated in the 1965–1969 period earned only 17 percent less than their U.S. -born statistical twins; and those who immigrated after 1969 earned 28 percent to 46 percent below the earnings of comparable natives, with an unadjusted foreign-born deficit ranging from 38 percent to 51 percent. The data on women tell a similar story: The entry earnings of the pre-1980 foreign-born cohorts equal or exceed the earnings of their U.S. -born counterparts; for the post-1979 cohorts, a 23 percent to 29 percent unadjusted, and 19 percent to 24 percent adjusted, earnings deficit emerges.

b. The first year is defined as the year following the CPS -defined period of entry.
At the 10-year mark, substantial earnings convergence occurs because as the relative entry earnings of immigrants have fallen, their relative earnings growth has generally increased. When we examine ratios of foreign-born to U.S. -born earnings growth rates we see that the growth rates of the early cohorts of immigrant men equal or closely approximate those of U.S. -born men (the right-hand side of Table 6). 27 Then, starting with the 1970–1974 cohort, the earnings growth rates exceed those of the U.S. born. 28 Echoing the results for immigrant men, immigrant women show declining entry earnings and increasing earnings growth. The earnings growth rates of immigrant women range from equaling those of U.S -born women, to surpassing them. However, the transformation occurs later for immigrant women than it does for immigrant men; starting with the 1980–1981 cohort, foreign-born women have higher-earnings growth than their U.S. counterparts. 29
Chart 4, which illustrates the unadjusted and adjusted growth-rate ratios from Table 6, underscores two key points: (1) post-1969 immigrants tend to have faster earnings growth than natives; and (2) for both men and women the earnings growth of immigrants, relative to natives, has increased in recent years, as the relative entry earnings of immigrants has decreased. 30

The analysis is repeated in the bottom panel of the chart, but adjusts for foreign-born/native-born differences in age and education. This chart highlights another important point—although immigrant earnings profiles have changed dramatically over time, the adjusted earnings profiles of recent, post-1980, immigrant cohorts are remarkably similar.

Age at Entry, Education, and Interactive Effects
Relative to natives, the entry earnings of immigrants with a high school education or less are lower for those who enter the United States at older working ages compared with those who enter at younger working ages. This relationship holds for each entry cohort (Table 2) and across regions of origin (Table 3).
For adult immigrants younger than age 40, education's effect on earnings is most apparent in the long run. This finding emerges by comparing, at entry and 10 years later, the earnings ratio of immigrants with more than 12 years of schooling to those with 12 years or less. For both the cohorts who entered the United States in the 1965–1970 and 1975–1980 periods, the beneficial effect of education on earnings increases markedly with length of time in the country for immigrants from all source regions (Table 7). Among immigrants in the more recent cohort, the initial earnings of the more-educated immigrants exceed the earnings of less-educated immigrants by 30 percent. Ten years later, the earnings of the more educated are double those of the less educated.

There may also be interactive effects between skill transferability and education that influence how education affects the propensity to invest in human capital. 31 In most human capital models, prior education or experience has an ambiguous effect upon investment decisions: An increase in an individual's education increases the opportunity cost of time spent in human capital investment, but it will also most likely increase the productivity of that time. In the IHCI model, source-country human capital that is not valued in the destination-country labor market is still useful in gaining new skills. Because low skill transferability reduces the opportunity cost of human capital investment more than it reduces its productivity, the lower the degree of skill transferability, the greater the likelihood that highly educated immigrants will invest more than poorly educated immigrants. If natives are the special case of perfect skill transferability, we would expect education to have a more positive effect on further human capital investment for immigrants than for natives; the lower the skill transferability of immigrants, the more this would be true. Consistent with these theoretical expectations, Duleep and Regets (2002) find that the earnings growth of the more educated versus the less educated is higher among immigrants coming from economically developing countries than it is for immigrants coming from economically developed countries.
Conclusion: Research Findings on Immigrant Earnings Trajectories
This article highlights variations, over time and across groups, in immigrant-earnings patterns.
For immigrants, as with U.S. natives, human capital (often measured by age and years of schooling) affects earnings. Thus in efforts to model immigrant earnings—the topic of the next two articles—variables that are relevant to modeling the earnings of U.S. natives are also relevant to modeling the earnings of U.S. immigrants.
In addition, the degree to which human capital transfers to the U.S. labor market affects the earnings of immigrants. If the human capital that immigrants possess transfers easily to the U.S. labor market, immigrant earnings profiles resemble those of similarly educated and experienced U.S. natives. The less home-country skills transfer to the U.S. labor market, the lower the initial earnings of immigrants, relative to otherwise similar U.S. natives, but the higher their earnings growth—a phenomenon that likely reflects a higher propensity to invest in U.S. human capital.
A key predictor of immigrant skill transferability, hence immigrants' initial and subsequent earnings, is the source country's level of economic development. Immigrants from countries with economic opportunities resembling those in the U.S. tend to have earnings profiles resembling those of U.S. natives. Immigrants from economically developing countries tend to have earnings profiles with lower initial earnings, but higher earnings growth than otherwise similar U.S. natives. Indeed the level of economic development of an immigrant's source country is so important that it can sometimes trump what one would otherwise consider an essential predictor of immigrants' initial earnings—proficiency in English. The source country's level of economic development also appears to influence the relationship between an immigrant's level of education and earnings growth.
Immigrant earnings profiles have changed over time. As the country-of-origin mix of U.S. immigration shifted from primarily European and Canadian to primarily Asian and Hispanic, immigrant entry earnings decreased and earnings growth increased, a transformation that persists within age and education categories. This transformation most likely reflects an increase in the proportion of immigrants from economically developing countries and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of immigrants with skills that immediately transfer to the U.S. labor market. Moreover, even for the same countries of origin, immigrant-earnings profiles have changed with the passage of time. Such within-country transformations most likely reflect changes in the relative economic conditions of source countries relative to the United States as well as responses to U.S. -admission policy changes. 32
Holding age and years of schooling constant, a persistent pattern emerges regardless of whether immigrant earnings patterns are analyzed over time, or across groups, or both: There is a strong inverse relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth. The inverse relationship yields several implications for estimating immigrant earnings growth.
In situations where immigrant entry earnings (adjusted for age and education) are changing, the inverse relationship invalidates both the cross-sectional and stationary-earnings-growth methods for estimating immigrant earnings growth. In a situation where the adjusted entry earnings of immigrants are falling (as has occurred in the post-1950 United States), the inverse relationship implies that the stationary-earnings-growth method will underestimate the earnings growth of recent cohorts, whereas the cross-sectional method will overestimate the earnings growth of earlier immigrant cohorts. The fact that the cross-sectional method provides accurate estimates for recent immigrant cohorts reflects the fact that as immigrant entry earnings have fallen, earnings growth has increased to such an extent that the adjusted earnings of recent immigrants after 10 to 15 years in the United States closely approximate the earnings, at the 10- to 15-year mark, of earlier immigrants. Despite considerable variation over time in the age- and education-adjusted initial earnings of immigrants, when measured after 10 to 15 years in the United States, the adjusted earnings of immigrants show little change.
In the articles that follow this one (Duleep and Dowhan 2008a, 2008b), these findings and insights are used to help guide the representation of immigrant-earnings trajectories and emigration patterns in policy models.
Notes
1. Various laws, enacted in several years, worked to exclude almost all immigration from Asia. For a synopsis, refer to Duleep (1988, Chapter 2). There was also a preference system in place that allocated quota visas among applicants on the basis of occupational skills (see Hutchinson 1981): Among immigrants from Eastern Hemisphere countries, half of all visas were granted on the basis of occupational skills.
2. The occupational skills classification included two components: (1) workers, skilled and unskilled, in occupations for which labor is deemed scarce in the United States; and (2) professionals, scientists, and artists of exceptional ability. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased occupation-based admissions from 54,000 to 140,000 a year. It also placed a ceiling of 10,000 on unskilled workers within the occupation-based admissions, and it imposed an education requirement on a lottery program increasing admissions from countries "adversely affected" by the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965. These reforms were not sufficient, however, to alter the essentially family-based nature of U.S. immigration (Lowell 1996).
3. For information on the numbers of legal immigrants by decade, refer to the companion piece to this article—"Adding Immigrants to Microsimulation Models," (Duleep and Dowhan 2008a).
4. See, for instance, Park, Miller, and Thompson (1921) and Park's (1950) collected works published posthumously and edited by Everett Hughes.
5. The term "year of entry" is used throughout this article even though Duleep and Dowhan (2002)—and earlier papers by them using matched survey and Social Security data—show that people may have worked in the United States before the year they reported to the survey as being their year of immigration. The census and CPS ask immigrants, "When did you come to stay in the U.S. ?" as opposed to "When did you first come to the U.S. ?" As shown in Duleep and Dowhan (2002), the question asking about intent to stay does appear to yield information on permanence, which is an important determinant of immigrant earnings profiles. The conclusions reached in this article persist regardless of whether year of entry is defined by an immigrant's first earnings in the United States or by the year given as a response to the "when-did-you-come-to-stay" question (Duleep and Dowhan 2002).
6. Note that 1965–1970 refers to 1965 through April 1970, when the 1970 census was taken. This detail, which is true  for any given census's most recent year-of-immigration period, will be assumed throughout the article when we refer to the year-of-immigration period that includes the census year.
7. To an unknown extent, the reported annual earnings for the year preceding the census reflect earnings gained abroad or incomplete annual earnings for immigrants who entered the United States during the year. Conclusions concerning changes in the entry earnings of immigrant cohorts will be unaffected if the rate of immigrant entry within the census year-of-migration categories is similar across the entry cohorts considered.
8. The 1969 to 1989 decline across year-of-entry cohorts within the age/education categories is not continuous for all of the age/education groups. There is a continuous decline in relative earnings for the group aged 40–54 with 1–12 years of schooling. For the other three age/education groups, there is a slight increase from 1979 to 1989. Refer to Fix and Passel (1994) and Simon and Akbari (1995) for analyses of trends in the educational attainment of immigrants. Both studies show that although immigrant education levels have risen in recent years, the increase for immigrants was somewhat less than the corresponding increase for natives.
9. When countries have relatively egalitarian income distributions, as discussed in Borjas (1992b, 429), "…the source country in effect 'taxes' able workers and 'insures' the least productive against poor labor market outcomes. This situation obviously generates incentives for the most able to migrate to the U.S. and the immigrant flow is positively selected.… Conversely, if the source country offers relatively high rates of return to skills (which is typically true in countries with substantial income inequality…), the United States now taxes the most able and subsidizes the least productive. Economic conditions in the U.S. relative to those in the country of origin become a magnet for individuals with relatively low earnings capacities, and the immigrant flow is negatively selected."
10. In an empirical test of the income distribution–immigrant ability thesis, Borjas (1987) found the extent of income inequality of source countries to be negatively associated with the relative quality of U.S. immigrants, as measured by the wage differential between entering immigrants and natives of the same education level. A potential specification error of the empirical test of the income distribution–immigrant ability thesis is that the relevant distribution for a potential emigrant, in an analysis that focuses on immigrant earnings controlling for education, is the earnings distribution associated with that person's level of education, not the income distribution of the entire country, which was used in the empirical analysis (Borjas 1987). This would not be a problem if there was a high correlation between the overall income distribution of a country and the income distribution that individuals with specific levels of education face. Yet, the overall earnings distributions of countries may have little relationship to the earnings distributions of individuals with specific levels of education. To give an example, a country with a large proportion of illiterates and a large proportion of Ph.D. 's would have an extremely unequal income distribution relative to the overall income distribution of the United States. Yet, the earnings distribution of Ph.D. 's might be narrower in that country than the earnings distribution of American Ph.D. 's. In such a case, it would be the higher quality Ph.D. 's that would have the most to gain by migrating to a country that would reward their higher abilities.
11. If all factors remain unchanged, higher ability individuals would theoretically be expected to invest in more human capital than lower ability individuals, which would lower the initial earnings of the higher ability group.
12. Chart 1 shows by country of origin the 1989 median initial earnings of working-age immigrant men who entered the United States between 1985 and 1990. The 1989 median earnings estimates for the 1985–1990 cohort shown in the chart are based on a 6 percent microdata sample created by combining and reweighting the 1990 Census of Population 5 percent and Public-Use 1 percent samples. Technical documentation may be found for the 1990 census data in Census Bureau (1992).
13. Asian immigration is dominated by immigration from less-developed countries. In Table 3, Asia includes Japan.
14. The 1987 per adult GDP of each source country is shown as a percent of the U.S. per adult GDP. The observations in Chart 3 on U.S. median earnings for immigrant men and GDP per adult as a percent of U.S. GDP per adult are for the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, France, West Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR ), United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. All countries for which we had information on the GDP per adult were included. Median earnings for immigrant men in the 1985–1990 cohort from the 65 countries listed above were estimated using a 6 percent microdata sample created by combining and reweighting the 1990 Census of Population 5 percent and Public-Use 1 percent samples. The statistics on GDP per adult as a percent of U.S. GDP per adult are from Heston and Summers (1991).
15. When the median 1989 entry earnings of immigrant men in the 1985–1990 cohort are regressed on source-country GDP, the estimated coefficient indicates that the initial earnings of immigrant men increase $2,280 for each 10 percentage-point change in the country-of-origin GDP measure. The R 2 for this regression is .48.
16. Borjas (1992a, 44) notes, "The changing national origin mix of successive immigrant waves cut by more than half the per capita GNP of the country represented by the typical immigrant, with most of this decline occurring after 1960."
17. Cobb-Clark (2004) also finds "anomalous" results indicating no relationship between English language proficiency and labor market employment experience among a recent cohort of Australian immigrants.
18. In addition, individuals' superior knowledge of their own abilities will be used in making their human capital investment decisions.
19. The Duleep/Regets Immigrant Human Capital Investment (IHCI) model is conditional on initial levels of human capital, as measured by education and age. Empirically, they find evidence of a very strong inverse relationship between initial earnings and earnings growth conditional on education and age, as well as an unconditional relationship that generally holds up.
20. In describing their methodology Duleep and Regets (2002) write, "Median earnings were measured within education and age subsets for 24 countries or regions of origin. (Median rather than mean earnings were used since the median is a much less volatile measure of central tendency in small samples.)  Entry earnings were measured by the earnings reported in 1980 by the 1975–1980 entry cohort. The earnings growth rate of each of the country, age, and education groups was then measured by the difference between their 1980 earnings and their respective earnings 10 years later, as measured by the 1990 census, dividing the difference by their 1980 earnings. An alternative approach would be to first estimate a parametric model and then, using the predicted values, estimate the correlation between the predicted entry earnings and predicted earnings growth. Although our approach ignores information beyond the median within each age/education/country cell, we can be very certain that our results are not the product of a particular set of model assumptions."
21. Refer to note 5.
22. Attrition is a problem in all analyses that follow individuals or cohorts over time. Although we can assume that the mortality of the foreign and native born is similar, attrition as a result of emigration will affect the foreign born far more than the native born. For an analysis of determinants of foreign-born emigration from the United States and reviews of other related research, refer to Duleep (1994) and Ahmed and Robinson (1994).
23. Although these results suggest that the earnings of recent immigrants approach those of natives, they do not imply that the earnings of recent immigrants, will on average, exceed those of natives. According to the IHCI model, the incentive for human capital investment decreases with age and as source-country human capital becomes more transferable; it suggests that the strength of the inverse relationship between initial earnings and earnings growth decreases with immigrant time in the United States. This theoretical expectation is supported in research following immigrants for 20 years. Duleep and Regets (2002) found that although the inverse relationship continues beyond the initial 10-year period (the earnings growth increase associated with lower initial earnings continues beyond the initial 10-year period), it is about one-third of the 10-year effect. The decrease in the ratio of immigrant-to-native earnings growth rates is also apparent in the longitudinal data discussed in the section "Evidence from Longitudinal Data" below.
24. This strong inverse relationship between relative entry earnings for an immigrant cohort and its subsequent relative earnings growth rate has been explored theoretically and empirically in a number of recent papers (Duleep and Regets 1992, 1994a, 1994b, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1997a, 1997b, 1999, 2002).
25. Their finding of a strong inverse relationship persists even when several methodological concerns are taken into account. In Duleep and Regets (1994a, 2002) a simple method to completely circumvent regression-to-the-mean bias in cohort analyses of entry earnings and earnings growth is introduced and used. In Duleep and Regets (1994a, 1994b, 2002), a method for testing the sensitivity of the estimated inverse relationship to the effects of emigration is introduced and applied.
26. Refer to Duleep and Dowhan (1999a, 1999b, 2002) for earlier analyses using the Social Security matched longitudinal data focused on the trend in foreign- and native-born earnings growth and the diverse ways these data can be used to study immigrant economic assimilation.
27. The ratios are defined as [(Y 10 - Y 1/ )/Y 1] F/ [(Y 10 - Y 1 )/Y 1]N where Y 1 and Y 10 denote the beginning- and end-year earnings, and F and N denote foreign and native born.
28. These foreign- and native-born differences in earnings growth rates are statistically significant at a .05 level. The 1984–1985 and 1986–1987 cohorts are exceptions to the pattern of increasing earnings growth, possibly reflecting the newly legalized Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) immigrants, as well as relatively high unemployment rates for these years.
29. These differences are statistically significant at a .05 level.
30. As discussed in note 23, the empirical fact of faster earnings growth for recent immigrants does not imply that recent immigrants will eventually surpass the wages of the native born. Theoretically, one would expect the relative earnings growth advantage of the foreign born to the native born to be highest in the initial years of earning in the United States and to decrease with time in the country. This is borne out empirically. Dividing time of earning between first 5 years, and 5 years and beyond (as illustrated in Charts 5 and 6), one can see that the slope of the foreign- and native-born median earnings lines decreases with immigrant time in the United States.
31. The IHCI model (Duleep and Regets 1999, 2002) predicts that both age at entry and education have important interactive effects on the inverse relationship between entry earnings and earnings growth. At younger ages and at higher education levels, the inverse relationship between immigrant entry earnings and earnings growth is intensified.
32. The restrictive nature of the pre-1965 admission policy meant that post-1965 migrants from countries whose immigration had been severely restricted generally lacked immediate U.S. family members. They were therefore most likely to immigrate under the employment preference provisions and thus the initial immigrants were more likely to have transferable skills to the U.S. labor market. As they established a U.S. base, relatives with less transferable skills could enter under the family admission categories. For instance, the entry earnings of working-age Korean men were 75 percent of the earnings of working-age U.S. -born men for the cohort of immigrants who entered the United States in the 1965–1970 period and 44 percent of the U.S. native 1985–1990 cohort.

In the United States, immigrants are more likely to be working-age than their U.S.-born counterparts. This means they are more likely to be active in the labor force, allowing them to contribute to the economy not only as consumers but also as taxpayers, helping fund social services and programs like Medicare and Social Security.

Immigrant households contribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal income, state, and local taxes nationwide and hold a tremendous amount of spending power. This gives them significant economic clout, helping support local communities as consumers and taxpayers. Like all residents in the United States regardless of where they were born, immigrants make use of public services like education, healthcare, and public safety. Even with these costs, however, immigrants’ economic contributions far outweigh the extra cost of additional public services they incur.

Workforce
The growth in the immigrant population has helped to strengthen America’s labor force. As baby boomers retire, younger immigrants are filling crucial gaps in the market. Nationally, immigrants are more likely to hold an advanced degree than the U.S.-born. They are also more likely to have less than a high school education. Uniquely, this allows them to fill critical shortages at both ends of the skill spectrum, from high-tech fields to agriculture, hospitality, and service industries.

Jobs in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math—or “STEM”—fields are some of the most productive jobs in the U.S. economy. These jobs are also expected to experience some of the highest growth rates in the next decade, second only to healthcare jobs. While immigrants already play a huge part in maintaining the United States’ role as a leading innovator, they will also be instrumental in helping high-tech industries meet their full potential as their needs for high-skilled STEM workers increase rapidly in the future.

As millions of baby boomers become elderly, the U.S. healthcare system is facing unprecedented demand, adding jobs faster than any other segment of the economy. Many healthcare businesses and providers are struggling with finding enough workers, and in some rural areas, shortages are particularly acute. Immigrants have already been filling some of our most glaring healthcare needs.

Mobility, migration and foreigners
U.S. immigrant men’s earning trajectories vary by country of origin
February 1, 2021 Leafia Ye and Michal Engelman
Americas, immi, Migration, mobility, Work
Immigrant men who arrived in the United States in the latter part of the twentieth century experienced varied earning trajectories. Leafia Ye and Michal Engelman show that those who came from several countries in Asia and Africa experienced substantial earnings growth and tended to stay in the United States for the long term, while Central America and Caribbean immigrants frequently experienced temporary and permanent exits from the formal labor force.
Debates about the integration of immigrants into the U.S. economy often consider immigrants who arrived in the late twentieth century as a single group defined primarily by their foreign-born status. In a recent study (Ye and Engelman 2020), we show instead that immigrant men’s earning trajectories vary considerably by country of origin. Furthermore, we show that temporary and permanent exits from the formal labor force are just as important as upward and downward mobilities in shaping these trajectories.
Immigrants’ economic integration
Most immigrants move to the United States in pursuit of a better future, an idea which often encompasses upward economic mobility. Whether they succeed is both a function of immigrants’ own characteristics (including their level of education and marketable skills) and characteristics of the U.S. economy that promote or hinder the integration of foreign-born workers. Decades of research has come to the overall conclusion that, on average, immigrants begin their careers in the U.S. with lower earnings relative to the native-born but gradually close this gap over a few decades (e.g., Duleep & Dowhan, 2002). Many prior studies of earnings grouped together immigrants across origins and focused primarily on long-term immigrants with a consistent record of working in the United States. However, the U.S. immigrant population has grown increasingly diverse since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, with different migrant populations varying widely in their levels of human capital and the circumstances preceding their migration decisions. Furthermore, several foreign-born groups have non-linear migration and work histories, with individuals migrating to the United States and later returning to their home country, or experiencing multiple cycles of short-term labor migration (Tannenbaum 2007).

A more detailed look at immigrants’ earning trajectories
We tracked the earnings records of young immigrant men who entered the U.S. labor market in 1978 over a period of 35 years using a unique data set from the Social Security Administration. Because immigrants entered the labor force at varying time points during 1978, we start our actual tracking process in 1979 – their first complete year in the labor force. Every year, an individual may be in one of six potential employment and earnings categories (Figure 1). Some immigrants are classified in one of the three tertiles of the U.S. earnings distribution, others are temporarily out of the labor force (which we know because we later observe them in the labor force again); and others leave the formal labor force permanently, though we know they remained in the United States. Finally, some immigrants disappear from official records after working in the United States for years. We suspect that these individuals emigrated from the United States, although we do not know for sure. For comparison, we apply the same classification to a cohort of U.S.-born men of the same age, among whom emigration is extremely rare (Figure 1, right panel).
What stands out is that immigrants’ earning trajectories are marked more by exits from the labor force and stagnation in earnings growth than by upward mobility (Figure 1, left panel). While the share of immigrants in the lower earnings tertile dropped from about 60% when they first entered the labor force to below 20% after 35 years – a seemingly positive development – the share of men in the middle or top tertiles of the earnings distribution barely increased during this period. This is in large part because many immigrants leave the labor force every year. Notably, immigrants who are less satisfied with their economic prospects in the U.S. are more likely to leave (VanHook and Zhang 2011), so studies examining the earnings of long-term migrants disproportionately represent those who experienced higher earnings.
The role of country of origin
We found tremendous differences in immigrants’ earning trajectories by country of origin. These differences are likely shaped both by the economic and social contexts in immigrants’ place of origin and by U.S. policies that influence both migration streams and the economic opportunities available to immigrants.
Immigrants from Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan entered the labor force concentrated at the upper end of the economic distribution and followed similar trajectories over time (Figure 2). Many of these immigrant men from high-income countries left the United States after a high-earning career, a pattern matching the profile of H1 visa holders who are predominantly high-skilled workers. It is worth noting that while applicants for an H1 visa were previously required to exhibit an intent to eventually return home (Koslowski 2014), this is no longer the case today. The Immigration Act of 1990 split the H1 visa into H1-A (for nurses) and H1-B visas, and established H1-B as a “dual intent” visa that allows individuals to apply for permanent residency.
In contrast, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Haiti entered the U.S. labor market at lower earnings levels and experienced earnings stagnation over the years (Figure 3). About 70% of men in this group were at the bottom of the earnings distribution when they first arrived – a proportion that declined over time as a growing number of men left the labor force permanently. The share of individuals in the middle and top tertiles barely expanded over time. Another notable characteristic of this group is their high rates of temporary labor force exit: many individuals entered the U.S. labor force, worked for a few years, and then left the United States before returning again. Overall, the trajectories of these immigrants seem to better match the case of H2 visa holders – usually temporary laborers filling positions that require fewer formal credentials.
Immigrants from Iran and Nigeria appeared somewhat similar to those in Group 2 when they first arrived, but experienced upward mobility over time. The share of individuals in the middle and top tertiles increased from 5-7% to about 40% over the years, representing the most optimistic picture of earnings growth among all immigrant groups. The relative success of this group may be explained by the fact that many immigrants who started working in 1978 were highly selected from the origin population. In the 1970s, Iran and Nigeria both went through socioeconomic instability due to political upheaval, which led to the emigration of students, professionals, and middle- and upper-class families in general. While many arrived with no immediate employment prospects, they likely had some resources that supported them in achieving or regaining a well-paying job after a few years.
Immigrants from other origins had still different trajectories. For example, immigrant men from India, the Philippines, and many other origins experienced moderate earning mobility and tended to stay in the U.S. for the long term.
Overall, historical contingencies and socioeconomic contexts in sending countries and in the U.S. are clearly predictive of immigrants’ earning trajectories. At the same time, every immigrant group is heterogeneous along multiple dimensions, a fact that immigrant policy debates would do well to assimilate.

In the United States, immigration based on family ties has long been the main criterion for admitting new immigrants. Under the provisions of current immigration law, the family-based immigration category allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or “green card” holders, to bring certain family members to the United States. Much has been debated about family-based immigration and the critical role families play in the adaptation, integration, and wellbeing of newcomers. But some confusion exists regarding the economic aspects of family-based immigration. To help unpack those aspects, this report focuses on one of them—namely, the earnings of family-based immigrants.
A defining feature of immigrants coming to the United States via the family-based system is their upward economic mobility. Since 1965, when family-based immigration became the dominant means of migrating to the United States, the earnings of immigrants in general have increased dramatically during their first decade in the country. This trend is completely missed when economists focus only on the initial earnings of immigrants upon their entry into the U.S. labor market.
In this report, we use data from the decennial census—matched with data on admissions criteria from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—to examine the earnings gains over time of all immigrants, as well as the earnings gains experienced by family-based immigrants compared to employment-based immigrants.
Our analysis indicates that immigrants overall experience large earnings increases as their time in the United States increases. Additionally, working-age immigrant men who come to the United States via family-based channels tend to experience a much greater rate of earnings growth over time than those who come through employment-based channels. This occurs despite employment-based immigrant men having higher initial earnings than those who are family-based. This initial advantage in earnings is not surprising given that employment-based immigrants are admitted explicitly for the purpose of filling the immediate labor demands of employers. But the lower average earnings of family-based immigrant men when they first enter the U.S. labor market subsequently increase at a much higher rate than the earnings of employment-based immigrant men. This suggests that the earnings path of family-based immigrants throughout their lives is a much better indicator of their economic potential than their initial earnings upon arriving in the country.
We argue that the upward trajectory in earnings among family-based immigrants is the product of the high rate of investment that they make in their own human capital (education and training) in order to acquire new skills that will improve their employment prospects. From this perspective, low initial earnings by family-based immigrants cannot be dismissed as an inefficient use of their skills and abilities. Instead, it becomes apparent that family-based immigrants contribute to the long-term economic productivity of the United States.
The economic role of family-based immigrants extends beyond the earnings growth that is driven by the investments they make in their own skills and education (human capital). Census and INS data also indicate that skilled immigrants who enter the country through the employment-based system are often followed by highly educated siblings who enter via the family-based system. Likewise, there is a significant relationship between the share of immigrants admitted through the sibling category of the family-based system and the propensity to be self-employed. This suggests that siblings play an important role in family business formation.
Unfortunately, the economic importance of family-based immigrants is not widely recognized among U.S. lawmakers. Much immigration-reform legislation introduced in Congress—such as the 2013 Senate immigration reform bill and the 2017 Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act—would sacrifice some family-based immigrants for the sake of more “merit-based” immigrants, who would be admitted on the basis of certain human-capital attributes. The legislation does not reflect that both family- and employment-based immigration, the core components of the current U.S. immigration system, are economically powerful. In fact, they complement each other. Employment-based immigrants fill immediate labor needs and family-based immigrants provide a flexible workforce that will readily adapt to future changes in labor demand.
