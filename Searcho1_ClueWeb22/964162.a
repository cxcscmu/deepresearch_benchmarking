When should Agile teams make time for innovation? Hmm, that's an interesting question. I'm familiar with Agile methodologies, but I'm not entirely sure about the best practices for incorporating innovation into the workflow. Maybe I should look up some information on this.

First, I need to understand what Agile is all about. Agile is a project management approach that focuses on iterative development, where projects are broken down into smaller tasks and completed in short sprints. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. So, in an Agile setting, teams are already somewhat geared towards adaptability and continuous improvement, which are key aspects of innovation.

But, innovation often requires dedicated time and resources. In a traditional Agile setup, the focus is mostly on delivering incremental improvements to products or services based on customer needs and feedback. However, sometimes breakthrough innovations require stepping back from the day-to-day tasks and exploring new ideas or technologies.

I recall hearing about Google's "20% time" policy, where employees were allowed to spend 20% of their work time on side projects that interested them. This led to the creation of several successful products like Gmail and AdSense. Maybe something similar could be applied in Agile teams to encourage innovation.

Perhaps Agile teams should allocate a specific portion of their sprint time for innovation activities. But how much time is appropriate? 10%? 20%? It might vary depending on the team's capacity and the project's requirements.

Alternatively, maybe innovation should be incorporated into the regular sprint planning process. Teams could reserve a few story points or hours each sprint for innovation tasks. This way, it becomes a regular part of the workflow rather than an afterthought.

Another approach could be to have dedicated innovation sprints or hackathons where the entire team focuses solely on exploring new ideas without the pressure of delivering immediate business value. This could foster a culture of creativity and experimentation within the team.

However, I need to consider the potential drawbacks of allocating time for innovation. There's a risk that this time might not be used effectively, leading to wasted resources. Also, in environments where there's high pressure to deliver features and meet deadlines, dedicating time to innovation might not be feasible.

Maybe it's essential to strike a balance between delivering immediate business value and investing in long-term innovation. Perhaps Agile teams should assess their current workload and prioritize innovation accordingly.

I think it would be helpful to look at some case studies or best practices from companies that have successfully integrated innovation into their Agile processes. Maybe there are frameworks or guidelines available that can help determine the right time and manner to allocate resources for innovation.

Let me try searching for some information on this.

Agile teams should make time for innovation continuously throughout the program increment.
The teams on Agile Release Train, therefore, should conduct the innovation activities throughout the Program Increment (during the 8 to 12 weeks) to ensure that there is innovation and creativity when carrying out the PI.
Every Program Increment (PI), the Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration happens and serves many goals. It provides dedicated time for innovation, ongoing education, PI Planning, and Inspect and Adapt (I&A) events, as well as acting as an estimate buffer for reaching PI Objectives.
Every Iteration is crucial, and the teams are largely focused on generating immediate results. The Solution advances closer to market with each iteration. The focus on delivering solutions is fierce and unwavering.

Innovation and Planning Iteration - Scaled Agile Framework
Inertia is the residue of past innovation efforts. Left unmanaged, it consumes the resources required to fund next-generation innovation.
—Geoffrey Moore
100% utilization drives unpredictability.
—Don Reinertsen
Innovation and Planning Iteration
The Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration occurs every Program Increment (PI) and serves multiple purposes. It acts as an estimating buffer for meeting PI Objectives and provides dedicated time for innovation, continuing education, PI Planning, and Inspect and Adapt (I&A) events.
SAFe has an intense focus on continuous customer value delivery, and people are busy working on the Features they committed to during PI planning. Every Iteration counts and the teams are mostly heads down, delivering near-term value. One iteration after another, the Solution marches closer to market. The attention to solution delivery is intense and unrelenting.
Of course, a focus on one thing—delivery—can lead to a lack of focus on another—innovation. Given the constant urgency for delivery, there’s a risk that the tyranny of the urgent [1] will override any opportunity to innovate. To address this, SAFe provides dedicated innovation and planning iterations which are a key aspect of the Lean Enterprise’s broader innovation culture.
Details
Understand the IP Iteration Activities
Innovation and planning iterations provide a regular, cadence-based opportunity, every Program Increment (PI), for teams to work on activities that are difficult to fit into a continuous, incremental value delivery pattern. These may include:
Time for innovation and exploration, beyond the iterations dedicated to delivery
Work on technical infrastructure, tooling, and other impediments to delivery
Education to support continuous learning and improvement
Cross training to develop skills in new domains, development languages, and systems
Dedicated time for the Inspect & Adapt (I&A) event, backlog refinement, including final prioritization of Features using Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF), and PI planning
IP iterations fulfill another critical role by providing an estimating buffer for meeting PI objectives and enhancing the predictability of PI performance.
Agile Release Trains (ARTs) typically report that their overall efficiency, velocity, and job satisfaction are enhanced by regular opportunities to ‘recharge their batteries and sharpen their tools.’
Allow Time for Innovation
One of the pillars of the SAFe Lean-Agile Mindset is innovation, but finding time for ideation and change in the midst of delivery deadlines can be difficult. To this end, many enterprises use IP iterations for research and design activities such as hackathons. There are two simple rules for hackathons:
People can work on whatever they want, with whomever they want, so long as the work reflects the mission of the company
The teams demo their work to others at the end of the hackathon
The learnings from hackathons routinely make their way into Program Backlogs and often help drive innovation. They’re fun, too!
Dedicate Time to PI Events
Performing the I&A and PI planning during the IP iteration avoids a reduction in velocity of the regular iterations. More importantly, since these events are held on a regular cadence and can be scheduled well in advance, their occurrence is better guaranteed.
Also, it’s likely that some just-in-time, last-responsible-moment program and solution backlog refinement and feature and capability elaboration during this period can significantly increase the productivity of the upcoming planning session.
Integrate the Complete Solution
The PI System Demo occurs at the end of each PI. It is the integrated presentation of the work of all teams on the train, done in a staging environment which emulates production as closely as possible. For ARTs that are part of a Solution Train, the PI system demo feeds into the aggregate Solution Demo, which also takes place for during the IP Iteration. It’s a more structured and formal affair, as it demonstrates the accumulation of all the features and capabilities developed over the course of the entire PI for a Solution Train.
When a solution includes hardware (and other components), it’s harder to integrate end-to-end continuously and full integration may be feasible only during the IP iteration. In these cases, it’s just common sense to plan for that.
However, the IP iteration should not be the only attempt to integrate the assets into the system. Full or partial integration happens over the course of the PI, with a total solution integration occurring at least once per PI. This approach validates the assumptions early enough to be able to respond to significant problems and risks within the PI.
Advance Development Infrastructure
Lean delivery puts increased pressure on the development infrastructure: new continuous integration environments require provisioning, new test automation frameworks must be implemented and maintained, Agile project management tooling adopted, upgrading or enhancing cross-team and train communications systems, and the list goes on. Many times, the improvement stories are from the team’s Iteration Retrospective or Enablers.
We all understand that we have to sharpen our tools from time to time; Agile teams are no different. Indeed, they have an even higher dependency on their working environments, so time must be spent continuously improving them. It’s often more efficient to improve infrastructure or perform a migration at a time when the teams aren’t in the midst of critical work.
Enable Continuous Learning
Employees at every level are lifelong learners. Changes in technology, as well as changes to method and practice, are routine; opportunities for continuing education, however, are far less frequent. Also, the initial move to Lean-Agile requires many new techniques and skills, including:
Feature and Story writing
Building in quality
Automated testing
Collective ownership
Agile Architecture
Continuous Integration
Pair work
Mastering Product Owner and Scrum Master roles
Team building
Practitioners are also challenged to keep their technical skills current. New technologies are being introduced more frequently than ever before. Investing in people who can work across multiple systems, domains, and languages creates a ‘T-shaped’ (deep skill in one area, working knowledge in multiple other areas) and even ‘E-shaped’ (deep skill in more than one area) workforce. This provides the organization with maximum agility and flexibility to deliver the most important backlog items. However, it is difficult to find time for this type of growth alongside the drive to constantly deliver new features. IP iterations are a perfect time for this investment.
Making time for continuing education gives teams and leaders a welcome opportunity to learn and master these new techniques. It can also be used to launch and support Communities of Practice devoted to these and other topics. The net results benefit both the individual and the enterprise: employee mastery and job satisfaction increase, velocity goes up, and time-to-market goes down.
Leverage the Built-In Estimation Buffer
Lean flow teaches us that operating at “100 percent utilization drives unpredictable results [2].” Simply put, planning everyone to full capacity, does not allow people the ability to flex when problems inevitably occur. The result is unpredictability and delays in value delivery. As a countermeasure, the IP iteration offers a ‘guard band’ (or buffer) to prevent unfinished work from the current PI from carrying over to the next PI.
During PI planning, the ART does not plan features or stories for the IP iteration, providing a buffer (extra time) to the teams for responding to unforeseen events, delays resulting from dependencies, and other issues, increasing their ability to meet Team and Program PI Objectives. This buffer substantially increases the predictability of the program’s outcomes, which is extremely important to the business. However, routinely using that time for completing work is a failure pattern. Doing so defeats the primary purpose of the IP iteration, and innovation will likely suffer. Teams must take care that this estimating guard band does not merely become a crutch.
A Sample IP Iteration Calendar
IP iterations take on a somewhat standard schedule and format. Figure 1 provides an example IP iteration calendar. The items in orange represent Solution Train events, while the blue ones are for a single ART.

Timeboxing In Agile | Benefits of Timebox in Agile
Timebox In Agile
by StarAgile
March 27, 2020
Category Agile and Scrum
Timebox for daily scrum is essential to track the work done to produce results and keep it cost-effective. Also, when you assign any task to a naïve person, you need to tell them about what is expected from them. Apart from telling that you need to also tell how much time they can consume to complete the task.
Let us take a typical scenario, you ask your child aged 10 to peel orange and he/she does it. Now, ask your child to do the same job and tell that it has to be completed within a stipulated time. Do you notice the difference in the activity? Yes, at both times he/she peels orange. But, when you have allotted the time, you might have noticed a sense of responsibility in them and a quick action as they had a timeline.
The same is applicable to project development as well. It is always good to fix time and assign tasks rather than allowing to finish the work and monitoring the time. The former method has a lot of differences when compared to the latter. We shall now understand why timeboxing is required, what are its benefits and how to achieve the same from an agile project development perspective.
What is it?
Several events take place in an agile project and allocating time for each event is called timebox in Agile. How do you know what time to allocate? Who allocates time? To answer the first question, it is already in practice for many years now and each event has a defined timebox in agile. Therefore, allocation becomes easy and further the scrum master and the product owner discuss to decide on the duration based on the product backlog, the team capacity, bandwidth, and their experience.
Examples
Every task we do right from fitness activities, household chores, kid's education, everything is an example of timeboxing. When you start going to school you will know that each class will be for a defined duration of time, we call this a period. This is when first we started working with a fixed time. Yes, but we might not have called this timeboxing.
However, when it comes to timebox in agile we are bound to work on each event within a timeframe and that is when we realize this very term.
The table below shows the time allotted for each event in agile projects assuming that the sprint is a 1-week sprint.
Events
Time hrs/week
Percentage

6
Standup meeting
1hr 15 mins

Development work

Sprint Review

Sprint Retrospective

From the above table, you can understand that every week we work for 40 hours and in that, time spent on meetings will consume 5 hours. Daily stand up meeting is a meeting conducted daily which is done for 15 mins in a day. Now, the team will get an idea that they have only 35 hours in hand to complete their task individually. Therefore it is important to emphasize on time box for daily scrum.
It is now easy to manipulate the time for each event based on the sprint length. Yes, sprint is the backbone of agile projects and based on the sprint duration the team can plan all their events to complete the task assigned during every iteration.
Sprint duration, in general, every agile practitioner follows will vary from 2 to 4 weeks. Ideally speaking, 2 weeks sprint is universally followed and hence timeboxing becomes easy for even a new agile team.
Benefits of timebox in Agile and Scrum
After understanding what is it, you will know how it is beneficial. But, instead of knowing the general benefits, we would want to throw some light on how it is specifically useful in the agile domain.

We are aware that agile is an iterative process and hence it is highly dynamic. Therefore, keeping timeframe for each event will motivate the team and hence enhances productivity. The entire team works with focus thus accomplishing the business goal and making the customer feel satisfied.
2. Prevents Feature creep
Software projects face this problem often. It is an addition of features incrementally without being sure about the need. This will have a strong impact on the time, quality and cost of the project. Timeboxing will allow the team to work with their maximum potential to reach the goal. They will go with the time and hence will not add any features assuming it to add value.
3. Seeds sense of responsibility
The responsible behavior of not just the team but the SM and PO is also important. Timeboxing reminds the PO to prioritize product backlogs. It also makes the SM follow timelines during meetings. Scrum framework emphasizes daily stand up and thus sticking to that 15 minutes is important. Hence timebox will keep every stakeholder on toes to work towards the result.
However, one can think that timeboxing might lead to chasing time and diluting the quality. You must understand that these timelines are decided after so many trials and past experiences. Therefore, you must accept that these are real and doable deadlines.
Tips to effectively implement timeboxing for Agile planning
At the first cut, it feels intimidating to see a huge list of tasks to be accomplished in the given time frame. But, there is no need to panic as we reiterate the fact that these timelines are realistic. All you need to do to handle is to follow the simple ways suggested below to use timeboxing and it will become a practice eventually.
You must first allocate time to yourself for completing your task. This you can do based on your competency and experience. For instance, in a 2-week sprint, you will have 70 hours to complete your task. There is no micromanagement in this and you are free to take your time and divide the tasks. Start allocating time by breaking your work into modules based on your knowledge.
Start the timer and do not look at it until you finish the task. After completing check the timer to know if you have taken a longer time than allocated or vice versa. Based on this experience you can now get going with the remaining task. Remember, you may fail to stick on to time initially but slowly it will become a habit.
Soon after you check on the timing of your first task whether you complete or not on time, don’t think about it for your next task. Just take a break and start your next task with a fresh mind.
Break the task into smaller chunks based on your competency to prevent getting demotivated. Always remember that your completion is important and no one will monitor you on your task.
Finally, keep timeboxing in mind and work towards achieving the same by self reviewing your progress.
Whether you are a developer, quality engineer, product in charge, irrespective of the role you play in agile projects, you must register for a CSM Certification Online to master the art of timeboxing.

Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration: Everything you need to know - Agilephoria
Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration represents a unique opportunity for teams to work on innovation and improvements. It gives them time to reset their brains, recharge their batteries and sharpen their tools, creatively think of some other problems, learn, and grow. This will improve their overall efficiency, velocity, and job satisfaction, and help the team not to burn out and be the heroes an organization needs to thrive.
In SAFe® (Scaled Agile Framework or Enterprises®), there is an intense focus on continuous customer value delivery, and people are busy working on Features they committed to during PI Planning. Because of this intense and unrelenting attention to solution delivery, there isn’t much time for innovation. But, the fact is, that without innovation, you die – as the organization on the market, against your competitors. To solve this issue, SAFe provides dedicated Innovation and Planning (IP) Iterations.
What is an IP Iteration?
Iteration and Planning (IP) iteration is a regular cadence-based opportunity that occurs at the end of every Program Increment (PI). It has a standard schedule and format, and it serves multiple purposes:
– It provides dedicated time for innovation, exploration, backlog refinement and PI events, such as PI Planning, and Inspect and Adapt (I&A);
– It provides an estimating buffer for meeting PI objectives and enhancing the predictability of PI performance;
– It prevents that the ‘tyranny of the urgent’ – intense focus on continuous customer value delivery – will override any opportunity to innovate;
– It provides time to work on technical infrastructure, tooling and other impediments to delivery;
– It makes a great opportunity for cross training to develop skills in new domains, development languages and systems.
Above you can see an example of calendar for an IP Iteration, as recommended by SAFe. Items in green represent Solution Train events, while blue ones are for a single ART.
Innovation and Planning (IP) Activities
Time for innovation and exploration
Although innovation represents one of the four pillars of Lean-Agile Mindset and the SAFe House of Lean, finding time to innovate can be very challenging. This is where IP iterations help. Many enterprises use them for research and design activities such as hackathons. They are fun and fruitful for an organization, as well as beneficial for individual employees. In SAFe Hackathons are not only reserved for developers, as every idea is valuable and each person participating is appreciated. In fact, all the people on the program are welcome – developers, testers, agile coaches, Product Owners, Product Managers, architects … During hackathons people can work on whatever they want, with whomever they want, so long as the work reflects the mission of the company. At the end of the event, they demo their work to others and the learnings routinely make their way into Program Backlogs. In this way hackathons represent a fun activity that helps drive innovation.
Time to work on technical infrastructure, tooling, and other impediments to delivery
Agile teams highly depend on their working environments, so time must be spent improving them. IP iteration represents a perfect time to improve infrastructure or perform a migration, as teams aren’t in the middle of critical work. It is also a great opportunity to work on improvement stories from team’s Iteration Retrospective or Enablers, such as implementing new automation frameworks, adopting Agile project management tooling, upgrading, or enhancing cross-team and train communications systems.
Dedicated time to PI events
Because PI events such as Inspect & Adapt, PI Planning and final prioritization of Features using Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) are performed during the IP iteration, they don’t decrease the velocity of regular influence. Thanks to the cadence-based IP Iteration, these events are also better guaranteed, held on a regular cadence, and scheduled well in advance.
Time for education
Although technologies, methods and practices change all the time, there usually aren’t many opportunities for continuing education. IP iterations are a perfect time for this investment. They enable a culture of continuous learning and give teams and leaders an opportunity to learn and master new skills and techniques, such as:
– feature and story writing
– building in quality automated testing
– collective ownership
– agile architecture
– continuous integration
– pair work
– mastering product owner and scrum master roles
– team building
IP iterations not only enable employee mastery, but also increase job satisfaction, velocity and reduce time-to-market and represent a great opportunity to launch and support Communities of Practice. Additionally, investing in people will create a ‘T-shaped’ (deep skill in one area, working knowledge in multiple other areas) and even ‘E-shaped’ (deep skill in more than one area) workforce and provide maximum agility and flexibility to deliver the most important backlog items.
Time for the final integration of the solution
The PI System Demo occurs at the end of each PI. For ARTs that are part of a bigger Solution Train, the PI System Demo feeds into the aggregate Solution Demo, which takes place during the IP Iteration. Solution Demo is more structured and formal affair, and it demonstrates the accumulation of all the features and capabilities developed over the course of the entire Program Increment for a Solution Train. Because of its complexity – especially when a solution includes hardware and other components that are harder to integrate end-to-end continuously, full integration can only be feasible during the IP Iteration. However, it should not be the only attempt to integrate the assets into the system – it should happen regularly over the course of the PI, with a total solution integration occurring at least once per PI (@Scaled Agile, Inc. ).
Time for final readiness activities
IP Iteration provides time for final user acceptance testing and documentation and other readiness activities that are not feasible or economical to perform every iteration.
Leverage the built-in estimation buffer
Planning to full capacity leads to delays in value delivery and unpredictability. As the ART doesn’t plan features or stories for the IP Iteration during PI Planning, IP Iteration offers buffer to prevent carrying unfinished work from current PI to the next one. This substantially increases the predictability of the program’s outcomes and increases team’s ability to meet Team and Program PI Objectives by giving them buffer for responding to unforeseen events, delays resulting from dependencies and other issues. At this point it should be emphasized that the buffer should not be abused. Routinely using that time for completing work will lead to failure and innovation will likely suffer.
Reasons not to skip the IP Iteration
IP Iterations represent a very important element of SAFe. Without them, there would be no time for education, cross-training and exploring new technologies, frameworks, automations, and processes. There would also be no time to work on reducing technical debt and no slack time that helps increase the morale and motivation and is fundamental for people to reset their brains and start thinking creatively.
Without IP Iteration there would be no buffer that prevents carrying unfinished work into following PI, RTEs wouldn’t have time to prepare for PI Planning and there would be no opportunity for the whole ART to run a retrospective and problem solving workshops and solve issues that cannot be fixed on team level.
All the above are reasons that make IP Iteration necessary if you want to work successfully with SAFe and leverage all its benefits. It is an opportunity for people to brainstorm new ideas, focus on new solutions, prepare for following Program Increment and reflect on previous one.

Alright, so I've got some information here about when Agile teams should make time for innovation. From what I've read, it seems that innovation is a crucial part of Agile methodologies, but it can be challenging to find time for it amidst the regular delivery focus.

First, I came across a course hero question that asks when Agile teams should make time for innovation, and the options were:

- When there are enabler stories in the backlog

- Continuously throughout the program increment

- Only during innovation and planning iteration

- At a consistent time each day during the iteration

The answer provided was that Agile teams should make time for innovation continuously throughout the program increment. That makes sense because Agile is all about flexibility and continuous improvement.

Another source mentioned the concept of Innovation and Planning (IP) iterations in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). These IP iterations occur at the end of each Program Increment (PI) and serve multiple purposes, including dedicated time for innovation, continuing education, PI planning, and inspect and adapt events.

It seems that IP iterations provide a structured time for innovation, which is important for preventing the "tyranny of the urgent," where the immediate demands of delivery overshadow the need for innovation. By having a specific iteration dedicated to innovation, teams can set aside time to explore new ideas without feeling guilty about not focusing on immediate deliverables.

Moreover, IP iterations act as an estimating buffer for meeting PI objectives. By not planning features or stories for this iteration, teams have extra time to address unforeseen issues or delays that might arise during the PI.

Additionally, IP iterations are used for education and continuous learning, which is essential for keeping team skills up-to-date and fostering a culture of innovation.

However, one potential downside is that if teams routinely use the IP iteration to complete unfinished work from previous iterations, it defeats the purpose of having a buffer and dedicated innovation time. So, it's important to strike a balance and ensure that innovation activities are prioritized during these iterations.

Another approach mentioned was the idea of allocating a specific portion of each iteration for innovation, perhaps inspired by Google's "20% time." This could be a consistent time each day or a certain percentage of overall team capacity dedicated to exploring new ideas.

This seems like a good complementary approach to IP iterations. By having both regular, small allocations of time for innovation throughout the iterations and dedicated IP iterations, teams can maintain a持续的创新文化。

此外，文章中还提到了敏捷团队应该具备的一些特质，比如自我组织、跨职能、专注于价值交付等。这些特质有助于团队在创新活动中取得成功。

总之，我认为敏捷团队应该在多个层面为创新留出时间：

1. **在整个项目增量中持续进行**：鼓励团队成员在日常工作中不断寻求改进和创新的机会。

2. **专门的创新和规划迭代**：在每个项目增量结束时设置一个迭代，专门用于创新、教育和规划下一期的工作。

3. **定期分配时间**：例如，每天预留一定时间或每个迭代中分配特定的小时数用于创新活动。

通过这种综合方法，敏捷团队可以确保他们在追求短期交付目标的同时，也不忽视长期的创新和发展。

**最终答案**

\[ \boxed{\text{Agile teams should make time for innovation both continuously throughout the program increment and during dedicated innovation and planning iterations.}} \]
