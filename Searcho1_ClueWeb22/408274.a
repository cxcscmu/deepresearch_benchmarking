Alright, so I've got this question about whether we should tax the rich more, and I need to look at both the pros and cons of that idea. I'm not entirely sure where to start, so maybe I should begin by understanding what it means to tax the rich more. I think it generally refers to increasing the tax rates for high-income individuals or implementing higher taxes on wealth. But to get a better grasp, perhaps I should look up some information on progressive taxation and how it affects different economies.

Let me consider doing a search to understand progressive taxation better. Maybe something like "pros and cons of taxing the rich more" or "progressive taxation effects." Hmm, maybe I'll go with "arguments for and against higher taxes on the wealthy." That seems broad enough to cover both pros and cons.

Controversy will always follow humans where ever we go. Humans have argued over many issues for centuries, often times with no conclusion or “correct” answer ever in sight. One common issue that has been debated since the early 1900s is whether or not the more wealthy individuals in a society should be taxed more heavily than their poorer counterparts. Many have argued over the pros and cons of the taxation of richer people, but when one looks at it objectively, the pros far outweigh the cons. Not only do the pros outweigh the cons, but a question one must ask oneself is whether or not prosperous people really need that extra money?  Richer people should be taxed higher because it is better for the economy, social classes will …show more content…
The encouragement of economic disparity because of these tax cuts is bad for America. The US should be aiming for more social and economic equality for everybody. Tax cuts can slow down the economy by putting more money into the wealthy peoples’ hands and giving less to the people who need it. Another reason that the wealthy should pay more taxes is because they owe it to society to do so. Every person wouldn’t be where they are today without the people who helped raise them and the society they were raised in. In “The Great Gatsby”, Nick Carraway is disgusted with Tom and Daisy, “Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made” (Fitzgerald 179). Nick is repelled by how Tom and Daisy, with all of their money, would do nothing to help the society or other people. Successful people are largely successful due to the society and conditions that they were raised in. Without the better conditions that they were luckily born into, it is logical to question just how successful someone in the top one or ten percent could have been. In a recent commencement speech last summer at Princeton, author Michael Lewis stated “Recognize that if you have had success, you also have had luck—and with luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your Gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky”. In a

In systems governing interactions among entities, the term ‘fair’ may be a reasonable description of what is ethical.

Tax the Rich? Pros and Cons

Should We Increase Taxes for the Wealthy?
Should we tax the rich more? In the US and across the world, there is an ongoing discussion about how much tax the wealthy should pay. People debate whether or not taxes should be increased for the richest 1%.
As economic problems have intensified in recent years, so has the debate. The people on the left of politics generally want higher taxes for the wealthy, insisting that those richest 1% can easily afford to make a larger contribution. Whereas people on the political right generally argue that increasing taxes for higher-earners is counterproductive and may actually worsen inequality rather than solve it.
Below, I have laid out the main pros and cons of the argument: Should we tax the rich more? Read on.
7 Reasons Why We SHOULD Tax the Rich More
When economic times are tough, the government needs to look for ways to bring in more money. Increasing taxes on the wealthy makes sense, as they are the ones who are most able to afford tax increases. The people who have benefitted the most from the economy should support programs that help the poorest.
A progressive tax system can prevent wealth discrepancies from getting too large. When the gap between rich and poor gets beyond a certain point, there is an increased risk of social instability and strife, such as crime and political turmoil. Extreme differences in wealth are also seen by many economists as one of the factors that led to the Wall Street Crash in 1929.
Taxing the rich can also be justified on moral grounds, if it is used as a form of wealth redistribution, with the tax money raised being used to aid the poorest sections of the population.
Because income from wealth is taxed less than income from work, wealthy taxpayers use many generous tax benefits (like delayed or defrayed taxes on inheritance or capital gains) to drastically lower their taxes. Expanding the types of incomes considered "taxable" would help offset this imbalance, and adjusting these preferences would make the tax code more progressive.
There is evidence to show that economic growth can occur despite a raise in taxes. Countries such as Australia, Sweden, and Canada all do well in terms of economic growth despite requiring high taxes.
Since the 1970s, the incomes of the wealthiest members of society has increased dramatically, while the income levels for the rest of society have barely changed in real terms. Since the 1980s, those at the very top have seen the fastest growth in income. This means that adjustments need to be made.
Money is needed to pay for defense, health, education, social security, etc., and it has to come from somewhere.

6 Reasons Why the Rich SHOULD NOT Pay More Tax
Governments already waste much of the money that they collect. If taxes are increased, all that will happen is that the government will just have more money to waste and there will still be no incentive for them to spend efficiently.
The raising of taxes acts as a disincentive for individuals and businesses to make money. Some of the most talented people and businesses will leave the country and find somewhere with lower taxes if they feel that their efforts are not being sufficiently rewarded.
People argue that raised taxes have slowed the economy and led to market stagnation.
There are numerous examples of how cutting taxes for businesses actually increases overall revenue. Increasing taxes, on the other hand, just makes businesses alter their investment, spending, and tax behaviors in order to find ways of cutting their tax expenditure, which generally leads to an overall decrease in revenue for the government.
Higher taxes inevitably lead to a reduction in investment, as the people most likely to invest have their money supply hit. If there is less investment, then there are fewer businesses, and unemployment increases. With more people out of work, there is less money being spent, and the economy goes into a downward spiral.
Increasing taxes for the wealthiest segment of society is socially divisive and encourages a class war situation where the poor and middle class begin to resent the rich, and the rich, who find themselves paying an increasing share of the tax bill, resent the poor and the middle class in return.

A Brief History of Taxes in the US
1760s: The American Revolution is kickstarted by a rebellion against the British taxation policy.
1770s: The newly independent US collects taxes on imports ("tariffs"), whiskey, and (for a time) glass windows.
1800s: States and localities introduce a poll tax (which applies to voters) and a tax on property.
1900s: State and federal inheritance taxes start after 1900.
1930s: States impose sales taxes in the 1930s.
1913: Income taxes are imposed temporarily during the Civil War, but it is not until 1913 that they are brought in on an indefinite basis.

Questions & Answers
Question: Can higher taxes contribute to a fairer society?
Answer: Proponents argue that progressive taxes are an effective method for redistributing wealth and creating a fairer society through reducing financial disparities. Opponents argue that higher taxes unfairly penalize earners, act as a disincentive, and reduce the amount of money that businesses can reinvest.

should we raise taxes on the rich?
*Updated 2021
Debate over taxes on the wealthiest Americans is nothing new, but it’s as relevant a topic as ever. It was a major focus of the 2020 US presidential election campaign among democratic candidates, with discussion over the moral, fiscal and economic consequences of raising tax rates on high earners. President Joe Biden has made it known that he plans to increase top income tax rates, and a group of 83 super-rich individuals themselves called for higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for Covid-19 recovery.A recent poll shows that a majority of Americans support the idea of America’s wealthiest paying more taxes. But just because the majority of Americans want to tax the rich more doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right.
Here are three arguments for raising taxes on the rich, and three arguments against it.
We should tax the rich more
It makes economic sense
Taxing the rich to pay for programs that help the poor and middle class (or on things like infrastructure or national defense, which benefit all Americans) makes common sense economically, especially during a pandemic. Very simply, money allocated to programs such as affordable healthcare, Pell grants, food stamps, and Earned Income Tax Credit – or given to working- and middle-class Americans through tax cuts – will be redistributed into the economy and stimulate growth. Tax hikes on the rich would have little impact on their spending, since most of this income would likely have gone into savings.
History bears this out. President Clinton raised the top marginal income tax rate from 31 to 39.6 percent and saw GDP growth top 4 percent every year in his second term. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts were supposed to accelerate growth but, instead, they led to unimpressive growth and eventually recession.
It’s about fairness!
The rich, by definition, have a lot of money. In fact, the top 1 percent in the US holds 15 times more wealth than the bottom 50 percent combined. Meanwhile, 34 million Americans live in poverty, with half a million homeless on any given night.
Even with higher tax rates (and fewer loopholes), the country’s wealthiest will be fine; billionaires like Bill Gates and conservative Mark Cuban, among others, attest to this, having said they would be willing to pay more in taxes. For the government to provide basic housing, nourishment, health care and education to the rest of its citizens, the money must come from somewhere. For the most fortunate to fail to pay their fair share would be a moral failure.
They’re already low (compared to the past)
Let’s take a look at tax rates over time. A tax reform bill that became law in 2018 set new tax rates for Americans, lowering rates for most brackets, including the wealthy, by 1-4 percent. In fact, these tax cuts helped billionaires pay less taxes than the working class. In 2015, that year’s top tax rate was less than half the 91 percent it was under President Eisenhower, a Republican. The top rate was consistently 70 percent or higher until the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s, and those cuts resulted in the national debt tripling in eight years.
We shouldn’t tax the rich more
It’s about fairness!
First, let’s define fairness. Fairness means that Americans reap the rewards of their labor, that what they earn inherently belongs to them and not to the government to redistribute as it sees fit, and that the path to prosperity is through hard work and success. Even through a flat tax, under which the rich pay the same tax rate as lower earners, the wealthy will still end up paying more in absolute terms since they have a higher amount of income to tax. But by any reasonable definition, the amount paid by the rich is already beyond their “fair share .” For example, in 2015, the top 1 percent earned 16.5 percent of income, but paid a staggering 43.6 percent of federal income tax. Meanwhile, more than 44% of Americans pay no federal income tax at all. Entrepreneurs and business owners should not be penalized for their success.
It makes no economics sense
Forcing a small slice of Americans to bear an inordinate burden of funding the government is not just immoral but also counterproductive; it kills jobs, and sometimes even results in lower government revenue. Raising taxes on the rich creates a disincentive for work and job creation, slowing down both. If higher taxes discourage a business from opening or expanding, it is not just the rich who suffer but also the workers who are not hired.
Further, this means that tax hikes often do not have the intended effect of raising revenue. If high taxes slow down economic growth, the government ends up taxing a smaller amount of money at a higher rate. Sometimes, this means a tax hike actually leads to lower total revenues, but even in less extreme cases, tax hikes yield diminishing returns.
They’re already high (compared to other developed countries)
In the past, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in 2018, the US was in bad company. Only the United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich Middle Eastern country with fewer people than Michigan, Puerto Rico, a US territory, and Comoros had higher top corporate tax rates than seen in the US. Now, the US rates among the UK (20 percent), China (25 percent) and Canada (28 percent).
Before the corporate tax reduction, other countries had a competitive advantage over the US when looking to attract businesses. This is no longer the case and shows that raising tax rates may accelerate this trend, and every time a company moves overseas, it costs the US both jobs and tax revenue.
The Bottom Line: Those who favor higher taxes on the wealthy believe it makes economic sense and see virtue in some redistribution of wealth. Their free-market opponents not only see this as wrong-headed government intervention but also believe the economic consequences will hurt the rich and the poor alike. Do you think taxes should be raised on the rich, or should the status quo be preserved?

Many people are strongly debating whether or not the rich should pay higher taxes. I believe it should be that the rich do pay higher taxes.  When times in the economy are rough, the government needs to look  consider at how they could bring in more money. Charging the wealthy higher taxes could be a strategy the government could use., and the wealthy people are the ones who could afford it.  But, taxing the rich more also wouldn’t be impartial that fair because the government already wastes much of the money  pay they collect.

The rich are the ones who benefit the most from the government. Those big corporations and industries make billions of dollars from the public, and guess who owns them, rich people. So how do we solve our problem? You can’t make the poor pay more taxes, they don’t have the money. We also can’t really flatten the tax rate fairly because the only way to reduce the riches tax pay is to soak the middle class. That is not reducing the tax rate, we’re just making the middle pay more than the rich, and right now that is what  is exactly happening. I know that most wealthy people work hard for their money, but we have people in the lower class barely getting by while the wealthy people throw around hundred dollar bills and don’t care about what anyone else thinks. They waste their money on things they don’t need while people in the lower classes struggle everyday. People that have financial disadvantages live paycheck to paycheck while the wealthy people just walk around with lots of money that they’ll waste on things they don’t need such as gold marbled tiles or million dollar perfumes.

As stated in the text,”In truth, it is more than a coin—it is a piece of American culture.” Even though the penny has some culture, culture is nothing compared to losing money the losing money part is way more important than just being part of American culture. This shows how people can hold onto the smallest things for the dumbest reasons. Another thing stated in the text was,”Still, for many people, the penny's sentimental value remains the same.” Even though the penny may have some sentimental value the government is losing a ton of money minting new pennies because they cost more than they have in value.

Many of these arguments are actually myths, according to economist Robert Reich.

Can we all agree? Conservatives hate taxes, especially on the rich, and prefer to cut them. Progressives prefer to raise taxes.
There are many reasons for the differences, but it all gets down to the question of freedom. Conservatives believe freedom arises from few government regulations while progressives believe freedom comes from helping those on the bottom of the status spectrum to gain more power through more income and education.
Let’s examine some conservative views about taxes and contrast them with those of Robert Reich, economist, college professor, author and political commentator. Reich served under three presidents, two Democrats and one Republican. He was U.S. Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton. The source of my information is Reich’s video entitled “12 Myths about Raising Taxes on the Rich.”
Myth No. 1: “A top marginal tax rate applies to all of a person’s wealth.” In other words, if there is a 70 percent marginal rate on income, 70 percent of their income would be taken for taxes.
Reich disagrees, saying the 70 percent tax would only kick in at annual income of $10 million or more. This is Alexandra Ocasio Cortez’s proposal. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal of 2 percent begins at incomes greater than $50 million. Only a small percentage of the population would be affected by these taxes.
Myth No. 2: “Raising taxes on the rich is a far-left idea.”
Reich says “baloney.” Fifty-four percent of Republicans favor raising taxes for those earning $10 million per year, according to a Jan. 24, 2019, Fox News poll. It was federal law from 1930-1978 that those in the top income bracket paid an average of 78 percent in taxes. From 1951 to 1963, the tax rate was 90 percent, again on dollars above a very high amount. Even counting all the tax deductions and credits, the rich paid only 50 percent of their top incomes in taxes. Yet, at these times of high taxes on the rich, the nation was prosperous and workers had good-paying jobs.
Conservatives calling tax increases “socialistic” is also deceptive. Socialism provides roads, fire and police protection, schools and military. Be careful of this word being used to confuse and to stir up emotions.
As Reich points out, it’s the rich who resist paying higher taxes. They’re the ones who come up with reasons why they shouldn’t have to pay more, using emotional words and phrases like “socialism” and “freedom” and being taxed at 70 percent of their income, which is not accurate. Words matter.
Myth No. 3: “A wealth tax is unconstitutional.”
Reich says “rubbish.” Property taxes are wealth taxes. The more valuable one’s house the greater the tax. Home ownership is a prime driver of wealth in the U.S. The wealthy hold most of their wealth in stocks and bonds. They are considered tax exemptions and not counted as income. But these forms of wealth escape taxation as income unless they are sold. Why should this be allowed? Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress power to lay and collect taxes. How, then, could a wealth tax be deemed unconstitutional by the wealthy?
Myth No. 4: “When taxes on the rich are cut, they invest more, and when taxes are increased, economic growth slows.” If the wealthy are highly taxed, they quit investing. It has a trickle-down effect on the economy.
Reich responds by saying, “utter baloney.” Trickle-down economics is a “cruel joke.” Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Donald Trump all cut taxes on the rich and money didn’t trickle down. Also, there’s simply no evidence that shows that raising taxes on the rich slows economic growth. In fact, during times of high economic growth between the 1950 and 2010, when the top marginal tax rate was high, for example, between 71 and 92 percent, growth averaged 4 percent per year. Yet, when the tax rate was low, between 28 to 39 percent, annual growth averaged only 2.1 percent.
Conservatives can offer rebuttals for each of these arguments and I hope they will. As an example, Brian Domitrovic, a conservative history professor at Sam Houston University, argued in another video entitled, “Why High Taxes Benefit the Rich,” and strongly disagrees. He argues that the 1950s brought a period of four recessions where the growth rate between 1949-1960 averaged only 2.5 percent. That’s true, but Reich used a longer period – from 1950-2010 – for his argument.
Our task as readers and listeners is to pay close attention to what statistics are being used for which time periods. Discernment and intelligence are increased when we can compare and contrast varying views. Frankly, Reich’s longer period gives a more accurate picture of economic growth.
Reich’s myth-busting arguments will be continued in a later column. If you haven’t yet seen your pet argument for or against taxing the rich, stay tuned.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can gather from these documents.

From Doc 1, it's an essay about taxes, specifically debating whether richer individuals should be taxed more heavily. The author argues that the pros outweigh the cons, mentioning that higher taxes on the wealthy can be better for the economy and promote social equality. They also bring up the idea that wealthy people owe it to society because their success is partly due to the conditions and opportunities provided by society.

Doc 2 is from Soapboxie.com and presents a list of seven reasons why we should tax the rich more and six reasons why we shouldn't. The pros include that the rich can afford it, that it can prevent wealth discrepancies, and that it's a form of wealth redistribution to help the poor. The cons argue that the government wastes money, that higher taxes discourage investment and economic growth, and that it can lead to a class divide.

Doc 3 is from The Perspective and also lists three arguments for and against raising taxes on the rich. The arguments for include that it makes economic sense, it's fair, and that current tax rates are historically low. Arguments against suggest that it's unfair to punish success, that it hinders economic growth, and that U.S. tax rates are already low compared to other developed countries.

Doc 4 seems to be an essay arguing that the rich should pay higher taxes, emphasizing that the wealthy benefit more from government services and that they can afford to pay more. The essay also touches on the idea that the poor and middle class struggle while the rich waste money on luxuries.

Doc 5 is an opinion piece from the Courier-Herald, where the author, Richard Elfers, discusses myths about taxing the rich, drawing from economist Robert Reich's views. The author debunks several myths, such as the idea that higher taxes on the rich stifle investment and slow economic growth, presenting data that suggests the opposite.

Okay, so from these documents, I can see that the debate around taxing the rich more is complex and has valid points on both sides. Let me try to summarize the main pros and cons based on these sources.

Starting with the pros:

1. **Economic Benefits:** Higher taxes on the rich can stimulate economic growth because the money collected can be used for public services and infrastructure, which in turn can create jobs and improve living standards.

2. **Fairness and Redistributive Justice:** The rich have benefited disproportionately from society's resources and opportunities, so they should contribute more to support those who are less fortunate.

3. **Reducing Inequality:** By taxing the rich more, we can reduce the wealth gap, which is beneficial for social stability and can prevent social unrest.

4. **Historical Precedent:** In the past, when tax rates for the wealthy were higher, economic growth was robust, suggesting that high taxes on the rich do not necessarily hinder economic performance.

Now, moving on to the cons:

1. **Government Waste:** Increasing taxes might not be effective if the government is inefficient and wastes the additional revenue.

2. **Disincentive to Work and Invest:** Higher taxes could discourage high earners from working as hard or investing as much, potentially leading to slower economic growth.

3. **Brain Drain:** Wealthy individuals and businesses might relocate to countries with lower tax rates, taking their investment and jobs with them.

4. **Unfair Punishment of Success:** Taxing the rich more could be seen as punishing those who have worked hard and succeeded, which goes against the principles of meritocracy and personal achievement.

5. **Already High Tax Contributions:** The rich already pay a significant portion of taxes, sometimes more than their proportionate share of income, so increasing taxes further might be unnecessary.

Considering these points, it seems that the decision to tax the rich more should be based on a careful balance between promoting social equity and ensuring that such measures do not negatively impact economic growth and investment. It's also important to consider how the additional revenue will be used and whether there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the money is spent efficiently.

Perhaps a more nuanced approach could involve not just raising tax rates but also closing loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid paying their fair share. Additionally, investing in education and opportunities for the less affluent could help reduce inequality in the long run.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments both for and against taxing the rich more, it's crucial to approach this issue with a comprehensive understanding of its potential impacts on the economy and society as a whole.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Taxing the rich more has pros such as stimulating economic growth, promoting fairness, and reducing inequality, but cons include potential government waste, discouraging investment, and punishing success. A balanced approach considering these factors is essential.}} \]
