So I've been asked about what causes anti-science attitudes. Hmm, this is an interesting and somewhat complex topic. I need to think carefully about this.

First off, I should probably define what is meant by "anti-science attitudes." I guess it refers to skepticism or rejection of scientific methods, findings, or authorities, especially in areas where science has a lot to say, like climate change, vaccines, or evolution. So, people who hold beliefs that go against scientific consensus can be said to have anti-science attitudes.

Now, why would people do that? There must be various reasons behind rejecting scientific evidence. I think it's important to approach this with an open mind and consider multiple perspectives.

One possible cause could be a lack of understanding of science. Maybe some people don't know how science works, so they mistrust it. Science can be complicated, and not everyone has a strong background in it. So, if they don't understand something, they might reject it. Maybe better education could help here.

But then again, I've read studies that show that more education doesn't always lead to more acceptance of science. In fact, sometimes better-educated people can be more polarized in their views, especially on politically charged issues. So, maybe ignorance isn't the only factor.

Another thing that comes to mind is trust in institutions. If people don't trust scientists or the government, they might not believe what they say about scientific matters. For example, if there's a history of misconduct or fraud in science, that could erode public trust.

Religion could also play a role. Some scientific theories, like evolution, directly contradict religious beliefs. So, people who take their religions seriously might feel compelled to reject evolution in favor of creationism or intelligent design. Similarly, beliefs about the nature of the universe or human origins can clash with scientific explanations.

Cultural and social factors might be important too. People often adopt the beliefs of the groups they identify with. So, if their community or social circle rejects certain scientific ideas, they might do the same to fit in or maintain group cohesion.

Political ideology seems to be a big factor as well. In many countries, including the US, political affiliation correlates with beliefs about issues like climate change or vaccine safety. For instance, conservative politicians might downplay the risks of climate change, and their supporters might follow suit.

Media also plays a role. The way scientific issues are reported can influence public perception. Sometimes, media outlets might present conflicting studies or give equal airtime to both sides of an argument, even if one side is not supported by the majority of scientists. This can confuse the public and make them think that there's more disagreement among scientists than there actually is.

Moreover, the internet has made it easier for misinformation to spread. People can find websites or social media groups that confirm their preexisting beliefs, regardless of whether those beliefs are backed by science. This echo chamber effect can reinforce anti-scientific attitudes.

I should also consider psychological factors. Some people might resist scientific information because it threatens their worldview or identity. For example, accepting that human activities are causing climate change might require acknowledging that we need to make significant lifestyle changes, which can be uncomfortable.

Confirmation bias is another psychological trait that could contribute to anti-science attitudes. People tend to seek out information that confirms what they already believe and ignore evidence that contradicts their views.

Perhaps cognitive biases in general play a role. For instance, the Dunning-Kruger effect suggests that people with less knowledge in a area overestimate their competence, so they might think they understand science just as well as experts do.

Interesting. Maybe I should look into some studies or articles that explore these issues further. It would be helpful to have some data to back up these ideas.

The reasons for science skepticism can be complex and founded on real concerns

The reasons for science skepticism can be complex and founded on real concerns
by Gabriele Contessa, The Conversation
Empathy is needed to understand and combat science skepticism. Credit: Shutterstock
A popular internet meme juxtaposes a picture of a female scientist working in a lab captioned "Vaccine Research" with that of a woman looking at her smart phone while sitting on the toilet captioned "Anti-Vax Research." The meme reflects an attitude towards science skepticism in general and vaccine hesitancy in particular.
This attitude automatically brands all those who harbor doubts about the scientific consensus on a certain topic as "anti-vaxxers," "climate skeptics" or "science deniers," and chalks up their unwillingness to accept the scientific consensus to some combination of ignorance, stupidity, recklessness and selfishness.
As I have argued in my academic work in philosophy, some of these genuine concerns can only be addressed by profound and extensive social and political reforms. Addressing the concerns of the science skeptics requires more than attempting to persuade them to trust science—it also requires us as a society to take the social and political steps required to increase the trustworthiness of science.
Dismissal and disrespect
While it might be often tempting to attribute moral or cognitive flaws to those we disagree with, we have at least three very good reasons to resist that temptation.
The first is that these dismissive attitudes towards science skeptics are condescending and disrespectful to our fellow citizens, and they are likely to contribute further to the polarization of our society and to the wear and tear of its social fabric.
The second reason is that the assumption that science skeptics are ignorant or stupid is not supported by the evidence which seems to indicate, for example, that highly educated people are no less likely to doubt science than people with lower levels of education.
The last (but not the least) reason is that these attitudes are likely to be ineffective if not counterproductive. Instead of looking down on the science skeptics, we should listen to them and try to understand their actual concerns, so that we can take appropriate and effective steps to address them.
Reasons for hesitancy
Russian author Leo Tolstoy wrote, "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way ." Something similar could be said about trust in science. As a thought exercise, consider the examples of Savita, Maya and Lara, three highly educated middle-aged women. While each of them is somewhat hesitant about vaccines, their hesitancy has different roots and takes different shapes.
Savita, who is of South Asian descent and is in a heterosexual marriage, believes that her son's severe allergies were triggered by a shot he was given a couple of days before his first allergic reaction and, while her doctor has tried to reassure her that it was just a coincidence, she is not convinced and is not willing to take any more risks with her children's health.
Maya, who is Black and in a same-sex relationship, distrusts a medical system that has a record of discrimination against both Black people and members of the LGBTQ+ community.
Lara, who is white and single, does not believe that the vaccines against COVID-19 have been properly tested, and feels that they have only been granted emergency approval due to the clout that the pharmaceutical industry has with politicians and regulators.
While these may be common fears about the COVID-19 vaccines, they were properly tested and evaluated, and adverse events, including allergy and anaphylaxis, remain low.
The dominant approach to addressing science skepticism assumes that science skeptics either do not understand how science works or are ignorant of the existence of a scientific consensus on the relevant issues. According to this view, vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by doctors reassuring patients on the medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective.
However, to patients like Savita, Maya and Lara, these wholesale reassurances are likely to ring hollow, as they fail to address their own personal concerns. Attempts to address hesitancy are also likely to come across as patronizing, as they suggest that their recipients are ignorant or reckless.
Complex phenomenon
Looking down on the science skeptics and talking down to them is much easier than trying to understand and address their concerns, even when some of those concerns are legitimate. The medical system does display a bias against marginalized social groups. The relationship between the pharmaceutical industry with medical doctors and biomedical researchers does raise serious concerns about conflicts of interest.
Even focusing only on vaccine hesitancy, science skepticism is a complex and varied phenomenon. Tarring all science skeptics with the same brush makes us lose sight of the differences between them, leaves us unable to understand the many different roots of their distrust, and leads us to adopt a wrongheaded one-size-fit all approach to addressing them.

The New Anti-Science Movement
The New Anti-Science Movement
Ronald Merrill|From the January 1973 issue
One of the most surprising—and discouraging—developments of recent times is the revival of the anti-science movement. For a while it seemed that the attitudes which produced the Scopes trial, the Inquisition, "Aryan Science", and the like had finally passed into history. But today the attack on science has been renewed, in a new form and with amazing success. It is, as Ayn Rand has called it,[1] an anti-industrial revolution, a frontal assault on progress and civilization as such.
The incredible thing about the anti-science movement is its mere existence in modern times. To convince the people of a technological society that science—to which most of them literally owe their lives—is evil would seem an impossible task. Yet this seeming impossibility is actually an advantage—for, because of it, those who attack science are not taken seriously. What we now hear is: "Well, they don't really want to abolish technology, just limit it a little." But the basic idea has become established, and that is what counts. The time is not yet ripe for "Les savants au bucher!"— but the time is coming.
What does it mean to speak of an "anti-science" movement? We are not primarily concerned here with philosophical attacks on the validity of scientific method, nor with the occasional claim, already being heard again, that science as such is evil. Instead, we shall focus on the increasingly successful attempts to indict science by blaming it for real or imaginary evils it has allegedly created.
ANTI-PROGRESS
The anti-science movement might better be called the anti-progress movement, because actually it attacks innovation at every stage, from the laboratory to the production line. It attacks research in genetics, space exploration,[2] and automotive style changes—all on the same grounds, that progress is bad. But the basic objective is science, for the simple reason that if one shuts off the faucet, one doesn't need to worry about dealing with the hose.
It is no coincidence that a cutback in scientific research has occurred at the same time that science has become a public whipping boy. Government policies—notably in the field of patents—have made it very difficult for private industry to make a profit on basic research. As a result, most such research is now done with government funds. Over the last few years this support has been substantially reduced—and that is an impressive measure of public dislike of science, for a government program has to be very unpopular indeed before its funding will be cut.[3]
GUERRILLA WARFARE
Yet the attack on science is seldom explicit. What is occurring now is the first phase of a philosophical guerrilla war: sniping, raids on outlying posts, an occasional terrorist attack. The objective at this point is to weaken the enemy's will to resist, while simultaneously building a basis for a later direct attack. Already considerable progress has been made toward both these goals. Many scientists have openly joined the attack on science. And a surprising number of libertarians, who argue confidently and competently with statists when the issue is the draft or anti-trust laws, suddenly become embarrassed and apologetic when the subject turns to "ecology".
The basic technique used in the attack on science is a familiar one: the Method of the Poisoned Antidote. Problems caused by statism, by lack of technical knowledge, or by failure to apply that knowledge when available, are simply blamed on "unrestricted technology". This can be very effective, because the average person has little if any acquaintance with even the most elementary scientific principles.
TYPES OF ATTACKS
Rand identifies anti-science with the so-called "Ecology Movement". But in fact, this is only part of a wide range of attacks, which might be roughly classified as follows:
1) Attacks on basic research, particularly in genetics and nuclear physics, because it results in knowledge or capabilities that "man shouldn't have".
2) Attacks on basic or applied research (space exploration is an obvious example) because it is "useless" and "diverts resources from higher priorities".
3) Attacks on the use of technology because it is "dehumanizing".
4) Most important, attacks on science technology because, it is claimed, it is destructive.
We are going to concentrate on the fourth class of attack, because it is relatively recent and more effective than the other criticisms of science. However, a little should be said about the revival of the "traditional" objections to science.
The ancient, mystical opposition to eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge has strong support among liberals and even some libertarians, who fear the use of, say, nuclear weapons or mind-controlling drugs by the State. Convinced that technology which can be used for coercion sooner or later will be so used, they advocate avoiding the possibility by preventing research in these areas. In addition, pacifists oppose any research which could lead to military weapons, religious groups object to genetic research which usurps the prerogatives of their deities, and so on. The "hard mystic" position that knowledge as such is evil has little support now. However, the "soft mystic" argument, that knowledge (or some knowledge) is potentially so dangerous it shouldn't be known, is becoming increasingly prominent. Both positions are similar, however, in that they object to science and technology because they give man a choice— the choice to use science to do good or evil, and the responsibility to make the correct decision.
The claim that science is useless also has a long and dishonorable history. One would think that the case for the utility of science has been proved beyond all doubt. Yet basic research is still vulnerable to the question "What good is it?" Benjamin Franklin's reply[4] fails to satisfy those who do not understand how the useful invention of today is based on the "useless, abstract research" of yesterday. Thus we now see strong public support for switching efforts from basic to applied research. The failure of this policy in other countries—notably the Soviet Union—is of course carefully ignored.[5]
Claims that technology is "dehumanizing"—whatever that means—can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. Today there is a strong and growing "back to nature" movement—"natural foods", "organic gardening", communes, etc., are increasingly popular. Most emphasis seems to be placed on food, and for good reason: in pre-technological societies, the average man's main concern in life was averting starvation.
On a somewhat loftier level, intellectuals in the humanities have long attacked science for its alleged tendency to make people less "human" and have created the stereotype of the robotlike scientist who feels neither pleasure nor pain. This is the starting point of Snow's "two cultures"—the separation of, and hostility between, the "humanistic" and scientific cultures.[6] As Asimov has pointed out[7], this hostility is the sole responsibility of the "humanists". He discusses several possible motives for their attack on science; however, both he and Snow miss one of the major factors. Much of what passes for erudition in the humanities is sheer bluff. The average college English professor lives with the unadmitted fear of exposure as an intellectual fraud—and the man most likely to expose him is the scientist, the real intellectual.
ENVIRONMENTALISM EXPOSED
The mainstay of the modern attack on science is the claim that technology is destructive; that progress has such dangerous side-effects that it should be abolished, or at least limited. The specific claims range from simple, "big lie" propaganda (such as the campaign against the Amchitka nuclear test) to honest, scientifically accurate studies by sincere scientists who are merely ignorant of economic or political principles. The political implementation of these claims is accomplished primarily by means of the "Environmentalist" movement.
"Environmentalism" is a political movement which has resulted from the penetration and take-over of conservationism—just as, say, syndicalism resulted from the similar take-over of the early union movement by Marxism. The pattern is the same in both cases—the exploitation of rational grievances by irrationalist groups in order to obtain political power. (In the same way, some "consumerists" cash in on the reputation of groups such as Consumer's Union.)
MISPLACED LOYALTY
Now, analyzing the anti-science movement is a good deal more difficult than analyzing, say, Communism or Fascism. One cannot, for instance, say: "here are the basic principles of environmentalism; let us examine them…"—because those principles are seldom if ever explicitly admitted. The essence of the movement is the combination of vague, lofty "ideals" with very specific political demands. A further problem results from the structure of the movement. This consists of three groups: a small number of anti-science intellectuals who provide the basic ideas and set the direction of the movement; a very large group of supporters, who follow uncritically because they are ignorant of science; and finally, a considerable number of competent intellectuals, not anti-science and legitimately concerned with environmental problems. It is the purpose of this article to detach the third group from their misplaced loyalty to the first group.
Rand[1] has provided a good analysis of the fundamental premises—the "why"—of the anti-science movement. This article will focus on the "how". The examples given below were obtained simply by going over a few months' back issues of several technical magazines. They are not carefully selected exceptions, but typical cases which illustrate some of the techniques and issues which are currently being exploited in the attack on technology.
ATTACK ON DDT
One of the most highly publicized issues of environmentalism is the use of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides and herbicides. DDT and 2,4,5-T have come in for the most criticism, the latter especially because of its use in Viet Nam. This issue provides some very clear-cut examples of propaganda techniques, so we will examine it at some length.
Let us begin by considering an anti-DDT leaflet printed by the National Audobon Society. Now, the Audobon Society is generally considered a respectable conservationist group, so it comes as something of a shock to see how low they have fallen. They begin by asking rhetorically "What's wrong with DDT?"; they then answer their own question and go on to recommend that the reader use other pesticides—which they name—a serious mistake. For instance, they say DDT "is harmful to wildlife, killing some animals outright and inhibiting reproduction in others". In fact, DDT has a very low toxicity to mammals, but may inhibit reproduction in some birds. However, the pesticides urged by Audobon to replace DDT, which include such compounds as nicotine sulfate, do kill animals outright—including birds. Again: DDT "affects our food supply; our fisheries are particularly vulnerable…use only such sprays as…rotenone.…" Consider this recommendation in the light of a passage from an Air Force survival manual[8]: "Catching fish by poisoning them is quite practical if you have the right poison, the most common being the well-known rotenone, the active ingredient in many insecticides. If properly used, one ounce of 12 percent rotenone (also called derris) will kill every fish for half a mile downstream in a stream 25 feet wide." Or again: "while the amount of DDT now in our bodies is small and has not yet proved harmful, scientists fear possible long range effects". As one alternative to DDT, Audobon proposes malathion, an organo-phosphorus compound closely related to the nerve gases; it is responsible for numerous accidental deaths. (DDT apparently has never killed a single human being, although literally whole populations have been dusted with it to control body lice.)
COMMON FALLACY
This is a prime example of a very common technique, which might be called "the fallacy of the ignored alternatives". This consists of citing an evil—or alleged evil—and proposing a solution, without examining the possible consequences of implementing the solution. In the specific case of DDT, two alternatives are commonly advocated. Replacement of DDT with other pesticides (the Audobon Society solution) has a very simple drawback: other pesticides are much more toxic than DDT—and because they are less persistent, higher levels must be maintained in the local environment. The result, easily predicted[9], would be more deaths for humans and wildlife. Another possibility is simply to stop using pesticides altogether. (Yes, that has been seriously advocated.) This idea has been examined by Dr. Norman Borlaug, perhaps the only person ever to actually earn the Nobel Peace Prize (he got it for his development of high-yield wheat strains, part of the "green revolution"): "Let's get our priorities in perspective. As much as I favor wildlife, man must come first. We must feed ourselves and protect ourselves against the health hazards of the world. To do that, we must have agricultural chemicals. Without them, the world population will starve."[10]
The pesticides issue is a gold mine of environmentalist fallacies and argumentative techniques. To cover a few very briefly:
• The use of exaggerated claims and apocalyptic predictions— often based on speculation rather than research. Thus, for instance, it has been claimed that TCDD (an impurity in 2,4,5-T) has an LD 100 of about 1 µg/Kg. This is an utterly ridiculous figure; it would make TCDD as toxic as batrachotoxin.[11] Yet many claims such as this are made quite casually.
• Sloppy or hasty research. A good example is eggshell thinning in birds. Newspaper publicity generally states, as an established fact, that DDT is responsible. In fact this is still an area of some controversy.[12] Not only have some experiments been poorly controlled, but the postulated mechanism for DDT intervention in eggshell formation (inhibition of carbonic anhydrase) has been shown false.[13] It has been suggested—only half in jest—that eggshell thinning is due not to DDT but to disturbance of the birds by environmentalists trampling through their nesting grounds to examine their reproduction rates.
• Failure to bother even looking up known facts. Thus it is common for environmentalists to talk about DDT being carried by runoff waters into the ocean. In fact, DDT is removed from the soil mainly by evaporation, and it is about ten times as concentrated in the air (0.1 ppb) as it is in the ocean (0.01 ppb).[14]
• Failure to consider—or even admit—facts in favor of the action under fire. For instance, DDT's low toxicity to mammals—its prime advantage—is systematically ignored in the environmentalist literature. Also ignored is the existence of "modified" DDTs which are biodegradable.[15] Furthermore, some beneficial side-effects have been claimed for chlorinated hydrocarbons. One study indicates that DDT in the diet may help prevent cancer.[16] It has also been claimed that DDT pollution of fresh water moderates mercury pollution by inhibiting the conversion of inorganic to organic mercury.[17] Perhaps most amusing is the case of the chlorinated hydrocarbon 2,4-D. Grasshoppers have adapted to it and apparently use it as starting material to synthesize 2,5-dichlorophenol, which now occurs in their defensive froth.[18]
MERCURY POLLUTION SCARE
Let us examine another case. Mercury pollution is a good example because it illustrates several points: the unity of "ecology" and "consumerism", the problem of standards, and, particularly, the danger of jumping to conclusions.
The whole thing began with some "common sense". It has been known for a long time that mercury is a very toxic substance. But—put a little mercury in a test tube full of water, and what happens? Why, the mercury sinks to the bottom and just sits there. So manufacturers who used mercury didn't worry too much if some escaped into the local river (although, actually, they did—mercury is extremely expensive). Clearly, it would just sink to the bottom and do no harm. However, as often happens when "common sense" is used as an excuse for not doing research, things turned out to be not so simple. Microorganisms convert elemental mercury to organic forms such as methylmercury; it then gets into the food chain.
Now, this is a relatively limited and easy-to-solve environmental problem. Why? First, because mercury is so costly that recovery of spillage tends to pay for itself. Second, because there are very few industrial plants using mercury in large amounts. Third, because it is a fresh water problem only (it would take a hundred million metric tons of mercury to double the concentration in sea-water[19]). However, when high mercury levels were found in fresh-water fish, the FDA hit the panic button. Ocean fish such as tuna and swordfish were found also to contain mercury—and the immediate conclusion was that this was due to pollution. As it turns out, it can be easily proven that mercury in tuna is due to natural biological concentration of oceanic mercury. For one thing, mercury levels are equally high in old—even prehistoric—fish which have been preserved.[20] (The feeble claim[21] that this is due to contamination by impure preservatives is easily refuted.[22]) Incidentally, tuna also concentrates selenium, an element which mitigates the toxicity of mercury.[23] The evidence suggests that the FDA restriction on mercury in food (0.5 ppm) is unreasonably high—unless the purpose is to discourage cannibalism; most Americans have body mercury levels of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm.[24]
FOOD ADDITIVES
Another informative example is the issue of food additives and food contamination. A prominent factor here is the use of "consumer safety" regulations by industry in attempts to eliminate competitors. Let us take a rather trivial case to start with. An improved macaroni with high protein content has been developed. Its appearance on the market has been blocked—the FDA, at the behest of manufacturers of regular—and inferior—macaroni, refuses to allow the new product to be called macaroni.[25]
Many similar but more substantial cases have been publicized recently. The cyclamate and fish-flour issues are so prominent as to need no discussion. In both cases, the FDA banned the use of foodstuffs of known value—the one on very poor scientific evidence, the other on none at all. More recently, saccharin has been taken off the GRAS list (Generally Recognized As Safe). On what basis? Well, twenty rats were fed saccharin at 5% of their diet (2.5 g/kg-day). This is equivalent to an adult human drinking 875 bottles of diet pop a day for life. Three of the rats developed bladder tumors which "appear to be malignant". Who did this research? The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Institute— financed by the International Sugar Research Fund. [26]
The key to this method of suppressing competition is the "Delaney Clause". This law requires the banning of any artificial food additive which can be linked in any way to cancer. (The requirement that the additive be artificial is very possibly the only thing protecting sugar makers from retaliation in kind.)
One might ask why studies at such high concentrations are even considered seriously. The main reason is lack of alternative. If a compound affects, say, one person in a million at normal dosages, one needs literally millions of lab animals to study the effects at that concentration. Obviously the expense would be prohibitive. The only alternative is to study very high dosages, and extrapolate one's results to normal doses.
"NO THRESHOLD" THEORY
Extrapolation, however, is notoriously unreliable. In spite of this well known fact, some scientists and most "consumerists" have adopted the "no threshold" theory. This is the concept that toxicity is never reduced to zero as long as there is any dosage—no matter how small.[27] The problem with this idea is that counterexamples are so easy to find. Take copper, for instance. Cupric sulfate is a deadly poison. Yet, as dosage is decreased, there comes a point where cupric ion is harmless. What's more, below that level, copper has a "negative toxicity"—it is one of the trace elements necessary to human life.
Another obvious problem with the "no threshold" concept is that it can be used to justify banning anything—since any compound is toxic at a sufficiently high dosage. An article[28] on "Sanity in Research and Evaluation of Environmental Health" gives some examples:
If man is prohibited from consuming foodstuffs because of their content of natural toxins, where will it end? Honey contains the potent grayanotoxins (given intraperitoneally, a dose lethal to 50 percent of the animals tested is approximately 1 milligram per kilogram.) German raisins have been found to be teratogenic, while caffeine and tannin are tumorigenic; nutmeg, parsley, and dill are highly toxic because of their myristicin and apiole contents. Vitamin C has produced tumors in mice.
It seems clear that a more reasonable standard is needed for evaluating foodstuff toxicity—or at least some standard. At present, decisions concerning the use of food additives appear to be made on the basis of publicity and political rather than scientific considerations.
AIR POLLUTION
We may also consider some examples from the field of air pollution. The case of carbon monoxide provides an instance of the dangers of drawing conclusions from inadequate research. Enough is produced by man to double the ambient level in the atmosphere in about 5 years[29]—yet the actual level appears to be declining.[30] Why? Because carbon monoxide is taken up by soil bacteria as fast as it is formed.[31]
Sulfur dioxide affords some even more amusing results. It is presently the "leading" air pollutant in terms of publicity and removal efforts. This has occurred for two reasons: 1) it is highly "visible"—having a strong odor, high acidity, and rather high concentrations due to the widespread occurrence of sulfur in coal and oil; 2) it is relatively easy to abate by using low-sulfur fuels and scrubbing exhaust gases. It comes as rather a surprise to learn that sulfur dioxide at pollution levels is reported to be harmless to mammals[32]—and possibly even beneficial.[33] This is a prime example of a common procedure in environmentalism: pouncing on a target of convenience, often at the expense of efforts to attack really serious problems.
Consider the case of air pollution in general. We can imagine two possible extremes in measuring the degree of air pollution: in terms of pollutant concentrations in the troposphere as a whole, or in terms of pollution of the air that is actually breathed by humans. The latter is clearly more significant, but environmentalists have been much more concerned with approximating the former. A little thought shows why: the average American spends most of his time indoors, and almost certainly the major source of pollution in the air he breathes is due to cigarette smoke—if he is a nonsmoker. For smokers, of course, all other types of air pollution pale into insignificance. (Recently it was discovered that cigarettes are a major source of the very toxic heavy metal cadmium in man.[34] A single cigarette contains 1-2 micrograms, of which the smoker absorbs about half; the other people in the room with him get the rest.) But when environmentalists talk about air pollution, tobacco is never mentioned—for obvious reasons.
DETERGENT POLLUTION
The detergent controversy is a typical case of environmentalists going off at half-cock and introducing a cure worse than the original evil. The first detergents were of the sulfonate type; they were adopted because of their numerous advantages over soap. Unfortunately, as detergent use increased, disadvantages became apparent. Detergents could ruin septic tanks. Moreover, the sulfonate detergents have long environmental half-lives, and thus rivers into which sewage was poured tended to become sudsy. Under heavy pressure from the proto-environmentalists, detergent manufacturers switched to phosphates, which were enthusiastically advertised as "biodegradable". However, "biodegradable" merely means "edible to microorganisms", and with all this extra nourishment, algae growth soon was getting out of hand. Eutrophication became the word of the day. It was then proposed to replace phosphates with NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid). This fortunately has been stopped by an alleged health hazard; environmentalists have ignored evidence that a switch to NTA could increase eutrophication. (It now seems likely that nitrogen has replaced phosphorus as the limiting reagent for algae growth in many waterways, and NTA contains nitrogen.)[35]
All this mess is due to the desperate desire of environmentalists to avoid naming the real source of detergent pollution: municipal governments that dump raw or partially treated sewage into their local rivers. Thus the attempts to pin the blame on industry and demand that it come up with a "non-polluting" detergent; unfortunately, there is no such thing.
SEA POLLUTION
Pollution of the sea by petroleum is another focus of environmentalist concern. It is generally casually assumed that accidental oil spills are the chief culprit. In fact, in 1969, accidental spills accounted for only about one percent of oceanic oil pollution. The major contributor (53%) was atmospheric fallout from industrial and auto exhausts.[36] It is again a case of attacking the visible rather than the dangerous foe—major oil spills create spectacular, but local and temporary effects.
A related problem goes virtually unmentioned by environmentalists: each year in the U.S., over a billion gallons of used motor oil is dumped or burned. Rerefining is discouraged by a special tax on the process.[37]
ANTI-NUCLEAR CRUSADE
Let us take one more example. The attack on the use of nuclear power provides a graphic example of the effects of scientific ignorance. One would expect, since fossil fuel power plants are major polluters, that environmentalists would be strong supporters of atomic energy. In fact, they have concentrated some of their most energetic efforts against the building of power reactors. Why? Because the weapon—the public's superstitious fear of atomic energy—is convenient to hand.
The actual motives of the anti-nuclear crusade become clear when we consider the professed motives. What specific objections could be raised to nuclear power?
• Thermal pollution: A nuclear reactor, because of its lower operating temperature, produces about twice as much waste heat as a fossil fuel power plant of the same output. However, this could actually be an asset rather than a liability, because this heat can be put to use. For instance, in London there is a reactor whose excess heat is used to provide hot water for local homes. It has also been proposed to use a reactor's thermal output to produce an upward blast of hot air which could break up atmospheric inversions and thus alleviate smog. But most such schemes require locating the reactor in the city—and people are afraid it will explode. (It can't—but most people don't know that.)
• Release of radioactivity: Well, some simple figures[38]: humans in the United States are exposed to 2 x 10 7 rems/year due to medical X-rays alone; one power reactor results in a total exposure of about 40 rems/year. Yet Paul Ehrlich, a prominent environmentalist, has claimed that radioactive effluents into the sea from an unspecified reactor have made some oysters so radioactive they glow in the dark.[39] (His reaction when told the statement was false: "It doesn't make any difference."[40])[41]
• Disposal of radioactive wastes: This is the one presently unsolved problem with nuclear power. There is, however, a long-term solution on the horizon: rocketing the long-lived wastes into the sun. In the meantime, storage problems appear capable of solution.
• Accidental release of radioactivity: Most attacks are based on a simple principle—nobody can prove that an accident won't happen someday. Atomic energy's excellent safety record so far is simply ignored; of course.[42]
These are the real issues involved in the use of nuclear power. When we consider them in the context of the typical anti-reactor campaign, it is clear that so much uncontrollable hysteria could not be aroused by such minor threats. It isn't—it is aroused by simple superstitious fear of the unknown, and the alleged issues merely provide face-saving pretexts. As a final piece of evidence, one might consider the attitude of systematic apathy displayed by most environmentalists toward the development of thermonuclear (fusion) power, which would be even cleaner than fission reactors.
NEED FOR RATIONAL APPROACH
Now, what has been the point of giving all these examples? First, to illustrate the techniques by which it is possible to attack science and still be listened to by sane men. Second, to attempt to demolish the prevalent belief that "the environmentalist movement is basically good, we just have to correct a few excesses." Irrationalist movements of all sorts have repeatedly been protected by this sort of attitude. The Bolsheviks, the Weathermen, the Syndicalists, etc.—all have benefited by preempting a valid goal and then smearing their opponents as enemies of that goal. The environmentalist movement should not simply be reformed—it is rotten at the core, based on an implicitly anti-science ideology. This vital center should be abolished, and replaced with a rational approach.
What is a rational approach? A libertarian position on ecological—and consumer—questions should be based on the following principles:
First: Objectives must be defined. Nobody as yet really knows what constitutes an ideal environment for man, for instance. Environmentalists have deliberately avoided tackling such questions—for obvious reasons. Libertarians, however, should begin by defining terms and establishing principles and standards, rather than using the traditional ad hoc approach.
Second: Problems must be attacked with serious research. The typical technique now is to conduct a cheap, hasty series of experiments, then seize on the incomplete results as justification for a corrective action which often results in even worse problems. Sometimes no research at all in done.[43] In most environmental issues, considerable research is needed just to determine the nature of the problem; even more research is required to identify the cause and find a solution. In short, a rational environmentalist should insist on knowing the facts before taking action.
Third: The present legal and ideological grounds for assigning responsibility for ecological—and consumer—problems must be changed. Courts at present apply the "balancing of interests" test and refuse to consider indirect destruction of another's property by pollution as trespass or arson.[44] Libertarians must insist on the enforcement of property rights as a means of attacking pollution. In most cases, this will result in putting the ultimate blame back squarely where it belongs—on the State.
Fourth: Libertarians must fight the growing politicization of science. This subject deserves an article in its own right. One of the unpleasant by-products of a technological society is the close interaction of science and politics, as technical issues become politically relevant. This is gradually bringing the "real" sciences down to the level of, say, economics—where a Paul Samuelson gets the Nobel Prize, and a Ludwig von Mises is an unknown. There is a growing tendency for scientists to receive recognition and funding on the basis of the political acceptability of their research results—just as is already the case for economists, sociologists, etc. The following process has become familiar: Scientist A concludes, on the basis of massive dosage experiments, that food additive X (or contraceptive Y, or pesticide Z) "may possibly cause cancer". Senator S seizes on this—he is an enemy of the X (or Y or Z) industry—and holds massively publicized hearings. Scientist A's claims appear in the front-page headlines, except that now it's "X (or Y or Z) CAUSES CANCER, SAYS NOTED SCIENTIST". (Scientists B, C, and D, who testified that they couldn't duplicate A's results and don't think his conclusions are correct, are unmentioned by the media.) The Administration, fearful of embarrassment, orders the FDA to ban X (or Y or Z) regardless of the scientific data. The National Science Foundation (who know which side their appropriations bread is buttered on) give Scientist A a $100,000 grant to make further studies. (Scientists B, C, and D may find that they can no longer get grants—or tenure.) The result of all this is that scientists—most of whom are directly or indirectly dependent on the government—tend to become careful not to make public statements contradicting the environmentalist establishment.
This is a disastrous trend; it could lead to an American Lysenkoism and the end of science in this country. It can only be fought by removing science—and scientists—from the control of the federal government. Basic research must be returned to private funding. This would require extensive changes in tax, patent, and education policies.
The lead should be taken—now—by libertarians—nobody else is doing it. What science needs today is not apologists, but defenders.

[43] Another example: Environmentalists strongly promote recycling paper. It has been suggested, however, that this is a poor idea because it saves on renewable resources (notably trees and labor) at the expense of using more nonrenewable mineral resources. Again, I have lost the documentation.

Researchers Say They've Figured Out What Makes People Reject Science, And It's Not Ignorance

Researchers Say They've Figured Out What Makes People Reject Science, And It's Not Ignorance
FIONA MACDONALD
23 JANUARY 2017
A lot happened in 2016, but one of the biggest cultural shifts was the rise of fake news - where claims with no evidence behind them (e.g. the world is flat) get shared as fact alongside evidence-based, peer-reviewed findings (e.g. climate change is happening ).
Researchers have coined this trend the 'anti-enlightenment movement ', and there's been a lot of frustration and finger-pointing over who or what's to blame. But a team of psychologists has identified some of the key factors that can cause people to reject science - and it has nothing to do with how educated or intelligent they are.
In fact, the researchers found that people who reject scientific consensus on topics such as climate change, vaccine safety, and evolution are generally just as interested in science and as well-educated as the rest of us.
The issue is that when it comes to facts, people think more like lawyers than scientists, which means they 'cherry pick' the facts and studies that back up what they already believe to be true.
So if someone doesn't think humans are causing climate change, they will ignore the hundreds of studies that support that conclusion, but latch onto the one study they can find that casts doubt on this view. This is also known as cognitive bias .
"We find that people will take a flight from facts to protect all kinds of belief including their religious belief, their political beliefs, and even simple personal beliefs such as whether they are good at choosing a web browser," said one of the researchers, Troy Campbell from the University of Oregon.
"People treat facts as relevant more when the facts tend to support their opinions. When the facts are against their opinions, they don't necessarily deny the facts, but they say the facts are less relevant."
This conclusion was based on a series of new interviews, as well as a meta-analysis of the research that's been published on the topic, and was presented in a symposium called over the weekend as part of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology annual convention in San Antonio.
The goal was to figure out what's going wrong with science communication in 2017, and what we can do to fix it.
The research has yet to be published, so isn't conclusive, but the results suggest that simply focussing on the evidence and data isn't enough to change someone's mind about a particular topic, seeing as they'll most likely have their own 'facts' to fire back at you.
"Where there is conflict over societal risks - from climate change to nuclear-power safety to impacts of gun control laws, both sides invoke the mantel of science," said one of the team, Dan Kahan from Yale University.
Instead, the researchers recommend looking into the 'roots' of people's unwillingness to accept scientific consensus, and try to find common ground to introduce new ideas.
So where is this denial of science coming from? A big part of the problem, the researchers found, is that people associate scientific conclusions with political or social affiliations.
New research conducted by Kahan showed that people have actually always cherry picked facts when it comes to science - that's nothing new. But it hasn't been such a big problem in the past, because scientific conclusions were usually agreed on by political and cultural leaders, and promoted as being in the public's best interests.
Now, scientific facts are being wielded like weapons in a struggle for cultural supremacy, Kahan told Melissa Healy over at the LA Times, and the result is a "polluted science communication environment".
So how can we do better?
"Rather than taking on people's surface attitudes directly, tailor the message so that it aligns with their motivation," said Hornsey. "So with climate skeptics, for example, you find out what they can agree on and then frame climate messages to align with these."
The researchers are still gathering data for a peer-reviewed publication on their findings, but they presented their work to the scientific community for further dissemination and discussion in the meantime.
Hornsey told the LA Times that the stakes are too high to continue to ignore the 'anti-enlightenment movement'.
"Anti-vaccination movements cost lives," said Hornsey. "Climate change skepticism slows the global response to the greatest social, economic and ecological threat of our time."
"We grew up in an era when it was just presumed that reason and evidence were the ways to understand important issues; not fear, vested interests, tradition or faith," he added.
"But the rise of climate skepticism and the anti-vaccination movement made us realise that these enlightenment values are under attack."

Five Reasons Why People Think They Hate Science (and what to do about it!)
Five Reasons Why People Think They Hate Science (and what to do about it!)
December 20th, 2009
Now, I don’t expect everyone to love everything that I love, but I do know that everyone loves the results of science even if they don’t readily acknowledge it.   I mean, people love using the internet, driving cars, being warm in the winter, getting medicine when they are sick, all that good stuff.   But even if they don’t readilly acknowledge this love for the roots of science, I do understand the hate.   Or I think I do, part of it.
I’ve taught science to non-major students a number of years and also spend my time watching science wars on the internet (e.g., deniers of global warming, evolution, etc.).
I think that countering biases means figuring out misconceptions, confronting them, and knocking them down first thing.   If you don’t hit the misconception, you don’t actually teach anyone anything.   The misconceptions run strong and reassert themselves over time.   So, I want to try to list the issues people have with science, rational and irrational, and want to think about how to respond to and perhaps counter these.
1. Scientists are arrogant, so I don’t like science.
Bush and Clinton are arrogant, so does that mean you don’t like politics?   Simon Cowell on American Idol is arrogant, but he is popular and tens of millions of peolple like that show.   Astronomers Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan don’t come across as arrogant on their TV shows, so maybe everyone can like some science.
2. Science is full of math.   I’m not good at math, so I don’t like science.
Not all sciences have a lot of math (e.g., biology).   Moreover, science concepts are more fundamental than the math.   The science is all in setting up the equations.   The math is in solving them, so you can understand the science without the math.   (P.S. Math isn’t so bad, really!)
3. Science is full of negativity.   Scientists are always doubting things.   It isn’t just arrogance, it’s being pessimistic, skeptical doubters.   So I don’t like science.
This is true, but necessary.   Sometimes it’s better to have a dose of honesty, and not take everything on authority.   Besides, not every idea is right out there, so let’s make a virtue out of honesty, ok?
4. My beliefs are strong, and I have faith.   Science says some things contradictory to my beliefs (e.g. evolution, global warming, autism, etc.), so I don’t like science.
Well, this one is harder I think.   Reality is reality.   Science doesn’t care.   We can be understanding about people in the past, with a different culture and educational background interpreting things as they saw them.   We know better now.   And science, ultimately, is less beholden to any particular belief system or ideology.   Eventually it gets to the right answer, like it or not, and there’s always someone one your side and on the other side who both get bitten by science.   Science is not a belief system.   It reflects reality.   We all have to deal with reality, don’t we?
5. Science is mechanistic and cold, so I don’t like it.
Think of your favorite robot.   The Iron Giant.   Bender.   Data.   Robby.   R2-D2.   HAL.   Okay, maybe not HAL.   But there’s at least one robot out there you like, isn’t there?   Make that the face of cold, mechanical science, if you must.

Actually, biology has a tremendous amount of math, primarily statistics.
Mike Brotherton
December 20, 2009
Yes, you’re right about that of course.  And it doesn’t matter if it isn’t calculus, it’s still very scary to the mathphobic.  There are subfields of many sciences where math isn’t omnipresent — they’re just getting harder to think of!

I suck at match. Thats why I havent become a scientist. But it never made me not LOVE science
actually, there are so many scientists who wrote GREAT BOOKS explaining science with great concepts, without any mathematics, that its quite weird that there are people capable of disliking science because of such thing.
IMHO, the number 1 reason people dislike science its because it PROVES THEM WRONG.
Meaning, they love science when it creates gadgets for them (they dont even aknowledge it as science), but as soon as you question them about some of their unscientific beliefs, they are ready to bash science.

So much of the “I don’t like it” attitude can also be changed by a good instructor. An experience can vary so much within the same subject depending on the enthusiasm and competence of the teacher/professor. Even if the students don’t know the subject well, they can tell if their teacher knows what their doing. This comment is not limited to science. I should also add that some brilliant people in their field should not be in a traditional classroom setting. I think your classes would be interesting and fun!

I just wanna post one comment. When you say “Science is not a belief system.  It reflects reality.”, BE CAREFUL. As a chemistry teacher, I must say that science does NOT represent the truth, but gives another point of view of what goes around us. Nowadays, it’s the most accepted view, but being it constructed over models, it’s not really the truth. Actually, it IS a belief system, whose structure is a bit off of what we are used to. There is no truth. There are ways of seeing it. I like the metaphore of Pozo (spanish educator), when he says science is like a binch of blind people trying to tell how an ellephant is by touch: some will focus on the pawn, others on the nose, and so one, and no one will get the whole picture.

Cool, I love it when people put science in a good light. I’m currently reading Carl Sagan’s The Demon Haunted World, which is fantastic and I recommend the book to everyone.
@ Vitor
I disagree. Science of course does not represent the truth, and yes, it is just another point of view.
However, it is at this moment, THE BEST point of view. It makes more predictions and does its absolute best to provide evidence (and it does) for such claims, more than any other “point of view” on our planet. If science has value then it has some truth to it.

As a former student and a current teacher in a homeschool, I think you missed the main reason science is boring to so many of us:  the way it’s taught.  For the most part, it is taught with textbooks and tests, requiring memorization of vocabulary and concepts that often seem to have no meaning or purpose for the student.  If science could be taught by actually letting the students DO science–e. g., work in a lab, or work on an actual field study–I think more of us would like it.  Experiments in class don’t quite cut it, though they help.  My .02.

I can do math as in algebra, alegebra II (not geometry, I hate shapes). But when you mix the idea of math with science I just can’t do it at all. mixing equations I have never done before with a bunch of complex big words with even more complex definitions just makes my brain shut down
Most of what you put on your list I have never heard anyone say. In fact what I hear people say about why they hate science is mostly the same thing I say:
1. science is not important to my major (I am planning to teach history, not science so I don’t like wasting money and time on classes I don’t actually need and will more than likely forget by the time second semester starts)
2. it is too textbook and lecture based. If science were more hands on from the time of elementary all the way through high school (and college if it must be taken at the college level) people wouldn’t hate it so much. also I hated it whenever teachers got to do the experiment but never let us get to do anything except watch it. it was always the suckiest “experiments” that no one wanted to do that was hands on in my h.s. chem class.
3. standardized testing just ruins whatever fun you could possibly learn from science. too many of my teachers teach from the test.
4. It just isn’t visual enough. Math and science need to be very visual and very example based but for some reason it is not.
Now I know science is important, but that is why there are people that choose to go into those careers. I just can’t stand that I have to pay and waste my time to take a class that I am not going to remember by the end of winter break (lets face it, none of us actually process and comprehend we just memorize long enough to meet the upcoming goal).

Science makes life so easy because of that it caused more painful things. it gives car and it gives carbondioxide gas. it gives light, electricity and it gives global warming. ha ha ha
it gives chemistry and it gives desease. it gives knowledgeble people rich and other people are poor.

Science was So hard for me to understand when I was young because I had a poor teacher so after I finally figured out how great science is I became a science teacher at vale middle school and it is the best thing that has ever happened to me!! If you love science and children become a science teacher. It’s amazing how many lives change because of teachers!!!!!!!

I hate science because no matter how much I try to work on it, I always don’t fully understand it or just do it all wrong.  And I never know what I’ve done wrong.
I hate it so much.

I appreciate science, I really do. I’m not even bad at it (undergrad in neuroscience), BUT I do have a problem with the way science is taught in schools. I find that there is very little inquiring done by students. Science becomes something machine like, not dynamic, not something that requires deep thinking. I’d say at least 60% of the kids I go to to uni with don’t have a clue what is happening, or can’t think for themselves, or can’t communicate their answers. Kids who do just great on multiple choice questions. All the while arts students are encouraged to think critically…and there is no such thing as all answers are right answers in the arts. I’d like to see more science students take up subjects like English, politics, philosophy, linguistics…instead of being restricted mainly to chemistry, physics, biology. See it too often

I think its because kids (like me) absolutely hate school with a passion, and think it’s a waste of time.

As far as evolution goes, I disagree with it. I don’t think there is concrete evidence to support such a claim. Nevertheless I am a biology major in college and have my ups and downs in terms of grades.

I love and I am good at art, poetry, literature, languages, history. But I deeply hate science and the way it is taught at school. And yes, most of the science teachers are very arrogant and contemptuous. My worst nightmare at school!

I don’t think anyone should be forced to like/dislike science. Although, they should be told to respect science’s verdict and science: vice versa. As for me…That’s none of your buisness. Other than that, everyone should just keep an open mind and take a chance with science, or whatever you presently struggle to accept/learn.

I like science, personally. It doesn’t just give a statement. it backs it up too.

The_Thinker, I’m mostly concerned that it’s important for people to know something about science and understand it at some level.  If they hate it, well, they’re going to be less likely to learn anything about it.

Everyone takes advantage of inventions brought about through discovery, but that doesn’t mean some of us can’t think science is empty and boring.  I like science, I hate the WORSHIP of science. Yet I feel forced to worship it, because of its results. I hate it.  I dread it.  It’s empty, and science can’t love me.

Todd, change your mind.  I see essentially no one “worshiping” science.  It’s just that most knowledge is based on science or opinion, and as someone with intellectual honesty, I prefer science.  Push that idea, without the need for worship.  Just because something works doesn’t mean people need to worship it.  Science is a passionless, impartial institute and does not care about worship.  STOP IT!

I don’t hate science. I fear science. Science is a logical way of explaining things, but it is scary how it says that humanity will stop existing. Science is supposed to be truth and sometimes the truth is harsh. I would like to think that the universe doesn’t exist so it never ends because it never started. Science always disproves itself and I would like to think that there is no definite answer, but school doesn’t teach that.

I hate science, but what I hate more is when people mix two things that have nothing to do with each other. It’s like when a liberal says to a conservative (in the USA)that ‘the entire country is founded on a liberal idea and that you have what you have because of liberals, so saying that you are a conservative goes against your country’–conservatives are the way they are because they believe certain ways on issues and belive that you deserve to keep the money that you earn instead of give it to lazy welfare receivers.
You say that science is technology, and though technology stems in some way from science, the inventors most likely did not even think about chemistry, biology, or physics when creating a cell phone, or a computer. When you think of it your way, you might as well say that everything has to do with science, but even though that is true, that isn’t what people mean by ‘hating science’. What most people hate is the math and the memorization part of it.
Personally, I am great at math, it’s my favorite subject in school. I used to get so confused when people responded to me–after I told them that I hate science–by saying that that doesn’t make sense because I like math. To me, they are completely different things. I don’t understand half of what is taught in science classes but understand math completely. Hey, maybe I’m just weird, but I think it has to do with subject, not how it is taught. For some reason, I just cannot stand it; I cannot remember any of the definitions or equations–and I tried, believe you me–and science still continues to kick my you-know-what to this day. I can’t seem to memorize any of it as if my mind filters out unimportant stuff and science some how gets mislabled.
If someone could explain this to, me I would  be grateful. I like the idea of being able to back things up with logical explanations, but the class–forget about it! I hate all of it.

I personally seem to agree with the whole thing that is written in “Five Reasons Why

I love science, science is great. How do you function without the science in the society? However I absolutely hate the arrogance of the irrational skeptics and people who use science to shield themselves to look bigger than they are. People who are closed minded who hides behind the veneer of science. They think their brain is of the highest order, and that the whole world is under their theories and egotistical talks. Science is but a progress towards finding the truth, but not the final truth itself, so quit being arrogant.

I don’t like science because it doesn’t interest me. I think physics is too reliant on math, I don’t like biology because it (I’ll be honest here) creeps me out, and I don’t like psychology because I don’t really like people and don’t want to know how they think. People are less shallow than the way you make them seem in here.

These aren’t accurate. I don’t like science because it’s boring, and most of the stuff that’s taught doesn’t help me with life in the future in anyway unless i WANTED to become a scientist. Why should I give a damn about a “golgi body”? What if I simply don’t care, and am not curious? What if I LIKE to not know so I can put it to my imagination? Also, scientists just arent fun people. This is why I think the creative, fun type do not like science

Why does Superman have a Muscular Body? Communicating Science:  Know your Audience! »

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, I've got some search results here on what causes anti-science attitudes. Let me try to make sense of this.

First, there's an article from Phys.org that talks about why people are skeptical of science. It mentions that some people have real concerns that need to be addressed, and that dismissing them as ignorant or stupid isn't helpful. It gives examples of three women with different reasons for being hesitant about vaccines: one because of a personal experience with allergies, another due to distrust in the medical system because of historical mistreatment of her community, and the third because she doesn't trust that the vaccines have been properly tested. The article suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing vaccine hesitancy isn't effective because people have diverse reasons for their skepticism.

Another article from Reason.com seems to be from 1973 and discusses what the author calls the "anti-science movement." It's interesting how even back then, there was concern about people opposing science and technology. The article talks about how the anti-science movement is attacking innovation at every stage, from research to production, and how it's often not explicit in its opposition but rather insidious in its approach. The author also mentions that some scientists themselves are joining the attack on science, which is concerning.

There's also a definition from Merriam-Webster for "anti-science," which is straightforward: it's a set of attitudes and beliefs that are opposed to or reject science and scientific methods and principles.

Then, there's an article from ScienceAlert that discusses research on why people reject science, and it concludes that it's not due to ignorance or lack of education. The researchers found that people who reject scientific consensus are often just as interested in science and well-educated as those who accept it. The issue is more about how people selectively choose facts that support their pre-existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias.

Lastly, there's a blog post from Mike Brotherton where he lists five reasons why people might think they hate science and suggests ways to address these issues. The reasons he outlines are:

1. Scientists are arrogant.

2. Science involves a lot of math, which some people are not good at.

3. Science is negative and skeptical.

4. Science contradicts people's beliefs.

5. Science is mechanistic and cold.

He then offers counterarguments for each of these points, trying to show that these perceptions aren't necessarily accurate or that there are ways to overcome them.

Okay, so synthesizing all this information, it seems that anti-science attitudes can arise from a variety of sources. Some people have legitimate concerns based on personal experiences or historical injustices, while others may reject science because it conflicts with their beliefs or because they feel that scientists are elitist. There's also the issue of confirmation bias, where people cherry-pick information that supports their views and disregard evidence that contradicts them.

It's clear that a blanket approach to promoting science isn't effective because different people have different motivations for their skepticism. Therefore, addressing anti-science attitudes requires understanding the specific concerns of different groups and tailoring responses accordingly.

For example, for someone who distrusts the medical system due to historical abuses, it's important to build trust through transparency and accountability. For someone who rejects climate science because it challenges their political beliefs, engaging with them on a level that respects their values and finding common ground might be more effective.

Moreover, the way science is communicated plays a crucial role. Using arrogant or condescending tones can alienate people and reinforce negative perceptions. Instead, approaching the conversation with empathy and openness can help bridge the gap.

In terms of the perception that science is cold and mechanistic, highlighting the human side of science—stories of scientists' struggles, passions, and the positive impacts of scientific discoveries—can make science more relatable and appealing.

Lastly, addressing the issue of confirmation bias requires educating people about critical thinking and the scientific method, so they can evaluate information more objectively.

In conclusion, anti-science attitudes are multifaceted and require nuanced approaches to address them effectively. It's essential to understand the root causes of skepticism and work towards building trust and fostering a greater appreciation for the value of science in our society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Anti-science attitudes arise from diverse sources including personal experiences, distrust in institutions, conflict with beliefs, and selective interpretation of facts. Effective strategies to counter these attitudes involve understanding individual concerns, building trust through transparency, respecting values, highlighting the human side of science, and promoting critical thinking.}} \]
