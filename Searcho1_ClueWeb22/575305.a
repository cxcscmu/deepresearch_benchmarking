I'm trying to understand why politics are so divided these days. It seems like everywhere you look, people are divided into different camps, and there's a lot of hostility between them. I think this is a really important issue, and I want to try to get to the bottom of it.

First, I need to define what I mean by "divided." I guess it means that there are distinct groups with differing opinions, and these groups don't agree on many issues. Often, they can't even have civil discussions about their differences. So, political division seems to be about polarization and a lack of common ground.

Now, why is this happening? There must be multiple factors at play here. Let me think about some possible reasons.

One thing that comes to mind is social media. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have algorithms that show users content that aligns with their existing beliefs. This creates echo chambers where people only hear viewpoints that reinforce their own, without exposure to opposing ideas. As a result, their beliefs become more extreme, and they may develop animosity towards those who hold different views.

Another factor could be the way news is reported nowadays. There are so many outlets, and many of them have clear political biases. People tend to choose sources that align with their political leanings, which again reinforces their beliefs and contributes to division.

Moreover, I think economic inequality plays a role. When there's a wide gap between the rich and the poor, it can lead to resentment and frustration among those who feel left behind. This can manifest in political polarization, with different groups advocating for different solutions to address economic disparities.

Also, cultural and identity issues seem to be driving division. In many societies, there are clashes between traditional values and more progressive ones. Issues like immigration, religion, and social norms can ignite strong emotions and divide people along ideological lines.

Furthermore, I believe that political leaders and parties often exploit these divisions for their own gain. By emphasizing differences and fostering an "us versus them" mentality, they can mobilize their base and gain political advantage. This can create a vicious cycle where division becomes self-perpetuating.

Let me try to organize these thoughts. It seems like there are several interrelated factors contributing to political division:

1. Social media algorithms creating echo chambers

2. Biased news outlets reinforcing partisan views

3. Economic inequality causing resentment and frustration

4. Cultural and identity issues sparking ideological conflicts

5. Politicians exploiting divisions for political gain

I need to consider whether these factors are universal or specific to certain countries. For example, is political division more pronounced in the United States compared to other democracies? If so, why?

Maybe I should look into some data or studies that have been conducted on this topic. Perhaps there are academics who have researched political polarization and can provide insights.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

Causes of Political Polarization
Introduction
The divergence of extreme political attitudes to various ideas and opinions brings about the term political polarization. Polarization increases opposition from different political parties with diverse views and opinions. Polarization itself can be democratizing, natural, or even amiable. Whichever form it takes, there are long term effects on the society as well as the state as large. Researchers recommend that only a few issues need to be addressed when it comes to political polarization, whereas others list a lot of issues that need to be addressed. Elite and mass polarization are the two levels that distinguish political polarization. The elite polarization mostly focuses on political party organizers and elected officials, while the mass polarization focuses on the general public. It is rare for days or months to pass without a series of stories concerning political polarization, especially in the United States. Will the causes of political polarization create a state division or togetherness in the near future? With all the research, it would be correct to say that political polarization will create a significant drift among the people.
Political polarization has been brought about by various reasons. The most causes for this being, ideological divisions between political parties and officeholders. This can, however, be reduced or completely done by using several ways, for example, changing the parliamentary system in the country. The various causes of polarization are discussed in depth below here.
Party polarization is one of the biggest causes of political polarization. The prevalence of diverging parties has been the primary cause of political polarization (Layman, Carsey, Horowitz, 2006). This theory has been based on the recent updates in the United States political parties. The majority party occupies the most positions that contain their political ideologies. For both, the elites and the public have various and different ideologies, thereby increasing different positions in the party. Political scientists continue to prove that politicians play a better part in the increase in polarization. For example, in early 1990, the ruling party at that time used polarized tricks for it to become the majority party. A research study proved that voters are often more polarized by leaders of a different party rather than those of their party. This makes it possible for leaders to take even more polarized stances.
Each time a political leader tries to use their polarized tricks to incite their voters against even their political party will bring splitting ideologies to persons. Wealthy people in society, co-corporations, and unions mostly form these political parties. Since they are highly influential in society, they are responsible for a mass donor for these political campaigns. Some political scientists claim that not all polarized single donors lead to a mass campaign that will drive the citizens into polarization.
The other leading cause of political polarization has been attributed to the end of the cold war. Initially, the cold war united Americans at a high rate. America, by then, had a lot of unions and did not divide for whatever reasons. There was no political polarization by then. The end of the cold war ushered in a new era of political polarization. Since Americans did not expect any more external threats or wars from outsiders, they had time to boil up the internal issues they had. There was no longer a global enemy to the country since their unity had helped conquer it all. The external threat was gone, and only the internal issues remained. These internal issues became the reason and rise to polarization. A division was created rather than creating unity among the people. This was the first step into the polarization that Americans took.
The geographical sorting is also another cause of political polarization. As it is, Americans live in civic-minded like communities. Its government governs each community. With such a setting, everyone will likely be talking of and thinking about politics. Their ideas and opinions will differ, thereby creating a rift. In a geographical place where the people are highly politically minded, a single leader can acquire a lot of votes from this separate area. For example, in 1976, a single leader would have gotten a total of 25 votes in an area full of politically minded people, while in 2016, that same leader will get a total vote of 60 in that same region (Barber, McCarty, 2015). Americans will disagree and agree to various matters pertaining to politics; however, when it comes to voting, they will have various opinions. They will vote regarding how they see the candidates and how well they are capable of helping them raise their living standards.
Earlier in the days, there was only liberal and democrats republicans. Today, these two have faced very high levels of sorting, and this has created a rift in these political parties. This gap has been said to increase from the initial 15% to 36%, which is a considerable margin. This goes hand in hand with the high diversity in religion, race, and ethics. America is less religious, and this has become a threat to the religious people living in America. The religious people in America tend to conserve their ideas and opinions to themselves without airing them out. This is incorporated similarly into political parties by issues such as abortion and LGBT rights, which are all based on religion. It would be hard for a religious person to vote for a leader who advocates for abortion for the sole reason that they feel is not right religiously. If people’s values and virtues differ, it will be hard for them to agree on anything since everyone has the right to sharing out their opinion. Racisms and ethnicity have also played a big part in political polarization. People of different races in America tend to join hands with people of their same color, which is also seen in the way they vote for their leaders as well as how they present themselves politically.
The united states judicial system has highly contributed to the increase in political polarization. For instance, in 2012, a confirmation rate for the presidential circuit court appointments was at 50% a rate lower than what was there in the 1980s. Today, it is capable of political parties to hinder nominees who want to be elected or even hinder themselves from any executive meetings or agendas (Yeliang, 2008). It is evident that high rates of on appeal courts, longer case processing as well as caseloads for judges have highly increased political polarization. The increased ideas and opinions from the judicial system have increasingly lead to a division in the legal system, which is then reflected in the political system at the party. Polarization can create strong partisan critiques when it comes to the judges, which will profoundly damage their public perceptions, opinions, and ideas of the justice system. Non-partisans in legal arbitration, for example, the common citizen, will doubt the legitimacy of these courts. This will cause an even bigger rift in the way the citizens see the judicial system, and of course, a judicial system will be useless without the political parties or leaders to come up with various directives for the courts.
Conclusion
There are a lot of causes that bring about political polarization. These causes bring about a politically dived nation. People should result in coming up with better measures on how to change the current state in society. They must focus on more critical issues facing society rather than political drifts and dispatches. One way in which the people can do this, for example, is by looking into what is causing the great division in the country and try to bring back the country in order. This would only be possible if people put their differences away and try to come up with one collective voice without caring for what race are they, the religion, nor even the political party. This will go a long way in fixing the various issues that affect citizens. Problems that have significantly been hidden by the colossal division the country is facing. A united nation will care for the needs of now, tomorrow, and the better future for everyone.

Political tension between the two big parties may be contributing to the decline of the US. What is the main cause of political polarization in America? Vote and invite others interested in security and US politics to join the debate
This debate is based on the LSE100 lecture “ Political Polarization and Declain in US "usable" power? ” (week 4 in the module: "Why is collective security so difficult to achieve?") by Professor Peter Trubowitz  (17 October 2016) at The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
Prof. Peter Trubowitz is the Director of the United States Cenre at the LSE. His research interest include American party politics and elections, US grand strategy and foreign policy, as well as Sino-American relations
Political polarization in America: Republicans vs Democrats
The already large, and growing gap between Republicans and Democrats has become a distinct characteristic of US politics. The tension between liberals and conservatives is not a new phenomenon and is to some extent the result of the majoritarian bipartisan US political system. However, several indicators show tha party polarization has been growing since the 1980s and that the ideological gap has widened more than ever over the last few years. Republicans are shifting to the right and Democrats to the Left.
Many political analysts argue that this increased polarization can be detrimental for the US, not only at the domestic, but also at the international level. Polarized politics may be contributing to the demise of the US hegemony in the world. Historically, moderate Republicans and Democrats have worked as a "bipartisan center", forging alliances and creating political dynamics of concessions and compromise. This was particularly important in the area of foreign policy and during the Second World War and Cold War. However, after the disintegration of the USSR the incentive to collaborate across party lines seem to have largely decreased. Unilateralism has become common and increased the risk of frustration and u-turns in politics.
If the US' ability to act on a coherent long-term foreign policy strategy is undermined by political polarization, then American attempts to enhance global security may be compromised. US interests in countering terrorist threats, establishing cyber security, and developing a coordinated response to global threats depend on the ability to work with long term strategic partners and enact policies which will not be susceptible to overhaul after each electoral cycle. Deadlock between the arms of government can also inhibit the US' ability to act decisively and to succeed in tackling global threats where new approaches are needed. Is inconsistent behaviour at the international level an inevitable consequence of increasingly partisan politics?
Causes of political polarization
Several potential causes have been suggested for this phenomenon. Firstly, as mentioned above, the absence of a strong external threat can reduce the incentive to collaborate across party boundaries. If this is the case probably the rise of China may have the reverse effect in US party politics in the coming years. After the Crimea, East Ukraine and Syria Crises Russia is once more emerging as an external threat for the West. However, there are no signs that Vladimir Putin's foreign policy has made Democrats and Republicans unite on a common stance towards foreign policy yet.
Secondly, it has been argued that polarization was fuelled by the assertive unilateralism of the Bush Jr. administration. According to this argument, a small group of neo-conservatives, with the help of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, managed to drastically change US policy agenda, in particular their foreign policy. This departure from the "usual practices" may have triggered much frustration in the liberal camp and set into motion the current dynamics of confrontation and ideological polarization. The dire 2016 Presidential Elections campaign between Trump and Clinton has contributed to fuel these tensions.
Thirdly, structural changes in US society have also been suggested as a plausible explanation. There seems to be a strong correlation between income inequality (as measured by the Gini index) and party polarization. This argument suggests that the growing socio-economic gap between the richest and poorest in US society may also be reflected in the actions of political representatives. Moreover, the return of regional divides that the US is experiencing today makes it more difficult to sustain a centrist coalition.
Emerging questions: What do you think is the main cause for the growing political polarization in America? Is polarization that dangerous for international collective security? Who is going to play the role the US has been playing in the international arena over the last few decades?

Who is the cause of society’s polarization? All of us.
Matt Malone, S.J. April 20, 2018
James Cartmill, of Veterans for Peace, holds an American flag upside down, to indicate distress during a Nov. 24 demonstration in Oakland, Calif., following a decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a white Ferguson police officer in the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb.

I am writing this from Saint Louis University, where I am taking part in a lecture series celebrating the 200th anniversary of this great institution. My topic is Pope Francis, U.S. politics and polarization, a subject I am often called upon to discuss. I think in five years I have taken part in at least a dozen panels, all of which were asking, “What are the causes of polarization?”
Yet in contemporary politics, the question is not “What is the cause of polarization?” The question is “Who is the cause of polarization?” And the answer is: You are. You are the cause of polarization. And I am. Together, we are the causes of polarization. Unless we are willing to admit that, then the situation will only get worse. For polarization is not something that is happening to us but something we are causing. And the temptation to think that you or I are not complicit in it and that the fault lies entirely with someone else is actually what polarization is.
Together, we are the causes of polarization. Unless we are willing to admit that, then the situation will only get worse.
After all, what does polarization require? Two poles. By that I do not mean two people or groups of people who disagree with each other. That is actually what democracy requires. What polarization requires is two people or two groups of people who disagree, each of whom believes that the other is entirely at fault and is politically, philosophically and perhaps even morally irredeemable. This is the fault line of our contemporary politics, the result of our choices.
How many of us have stopped reading opinions with which we disagree? How many of us have stopped watching news channels that feature opinions with which we disagree? How many of us complain about the content in our social media feeds while somehow forgetting that we actually chose to follow every one of those people? How many of us, deep down in places we don’t like to talk about, take some pleasure in the adrenaline rush that comes from clicking “like” and thereby instantly creating an us and a them?
The 2016 presidential election was one of the closest in U.S. history. It was weeks, in fact, before we learned the final tallies. It was that close. Yet consider this: 65 percent of Americans live in a congressional district that favored either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton by 20 points or more. We do not even live near people with whom we disagree. That is the result of our choices, yours and mine, and those of our elected representatives.
65 percent of Americans live in a congressional district that favored either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton by 20 points or more. We do not even live near people with whom we disagree.
Pope Francis sees this clearly for what it is. The phenomena involved in polarization reflect a deeper spiritual crisis in modernity, within you and within me. That is why this is the most important thing that Pope Francis has ever said about politics: “I am a sinner.” The first question he was asked in his very first interview, which we published in America, was “Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio?” To which the pope replied: “I am a sinner.” I suggest that this is where we should start the reform of our politics, by recognizing our individual complicity in the sin of polarization, by what we have done and by what we have failed to do, and by asking for the grace to change.
I appreciate that this may not be what we want to hear. But this is our best hope. As long as you believe that the problem is someone else, then there is nothing you can do about it, and you will continue to feel helpless and at the mercy of forces beyond your control. But if we are all able to acknowledge how we are a part of the problem, then we can begin to imagine how we might be part of the solution.
We can begin the conversation by focusing on what we all have in common rather on our differences, a move that is itself subversive of polarization.
What is the issue at its heart? Pope Francis told us when he addressed the U.S. Congress: “The contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization…. We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”
“The enemy within” is nothing more than our age-old nemesis: fear. We are afraid. All of us. And that’s good news too, because it means that we all have something else in common and an additional means of relating anew to each other, by the grace of God. To do that we simply need to do what God, through the risen Christ, is always urging us to do anyway: “Be not afraid.”

What is the effect of constituent polarization in government?
Asked by: Zhenzhen Luferov
asked in category: General Last Updated: 9th March, 2020
What is the effect of constituent polarization in government?
It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government ., and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil, which can alienate voters.

In this regard,  what does polarization in politics mean quizlet?
Political Polarization. Occurs when two sides are deeply divided and far apart on policy preferences. In addition, polarized voters believe that oppositional victory is a disaster for the country.
Also Know,  what happened to the two major parties in the 1960s and 1970s? In the 1960s and 70s, the New Deal coalition fell apart. This was due to the Civil Rights Movement, Roe v. After the 1964 Civil Rights Act, many white, conservative Southern Democrats became Republicans. The South had been mostly Democratic before 1964; it was mostly Republican after.
Also,  what is polarization in society?
Social polarization is associated with the segregation within a society that may emerge from income inequality, real-estate fluctuations, economic displacements etc. and result in such differentiation that would consist of various social groups, from high-income to low-income.
What is political compromise?
To compromise is to make a deal between different parties where each party gives up part of their demand. The problem of political compromise in general is an important subject in political ethics.

The Top 14 Causes of Political Polarization
David Blankenhorn
Why we can’t stand each other, explained.
W hy do Americans increasingly believe that those in the other party are not only misguided, but are also bad people whose views are so dangerously wrong-headed and crazy as to be all but incomprehensible? What has created what Arthur Brooks in his forthcoming book calls a “culture of contempt” in American politics and public life?
I’m glad you asked! Behold a bakers-dozen worth of causes.
1. The end of the Cold War. The West’s victory in the Cold War means that (with the possible exception of jihadi terrorism) there is no longer a global enemy to keep us united as we focus on a powerful and cohesive external threat.
2. The rise of identity-group politics. On both the Left and the Right, the main conceptual frameworks have largely shifted in focus from unifying values to group identities. As Amy Chua puts it in Political Tribes (2018): “The Left believes that right-wing tribalism—bigotry, racism—is tearing the country apart. The Right believes that left-wing tribalism—identity politics, political correctness—is tearing the country apart. They are both right.” (Never mind here the possibly problematic usage of the terms “tribe” and “ tribal .”)
3. Growing religious diversity. Current trends in American religion reflect as well as contribute to political polarization. One trend is growing secularization, including a declining share of Americans who are Christians, less public confidence in organized religion, and rising numbers of religiously unaffiliated Americans. One consequence is an increasingly open contestation of Christianity’s once-dominant role in American public and political culture. But another trend is the continuing, and in some respects intensifying, robustness of religious faith and practice in many parts of the society. This growing religious divide helps to explain the rise of several of the most polarizing social issues in our politics, such as gay marriage and abortion. It also contributes to polarizing the two political parties overall, as religious belief becomes an increasingly important predictor of party affiliation. For example, among Democrats and Democratic-leaning U.S. adults, religiously unaffiliated voters (the “nones”) are now more numerous than Catholics, evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, or members of historically black Protestant traditions, whereas socially and theologically conservative Christians today are overwhelmingly Republican.
4. Growing racial and ethnic diversity. In the long run, increased racial and ethnic diversity is likely a strength. But in the short run—which means now—it contributes to a decline in social trust (the belief that we can understand and count on one another) and a rise in social and political conflict.
5. The passing of the Greatest Generation. We don’t call them the greatest for no reason. Their generational values, forged in the trials of the Great Depression and World War II—including a willingness to sacrifice for country, concern for the general welfare, a mature character structure, and adherence to a shared civic faith—reduced social and political polarization. Thus, note:
I didn’t vote for him but he’s my President, and I hope he does a good job.
—John Wayne (b. 1907) on the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960
I hope he fails.
—Rush Limbaugh (b. 1951) on the election of Barack Obama in 2008
6. Geographical sorting. Americans today are increasingly living in politically like-minded communities. Living only or mainly with like-minded neighbors makes us both more extreme and more certain in our political beliefs. As Bill Bishop and Robert Cushing put it in The Big Sort (2008): “Mixed company moderates; like-minded company polarizes. Heterogeneous communities restrain group excesses; homogeneous communities march toward the extremes.”
Percent of U.S. voters living in counties in which a presidential candidate won by a “landslide” margin of 20 percent or more of the vote:
1976: 25
2016: 60
7. Political party sorting. Once upon a time, there were such creatures as liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. No longer. The parties have sorted philosophically such that today almost all liberals are Democrats and all conservatives are Republicans. One main result is that the partisan gap between the parties is wide and getting wider.
Across 10 measures that Pew Research Center has tracked on the same surveys since 1994, the average partisan gap has increased from 15 percentage points to 36 points.
—Pew Research Center, 2017
8. New rules for Congress. The weakening and in some cases elimination of “regular order”—defined broadly as the rules, customs, and precedents intended to promote orderly and deliberative policymaking—as well as the erosion of traditions such as Senatorial courtesy and social fraternization across party lines—have contributed dramatically to less trust and more animosity in the Congress, thus increasing polarization.
It’s hard to exaggerate how much House Republicans and Democrats dislike each other these days.
—Juliet Eilperin, Fight Club Politics (2006)
9. New rules for political parties. Many reforms in how we nominate, elect, and guide our political leaders—shifting the power of nomination from delegates to primaries, dismantling political machines, replacing closed-door politics with televised politics, and shrinking the influence of career politicians—aimed to democratize the system. But these changes also replaced the “middle men” who helped keep the system together with a political free-for-all in which the loudest and most extreme voices are heard above all others.
As these intermediaries’ influence fades, politicians, activists, and voters all become more individualistic and unaccountable. The system atomizes. Chaos becomes the new normal both in campaigns and in the government itself.
—Jonathan Rauch, “How American Politics Went Insane,” 2016
10. New political donors. In earlier eras, money in American politics tended to focus on candidates and parties, while money from today’s super-rich donors tends to focus on ideas and ideology—a shift that also tends to advance polarization.
11. New political districts . Widespread gerrymandering—defined as manipulating district boundaries for political advantage—contributes significantly to polarization, most obviously by making candidates in gerrymandered districts worry more about being “primaried” by a more extreme member of their own party than about losing the general election.
12. The spread of media ghettoes. The main features of the old analog media—including editing, fact-checking, professionalization, and the privileging of institutions over individuals—served as a credentialing system for American political expression. The distinguishing feature of the new digital media—the fact that anyone can publish anything that gains views and clicks—is replacing that old system with a non-system that is atomized and largely leaderless. One result made possible by this change is that Americans can now live in media ghettoes. If I wish, I can live all day every day encountering in my media travels only those views with which I already agree. Living in a media ghetto means less that my views are shaped and improved, much less challenged, than that they are hardened and made more extreme; what might’ve been analysis weakens into partisan talking points dispensed by identity-group leaders; moreover, because I’m exposed only to the most cartoonish, exaggerated versions of my opponents’ views, I come to believe that those views are so unhinged and irrational as to be dangerous. More broadly, the new media resemble and reinforce the new politics, such that the most reliable way to succeed in either domain is to be the most noisesome, outrageous, and polarizing.
13. The decline of journalistic responsibility. The dismantling of the old media has been accompanied by, and has probably helped cause, a decline in journalistic standards. These losses to society include journalists who’ll accept poor quality in pursuit of volume and repetition as well as the blurring and even erasure of boundaries between news and opinion, facts and non-facts, and journalism and entertainment. These losses feed polarization.
W hat have we learned so far from this survey of polarization causes?  I’d say, four things. I’d also say, not enough to get to the heart of the matter.
For starters, we could probably make the list longer. For example, we could plausibly argue that rising income equality should be added (though in my view the evidence on this one is ambiguous). Second, we can see that some of these causes are ones we either can’t do much about or wouldn’t want to even if we could. Third, few if any of these causes contain the quality of intentionality: None of them wake up each morning and say, “Let’s polarize!” Even those coming closest to reflecting the intention to polarize, such as gerrymandering, reflect other and more fundamental intentions, such as winning elections, advancing a political agenda, or gaining clicks or viewers.
The fourth conclusion is the most important. None of these 13 causes directly perpetuate polarization. They are likely what analysts would call distal (ultimate) causes, but they are not proximate (immediate, direct) causes. They seem to have shaped an environment that incentivizes polarization, but they are not themselves the human words and deeds that polarize.
And so our bakers-dozen list ultimately doesn’t satisfy. We need a 14 th cause, arguably the most important one. It’s certainly the most direct and immediate, the most proximate, cause of polarization.
14. The growing influence of certain ways of thinking about each other. These polarizing habits of mind and heart include:
Favoring binary (either/or) thinking.
Absolutizing one’s preferred values.
Viewing uncertainty as a mark of weakness or sin.
Indulging in motivated reasoning (always and only looking for evidence that supports your side).
Relying on deductive logic (believing that general premises justify specific conclusions).
Assuming that one’s opponents are motivated by bad faith.
Permitting the desire for approval from an in-group (“my side”) to guide one’s thinking.
Succumbing intellectually and spiritually to the desire to dominate others (what Saint Augustine called libido dominandi ).
Declining for oppositional reasons to agree on basic facts and on the meaning of evidence.
These ways of thinking constitute the actual precipitation of polarization—the direct and immediate causes of holding exaggerated and stereotyped views of each other, treating our political opponent as enemies, exhibiting growing rancor and aggression in public life, and acting as if common ground does not exist.
What’s the lesson here? Although we didn’t think our way into polarization—larger and more distal forces shaped the prospects for it—we’ll need largely to think our way out. At this point in the process, unless some cataclysmic social change (economic collapse, another world war) does it for us, the first thing to change to get out of this mess is our minds.
One final consideration. It would be nice to make a straightforward “us versus them” enemies list when it comes to who’s to blame for polarization. But the fact is, none of us is pure—besides which the impulse to create an enemies list is part of the problem, not part of the solution. Some of us are more inclined to polarizing habits than others; some of us when we foster polarization are more aware of what we’re doing than others; and some of us (more and more of us, it seems) make a pretty good living these days out of encouraging and participating in polarization. But the habits and temptations of polarization are always with all of us. That includes you and me, by the way. The fault, dear reader, is not just in our 13 stars, but also in ourselves.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First up, there's a document from Sharksavewriters.com about causes of political polarization. It mentions several points, like ideological divisions between political parties, the end of the Cold War, geographical sorting, and the role of the judicial system. It seems like it's focusing mainly on the United States, which might be a bit narrow for a general understanding of political division, but it's still useful.

Next, there's a debate from Netivist.org about whether political polarization in America is mainly due to structural changes in society. It talks about how polarization might be harming US hegemony and its ability to act coherently in foreign policy. It also mentions that after the end of the Cold War, the incentive to collaborate across party lines decreased, leading to more unilateralism and inconsistency in international actions.

Then, there's an article from America Magazine by Matt Malone, S.J., who argues that polarization is caused by all of us, not just some external force. He points out that we choose to live in like-minded communities, follow only those who agree with us on social media, and enjoy the rush of agreeing with our own side. He emphasizes personal responsibility and the need for admitting our own complicity in polarization.

Another source is Askinglot.com, which provides a straightforward answer that constituent polarization leads to confrontational dynamics between parties, lowers public trust in government, and makes political debates seem uncivil, which can alienate voters.

There's also a quizlet entry defining political polarization as a situation where two sides are deeply divided and far apart in their policy preferences, and where voters believe that the opposing side's victory would be disastrous for the country.

Moving on, there's a reference to changes in the two major US parties in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly due to the Civil Rights Movement and shifts in party affiliations in the South.

Social polarization is described as segregation within society arising from income inequality, real-estate issues, and economic displacements, leading to different social groups from high to low income.

Lastly, there's an explanation of political compromise as a deal where each party gives up part of their demands, which is important in political ethics.

But the most comprehensive list comes from The American Interest article titled "The Top 14 Causes of Political Polarization" by David Blankenhorn. He lists 14 causes, starting from the end of the Cold War, the rise of identity-group politics, growing religious and racial diversity, the passing of the Greatest Generation, geographical sorting, political party sorting, new rules for Congress and political parties, new political donors, new political districts (gerrymandering), the spread of media ghettos, the decline of journalistic responsibility, and finally, the influence of certain ways of thinking about each other that foster polarization.

Blankenhorn concludes that while many external factors have contributed to polarization, the most direct cause is the way we think about and treat each other, and that to overcome polarization, we need to change our minds and behaviors.

Reflecting on all these sources, it seems that political polarization is a complex phenomenon with multiple interrelated causes. External factors like the end of the Cold War, changes in media, and societal shifts certainly play a role, but personal attitudes and behaviors are also crucial. The idea that polarization is something we all contribute to, rather than just being imposed on us, is a recurring theme.

I think the key takeaway is that addressing polarization requires both structural changes and individual introspection and action. We need to look at how our societies are organized, how our political systems function, and how media influences us, but we also need to examine our own biases and habits, and be willing to engage with differing viewpoints in a respectful manner.

So, to answer the question "Why are politics so divided?" It's due to a combination of historical, social, political, and technological factors, as well as our own tendencies towards tribalism and confirmation bias. Overcoming this division will require concerted effort from all aspects of society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Politics are divided due to a combination of historical, social, political, and technological factors, as well as individual tendencies towards tribalism and confirmation bias.}} \]
