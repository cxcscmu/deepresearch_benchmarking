I've been wondering why some people who are exposed to COVID don't end up getting sick. It seems like not everyone who comes into contact with the virus actually contracts it. There must be some reasons behind this. Let me try to figure this out.

First, I need to understand how COVID spreads. I know that it's primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. So, if someone is near an infected person, they might inhale these droplets containing the virus. That's one way exposure happens.

But not everyone who is exposed gets infected. There must be factors that influence whether the virus takes hold in a person's body or not. Maybe it has something to do with the virus itself, or perhaps it's about the person's immune system, or maybe even the environment they're in.

Let me consider the virus first. Perhaps some exposures involve a low amount of viral particles, which might not be enough to cause infection. I've heard terms like "viral load" – maybe if the exposure leads to a small viral load, the body can fight it off before it takes hold. So, the quantity of the virus exposed to could be a factor.

Also, the virus needs to find a way into the body. Main entry points are the mouth, nose, and eyes. If someone is exposed but manages to avoid touching their face or takes precautions like wearing a mask, that could reduce the chance of infection. So, personal habits and protective measures play a role.

Now, considering the person's immune system. Some people have stronger immune systems than others. Factors like age, general health, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle choices can affect immune strength. Younger, healthier individuals might be better equipped to fight off the virus. Also, people who have been vaccinated or have had previous infections might have some immunity against certain variants.

Genetics could also play a part. There might be genetic variations that make some people more resistant to infection. I recall hearing about studies suggesting that certain gene types affect susceptibility to viruses.

Moreover, the specific strain or variant of the virus could influence infectivity. Some variants might be more contagious than others, but even so, not everyone exposed to these variants gets infected.

Environmental factors could also be at play. For example, indoor spaces with poor ventilation might increase the risk of infection compared to outdoor areas where air circulation disperses viral particles. So, the setting in which exposure occurs could affect the likelihood of infection.

Let me think about the stages of infection. For an infection to occur, the virus needs to enter the body, attach to cells, replicate, and spread. If any of these steps are blocked, infection might not happen. Maybe some people's bodies are able to stop the virus at one of these stages.

Perhaps the body recognizes the virus and mounts an immune response before the virus can establish itself. Things like antibodies from previous infections or vaccinations could neutralize the virus before it causes illness.

I should also consider the concept of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infections. Some people might get infected but show no symptoms, so from an outsider's perspective, it seems like they didn't get COVID, when in fact, they did but didn't experience illness.

Wait, that complicates things. So, maybe some people do get infected but don't show symptoms, while others don't get infected at all. There's a difference there that I need to distinguish.

Maybe I need to look into studies or research that has been done on this topic. Perhaps there are statistics or scientific findings that can shed more light on why some exposed individuals don't get COVID.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

Covid-19

The Covid pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives (Picture: PA)
The Covid pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives over the past couple of years – with lockdowns, self-isolation and vaccines becoming all too familiar, not to mention the possibility of actually getting the virus.
So far there have been over 11 million confirmed cases of Covid in the UK and around 147,000 deaths – with infections rising more steeply than ever in the wake of the new Omicron variant.
While millions across the world have now had a brush with Covid – with others having built up their immunity through the vaccines – there are still people who have never tested positive for the virus, with some new research suggesting that certain people may be more resistant to infection than others.
Just why do some people not get Covid – even if they are exposed to the virus?
Why do some people not get Covid?
First things first – as it stands, there is no official reason why some people might prove resistant to a Covid infection, even if they do end up being exposed to the virus through a close contact.
However, new research conducted recently by UCL might have shed some light on the matter.
They have suggested some people’s avoidance of Covid could be to do with the reaction from their T-cells – the white blood cells in our bodies which help us fight infections – and from previous exposure to other coronaviruses such as the common cold.
T-cells could be your saviour (Picture: Getty Images)
The research, which was published in the journal Nature in November, suggests that ‘memory T-Cells’ – which may have been generated in some people when fighting colds and the like – may be triggered when the Covid virus enters the body.
This leads to them ‘cleaning up’ the virus and clearing it from the body before it has the chance to start causing any damage.
This in turn means it does not stay in the system long enough to cause any symptoms or create antibodies – leading to a negative result on PCR or lateral flow tests.
‘Everyone has anecdotal evidence of people being exposed but not succumbing to infection,’ explained Leo Swadling, an immunologist at University College London and the lead author of the paper.
Anyone can still get Covid regardless of their immunity levels (Picture: Getty Images)
‘What we didn’t know is whether these individuals really did manage to completely avoid the virus or whether they naturally cleared the virus before it was detectable by routine tests.’
The study was carried out on 731 healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic – and the results showed that 58 of them did not test positive for Covid despite being in a high-risk setting.
However the research did show those people experienced a spike in T-cell activity, suggesting they may already have had ‘memory T-cells’ which cleared a Covid infection from their body.
It’s thought the research could be used to make new vaccines which target the T-cell instead of antibody response – which could potentially give longer-lasting protection.
Does this mean I won’t get Covid?
Getting your booster jab still provides some of the highest levels of protection (Picture: PA)
While all of this is promising news, it’s worth noting that whatever level of immunity you may have against Covid – even if you do fall into the above category of having never been infected despite exposure – that doesn’t mean you won’t get it at some point.
For one thing there is no way of knowing who might have the T-Cell reaction which could keep them safe from infection – it might be that you have just been lucky up to this point.
Some people may also have had the virus asymptomatically and not realised, while others may have mistaken it for another illness such as a cold or flu.
And of course other factors do come into play when it comes to avoiding a Covid infection, such as wearing face masks in indoor spaces, limiting your social contacts and regular handwashing – as well as making sure you are up to date with your vaccines and boosters.

A UKHSA spokesperson told metro.co.uk: ‘We welcome and continuously monitor studies of this type, that help us better understand how Covid-19 affects the immune system and can inform the development of vaccines and other treatments.
‘While the virus continues to spread rapidly, it’s important that we all do everything possible to protect ourselves and others.
‘The best way to do this is to come forwards for your first two doses of vaccine, or your booster jab, limiting contact with others where possible, washing hands regularly, wearing a face covering in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, and working from home if you can.’
Of course, if you do develop symptoms which could be Covid, you should always get a PCR test and self-isolate until you know the result.
The official symptoms according to the NHS are a new continous cough, a temperature and loss of taste and/or smell – although symptoms of the Omicron variant are reported to include a dry, scratchy throat, night sweats, mild muscle aches and fatigue.

Why do some people just not get covid?
Question
A friend of mine went away over New Years with 25 people, of which 23 have tested positive, and then went to field day on New Year’s Day (a music festival) with a group of 8 people, all of whom except him have tested positive. Is he just lucky or are some people just immune to covid?

I wonder if there’s a chance they already had it and it was mild so they didn’t notice.
Also, I have no idea but that’s some good odds.

That’s the theory I’m going on. I should have gotten it, I’ve been around people that have got it and somehow I’ve managed to dodge it.
Either I’ve got it so mildly it’s not showing up on tests, or I’ve already had it at some point and not had severe enough symptoms to call in sick and get a PCR test (which would not come back for days being in a regional area).

This is common.  I’ve known many people who escaped covid despite repeated exposure, including a spouse or child with a case.  Who knows.
I’ll also add that someone who is asymptomatic doesn’t really have covid in the traditional sense.  In the before times, you’d never say you’re asymptomatic for the chicken pox or the flu.  Being sick meant you had symptoms of an illness.  A large number of people test positive for covid but don’t ever end up sick.

Not really a proper answer to your question, but my wife seems to get colds & similar illnesses quite regularly. I, on the other hand, almost never get sick other than maybe a handful of manflu bouts in the last 10-15 years. I don't know why but I am guessing it has something to do with genetics and maybe something to do with diet, vitamin D levels, and overall health & fitness. She is also vegan and I suspect probably is not getting all the nutrients that she needs (not saying vegan diets are inherently bad, just that it requires a lot more effort to get in all the right stuff and she doesn't really do that)

Not everyone gets everything going around, yes, good genes can protect us as well. Many people nursed Spanish Flu patients both at home and in hospital and didn’t catch it. Some people never have flu or a cold and yet some seem to pick up every bug going. Depends on your own immune system and now we know more about viral loads!
When I worked in an office I very rarely got a cold, yet everyone else would be going down like flies. Bit of a pain as I had to go everyone else’s work!
They are doing some studies with front line workers who have never had it, they’ve done all the antibody tests and have yet to find any trace of infection. I know some people will catch it because of defective T-cell genes, they discovered that after 4 seemingly healthy young guys ended up in ICU in The Netherlands and they started to investigate why.

Question
How accurate have you found RAT tests?
I was feeling unwell earlier in the week, took a RAT test and it was negative. Started feeling worse Friday night and another RAT test came back negative.
In the early hours of Saturday morning it was pretty obvious that I must have covid. A PCR test has now confirmed this.
How accurate are these tests? At which day of infection is it likely to show up positive for you?
I'm asking this because 2-3 of my co-workers have felt slightly unwell at work this week, and all returned multiple negative RAT tests.

Question
Had Anyone Received the $250 "Cost of Living" Payment, Yet?
I've been doing some Googling and can't find any info on when exactly the payments should start being sent out. Everything just says "April", but we're past halfway through the month and no one I know irl has received it. I'm a disability pensioner and the impact of COVID-19 on cost of living is hitting my household super hard, and the lack of information on when we should expect that $250 is just another source of financial stress, tbh.
It may be a pathetic attempt at buying votes for the lowest price possible that won't actually do ANYTHING to relieve the ongoing financial pressure the pandemic has us all under rn, but it's still $250, y'know? Like I'd rather the government work out a plan to combat the actual problem longterm, but it's the Coalition, so I think we all know that isn't going to happen.

A lot of comments on this sub saying that Omicron was a good thing. Curious why people think this when: Firstly, we know boosters were highly effective in suppressing Delta to R < 1.0 (images 1 & 2 & 3). Secondly, Omicron infection does not seem to provide good neutralizing immunity (image 4).

Are Some People Already Immune to COVID-19 Without Getting It or Receiving the Vaccine?
There are several factors that give some people resistance or even immunity to COVID-19 even though they’ve never had the virus or received the vaccine.
Credit: Mustsharenews.com
Now that many people have been fully vaccinated for months, there is discussion about just how long this will protect us from getting the virus, or at least getting deathly ill from it. Additional doses being offered to some 28 days after their second dose of a mRNA vaccine, and booster shots offered to others eight months after receiving the second dose of a mRNG vaccine are creating concern about how long the protection lasts.
There is also a great deal of interest in individuals who have some resistance to the virus or are actually immune to it. Medical researchers already recognized within months of the onset of the pandemic that there were certain people who were heavily exposed to COVID-19 but didn’t contract it. For example, health care providers working on the front lines with people who have the virus and are contagious or people who live with and care for a number of family members all of whom are ill with the virus but the individual is not.
In one study conducted in Ecuador, it was shown that 80 percent of participants recovering from the virus and 44 percent of unexposed participants had a strong COVID-19 virus-specific T-cell response. Researchers hypothesized that the high rate of T-cell response in unexposed subjects was likely due to previous exposure to coronaviruses associated with the common cold or other viral or microbial antigens. In the studies conducted examining T-cell response in individuals never exposed to COVID-19, the positive immune response rates ranged from 28 percent to 50 percent.
According to Russian scientist Areg Totolyan, head of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute, there are several reasons why some people are much less susceptible to contracting COVID-19 than most. His research has shown that there are three factors which contribute to decreases susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus.
First, people with elevated levels of interferon alpha neutralizes the viral particles that have yet to enter the cells. Second, a high concentration of lymphocytes in the blood which are the primary cells of the immune system helps fight off the viral cells recognizing them as foreign. Third, those who carry specific genetic markers found among the genes that are responsible for encoding the immune response in humans have increased protection against COVID-19.
According to Totolyan, there are a number of other factors that could contribute to immunity or lower susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus but he stated that research on them has just started.

Why do some people keep getting Covid while others NEVER fall ill?
06/01/2022
WE all know at least one person who seems to be especially good at dodging Covid.
There seems to be people who, despite being in very close contact with positive people, just don't pick up the bug – while others catch every new variant.
Some people seem to avoid catching Covid altogether while others have managed to be reinfected Credit: AFP
For those who have caught the variant, a string of hugely positive studies show Omicron is milder than other strains.
Covid booster jabs protect against Omicron and offer the best chance to get through the pandemic, health officials have repeatedly said.
The Sun's Jabs Army campaign is helping get the vital extra vaccines in Brits' arms to ward off the need for any new restrictions.
At the moment, as the majority of Brits have been blighted with Omicron in recent weeks, many will be asking pals who have never isolated: “How have you escaped it again?”
Could it be to do with luck, winning the vaccine protection lottery or down to genes…
Top immunologists think there could be a reason behind it – with some lucky people having a natural built in immunity.
Experts in Britain and Brazil are investigating if some humans already had a body that was prepped to fight the virus, before the pandemic began.
Their blood and cells could help scientists understand more about immunity, and may even point the way to Covid vaccine that could beat any variant.
For those that keep catching Covid, it doesn't necessarily mean their immune system isn't working as well.
Despite being vaccinated, they may be simply more prone to viruses, their immunity has waned, they are less careful with handwashing/mask wearing etc or just unlucky in managing to tick off each variant.
Danny Altmann, professor of medicine and immunology at Imperial College London, told the Telegraph immunity genes differ hugely from person to person.
He said: “I’m talking about thousands of possibilities on your chequerboard; no two people will ever look the same.”
Current research at Oxford University and Imperial College London are testing how easily some people catch Covid compared to others.
Volunteers, who have had the same vaccine doses, are being exposed to the same virus and then kept in isolation for two weeks.
It's expected that the immune responses will be different for each person.
NATURAL IMMUNITY?
A similar study happened at the start of the pandemic, where healthcare based staff were likely to be exposed to Covid at work.
But at the end of the trial only 20 per cent had clear signs of a Covid infection, while 65 per cent had not been infected at all.
The remaining 15 per cent had experienced low-level “abortive infections”, which weren't picked up on PCR tests.
They had no Covid antibodies, but had a higher than average T-cell count – suggesting their bodies had seen off the virus before it bedded in.
It was as if their bodies were already able to battle Covid, despite not having come across the virus before.
Mala Maini, a professor of viral immunology at University College London, and co-author of the study, said: “They didn’t completely resist the infection, but they eliminated it so rapidly that it couldn’t be picked up by the standard test.”
In 2020 a top scientists said a “significant number” of Brits are naturally immune to Covid.
Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said it's likely a large amount of the population already had a “background level” of protection against Covid-19.
He said: “I think they are present in quite a significant number of people.
“So there is probably background T-cell immunity in people before they see the coronavirus, and that may be relevant that many people get a pretty asymptomatic disease.
“Those T-cells get a bit tired once you're beyond the age of 65 and may not be as effective at removing a virus, so that may explain a number of different features of the disease.”
It comes as the PM today lashed out at the “tragedy” of “mumbo jumbo” anti-vaxxers spouting “nonsense” online – as he warned the NHS is under “huge” pressure.
The PM insisted ministers were doing everything possible to make sure that the people most likely to get ill are getting vaccinated, as he again urged everyone to come forward and get jabbed now.
He stressed Britain would “get through this wave” but warned “the pressure on hospital is clear – we've got to give the health service all the help we can through the next period”.
Thanks to the booster rollout, Boris Johnson said the country will be in a stronger position to fight Omicron when Plan B measures expire in three weeks.

TORONTO -- 
	One of the most perplexing parts of the coronavirus pandemic has been the fact that some people become seriously sick with the virus while their closest loved ones remain healthy and, in some cases, test negative.
It was announced on March 25 that Prince Charles tested positive for COVID-19 while his wife, Camilla, tested negative. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed no symptoms of the virus despite Sophie Gregoire Trudeau suffering from a fever and other uncomfortable symptoms.
The question of why some people fall ill and others don’t is one that researchers are working to answer. But one of the likeliest factors is the health of our individual immune systems.
“So you might have a stronger immune system that makes you less susceptible to becoming infected or that makes you more resistant to the infection,” Dr. Eleanor Fish, an immunology professor at the University of Toronto, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Wednesday.

Everyone’s immune system reacts differently when exposed to a virus. Someone with a strong, healthy immune system who is exposed to a virus may not become infected, or may become infected but show few symptoms. Those with compromised immune systems and the elderly are considered at higher risk of dying from COVID-19.
Some doctors have suggested that Trudeau may already have the coronavirus but has no symptoms. Trudeau has not been tested for the virus, as most doctors recommend against testing people who are asymptomatic.
In Camilla’s case, Dr. Fish said it’s possible that proper hygiene could’ve played a role in her negative test results. However, she added that it’s entirely possible that Camilla could test positive later.
“There are many examples of families where one individual becomes infected and … with proper hand washing, not touching their nose and mouth, you can actually prevent transmission within a family,” she said.
Recent data suggest that men are more likely to become infected with the coronavirus than women. Dr. Fish attributes this trend to the fact that women generally have a much more robust immune response to infections.
“And that makes sense because females carry, they’re the one who carry the fetus, so they need to be protected,” she said. “So we shouldn’t be too surprised that there are more males than females becoming infected.”
It’s important to understand that, just because someone doesn’t test positive for the coronavirus or show symptoms, does not mean they are somehow immune. At this point, little is known about immunity, though experts do believe people who recover from the virus experience a period of immunity. Precisely how long that immunity may last is still unknown.
“What does it meant to be immune? It means you’ve had to be exposed to the virus once before. And this is a newly emerging virus infection,” Dr. Fish said.
Experts anticipate it could take at least a year for a vaccine to be developed and properly tested. Until then, one of the best things people can do on an individual level is maintain proper hygiene and eat a healthy, balanced diet.
There are no foods or vitamins that can prevent a person from getting the coronavirus — or any virus, for that matter — but the immune system can be bolstered by eating vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables, according to Priyanka Mishra, a postdoctoral research associate with Simon Fraser University.
“Indirectly, they help,” Mishra told CTVNews.ca.
“We cannot say that eating certain foods will protect your from the coronavirus. They help to produce certain type of components in your body which help fight against infection. They are all interconnected to help boost your immune system.”
Doctors insist that the most effective ways to prevent infection are simple: wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face and practice physical distancing whenever possible.

Alright, I have some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about why some people don't get COVID even when exposed.

From Doc 1, it mentions a study by UCL that suggests some people have memory T-cells which help clear the virus before it can cause symptoms or generate antibodies. So, these people might be exposed but their immune system deals with the virus quickly, preventing infection or at least preventing it from becoming symptomatic.

Doc 2 is from Reddit, and it's more of a discussion among users. Some suggest that maybe some people have natural immunity or have had previous exposures to similar coronaviruses that provide some protection. Others think it's just luck.

Doc 3 talks about how some people have a natural immunity to COVID-19 without being exposed or vaccinated. It mentions factors like higher levels of interferon alpha, a stronger concentration of lymphocytes, and specific genetic markers that confer increased protection.

Doc 4 discusses why some people keep getting COVID while others never do. It touches on the idea that some people have a natural immunity, possibly due to pre-existing T-cells from exposure to other coronaviruses.

Doc 5 is from CTV News and addresses why some people get sick from coronavirus exposure while others don't. It emphasizes the role of individual immune system strength and proper hygiene practices.

So, synthesizing this information, it seems that there are several factors at play:

1. **Immune System Strength:** People with stronger immune systems may be better at fighting off the virus before it can take hold.

2. **Memory T-Cells:** Previous exposure to similar viruses might lead to the presence of memory T-cells that can quickly recognize and eliminate the COVID virus.

3. **Genetic Factors:** Certain genetic markers may make some individuals more resistant to infection.

4. **Hygiene Practices:** Proper handwashing and avoiding touching the face can reduce the chances of infection.

5. **Exposure Levels:** The amount of viral particles one is exposed to can also affect whether an infection occurs. Lower exposure levels might not be sufficient to cause infection in some people.

It's also important to note that some people who appear not to get COVID might actually have asymptomatic infections, meaning they are infected but don't show symptoms.

In summary, a combination of genetic predispositions, prior immune experiences, and behavioral practices likely contributes to why some people remain uninfected despite exposure to the virus.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Variability in immune system response, presence of memory T-cells from previous exposures, genetic factors, and hygiene practices contribute to why some exposed individuals do not contract COVID-19.}} \]
