As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can certainly provide you with some general advice on how a caregiver can deal with a mentally ill client. It's important to approach this situation with empathy, understanding, and patience. Here are some steps that might help:

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn as much as you can about the specific mental illness the person is dealing with. Understanding the symptoms, triggers, and treatments can help you better support them.

2. **Establish Trust**: Building a trusting relationship is crucial. Show that you care and are there to help without judgment.

3. **Communicate Effectively**: Use clear and concise language. Listen actively and allow the person to express their feelings without interrupting.

4. **Set Boundaries**: It's important to set boundaries for both yourself and the person you're caring for. This helps maintain a healthy relationship and prevents burnout.

5. **Encourage Treatment**: Support the person in seeking professional help and encourage them to follow their treatment plan.

6. **Be Patient**: Recovery from mental illness can be a long process. Be patient and offer ongoing support.

7. **Take Care of Yourself**: Caring for someone with mental illness can be stressful. Make sure to take time for self-care and seek support when needed.

Remember, every individual is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. It's important to tailor your approach based on the individual's needs and preferences.
