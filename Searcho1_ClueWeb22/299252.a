Alright, so I need to figure out how consumerism affects the environment. Hmm, consumerism is basically when people really focus on buying and consuming stuff, right? And the environment is like, well, nature and everything around us. So, I guess I need to see how our shopping and using products impacts the planet.

First off, I should probably understand what consumerism is in more depth. It’s a social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. So, it’s not just about buying things, but constantly wanting and buying more things.

Now, how does that relate to the environment? Well, everything we buy has to be made somehow, and that manufacturing process often requires resources and energy, which can lead to pollution and depletion of natural resources.

Let me think about the lifecycle of a product. It starts with extracting raw materials from the earth, like mining for metals or cutting down trees for paper. That right there can be really harmful to the environment because it disrupts ecosystems and can lead to deforestation and habitat loss.

Then, these raw materials are transported to factories where they are processed and turned into products. That involves a lot of energy, often from burning fossil fuels, which contributes to air pollution and climate change.

After the products are made, they need to be packaged, often in plastic or other materials that aren’t biodegradable, and then shipped to stores or directly to consumers. More transportation means more fuel consumption and more pollution.

Once the products reach the consumers, they might be used for a short time before being discarded, especially with the trend towards disposable and fast fashion items. This leads to a huge amount of waste, much of which ends up in landfills or oceans, causing further environmental damage.

Also, the constant demand for new products encourages companies to produce more, which accelerates the whole cycle. It’s a vicious circle where more consumption leads to more production, which in turn leads to more resource extraction and more waste.

I should probably look into some specific examples to make this clearer. Maybe something like electronics, since they are a big part of modern consumer culture.

The Damaging Environmental Impact of Electronics & E-Waste
The Environmental Impact of Electronics and E-Waste
Electronics aren’t typically the first thing that comes to mind when you think of recycling, but they should be. From lamps, hairdryers, and blenders, to ATMs, security systems, and medical devices, to personal computers, smartphones and network equipment, we interact with or rely on electronics practically all day every day – probably more than anyone would like to admit.
So it should come as no surprise that electronic waste is the fastest growing global waste stream.
We did the math back in 2014 and found that enough electronics are discarded worldwide to fill Paul Brown Stadium from turf to top every day for an entire year. And that was years ago. The faster we see technology advancing, the more we are getting rid of.
Environmental Impact of Electronics
The environmental impact of electronics dependency hits at every stage of the lifecycle. Before we get into that, one thing should be clear: “the environment” doesn’t just mean the wilderness and all the plants and animals who live in it. It includes the air people breathe and the water we drink. It includes our food supply. It includes our communities and our health. With that in mind, let’s look at the lifecycle of electronics and how each stage impacts the environment.
MINING & DRILLING
Raw materials used to create the components in our electronics are derived from natural resources. Metal ores eventually become wires, diodes, and transistors, and are even present in things like touchscreens. Plastic is derived from oil. These natural resources are limited and non-renewable; when we run out, that’s it. Gone. Done-zo. Fini.
Beyond that, the processes for extracting ores and oil from the Earth – mining and drilling – are incredibly damaging to the environment and ecosystems around the mining sites. (As a metal recycler, we’ll focus on that element.) Once a mine is used up, the damage is done and practically irreversible, and the mining company moves on to the next site to repeat the process.
Most Americans will go their entire lives without seeing a mining operation in person – because most of them are overseas or in other countries, such as Chile (the largest global supplier of copper ore), Peru, China, and India. Within the U.S., they are often located far from population centers, out of sight and out of mind. Environmental regulations around the world are far from standardized, and mining companies don’t have a lot to lose by playing fast and loose with inconsistent or unenforced rules. So from the very start of their lifecycle, electronics already have a strike against them.
MANUFACTURING
It takes several steps to get from metal ore to a finished consumer product. Each one of those steps involves manufacturing processes that rely on massive amounts of water and electricity, and have a significant carbon footprint. Then there’s the freight: moving metal from one stage to the next means producing emissions and greenhouse gases.
Meanwhile, it’s much more cost-effective and energy efficient to use recycled metals in manufacturing than raw ones. Recovering usable materials through recycling uses a fraction of the energy needed to mine new metals. Putting more electronics into the recycling stream makes more of these materials available for re-use in manufacturing and reduces the demand for mining.
ENERGY & POWER
Electronics require electricity. (Duh.) That electricity comes either from an outlet connected to the power grid, or from batteries. The vast majority of electricity in the U.S. still comes from non-renewable, eco-unfriendly resources like coal.
Batteries are notoriously difficult and dangerous to dispose of. Lithium, cadmium, and lead are all examples of toxic metals found in batteries – metals that will make their way into the soil and water if those batteries are allowed to decompose in a landfill. And speaking of…
LANDFILLS
Electronics have more staying power in a landfill than they do in the marketplace. We’re talking hundreds if not thousands of years for an intact device to reach full decomposition – you might as well say never. And all that time, their components are slowly breaking down and leaching into their surroundings.
While this isn’t a highly visible problem in the U.S., a lot of electronics have ended up overseas in “e-waste graveyards” in developing nations. There, people who are desperate for the valuable metals within the electronics will go to dangerous means to access them. That includes burning away the non-metal materials, sending hazardous elements into the air, soil and water. Those elements have been shown to cause serious health problems for those exposed to it, including brain damage and birth defects.
And that’s not even getting into the data security aspect of electronics disposal – but that’s a topic for another article.
WE DON’T TELL YOU ALL OF THIS TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT YOUR GADGETS.
After all, the manufacturing lifecycle and its side effects are present for all kinds of consumer goods, not just electronics. All we want is for you to think twice when you’re ready to upgrade your devices and say goodbye to the ones that have served their purpose. Can it be gifted? Donated? Resold? Refurbished? Repurposed?
If all of those answers are “No,” recycling is the last resort – and yes, Cohen can recycle your electronics. Visit our Recycling Guide to look up specific items and what you might need to know before bringing them to your nearest Cohen Recycling Center. And if you ever have questions, just ask! Obviously, we could talk about this all day. We’re happy to help

Essay on the Impact of Electronic Waste on our Environment
Article shared by
Technical scenario of the globe is changing very fast. The consumption of electronic items has been immensely increased and is still increasing at a very high rate in every field of life.
E-Waste is the term used to describe old, end-of-life or discarded appliances using electricity. It includes computers, consumer electronics, fridges etc. which have been disposed of by their original users.
Examples:
Computers, LCD/CRT screens, cooling appliances, mobile phones, etc., contain precious metals, flame retarded plastics, CFC foams and many other substances.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
e-Waste is a loose category of surplus, obsolete, broken, or discarded electrical or electronic devices. The processing of electronic waste in developing countries causes serious health and pollution problems due to lack of containment, as do unprotected landfilling (due to leaching) and incineration.
This definition includes used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal. Because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled (good, recyclable, and non-recyclable), several public policy advocates apply the term “e-waste” broadly to all surplus electronics. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refers to obsolete computers under the term “hazardous household waste”.
Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and even planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of electronic waste around the globe. Technical solutions are available, but in most cases a legal framework, a collection system, logistics, and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Surplus electronics have extremely high cost differentials. A single repairable laptop can be worth hundreds of dollars, while an imploded Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) is extremely difficult and expensive to recycle.
This has created a difficult free-market economy. Large quantities of used electronics are typically sold to countries with very high repair capability and high raw material demand, which can result in high accumulations of residue in poor areas without strong environmental laws.
Electronic waste is of concern largely due to the toxicity and carcinogenicity of some of its substances, if processed improperly Toxic substances in electronic waste may include lead, mercury, and cadmium.
Carcinogenic substances in electronic waste may include Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). Capacitors, transformers, and wires insulated with or components coated with Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), manufactured before 1977, often contain dangerous amounts of PCBs.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
When materials cannot or will not be reused, conventional recycling or disposal via., landfill often following. Standards for both approaches vary widely by jurisdiction, whether in developed or developing countries.
The complexity of the various items to be disposed of, the cost of environmentally approved recycling systems, and the need for concerned and concerted action to collect and systematically process equipment are challenges. One study indicates that two-thirds of executives are unaware of fines related to environmental regulations.
Electronic waste is often exported to developing countries. Increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm which can result from toxic electronic waste has raised disposal costs. This has had the unforeseen effect of providing brokers and others calling themselves recyclers with an incentive to export the electronic waste to developing countries.
To lower environmental and labour standards, cheap labour, and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials in China, Malaysia, India, Kenya, and various African countries, electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing, sometimes illegally.
It is commonly believed that a majority of surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as “dumping grounds for e-waste”.
Guiyu in the Shantou region of China, and Delhi and Bangalore in India, have electronic waste processing areas. Uncontrolled burning, disassembly, and disposal can cause environmental and health problems, including occupational safety and health effects among those directly involved, due to the methods of processing the waste.
Thousands of men, women, and children are employed in highly polluting, primitive recycling technologies, extracting the metals, toners, and plastics from computers and other electronic waste.
Such countries utilise methods that are not only more harmful, but also more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire, in order to melt plastics and to burn away unvaluable metals.
This releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air, contributing to acrid, lingering smog. These noxious fumes include dioxins and furans. Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.

Abstract
Electronic waste (e-waste) is used for all electronic/electrical devices which are no more used. Conventionally, waste management policies are desfig
handle the traditional waste. Although e-waste contains toxic materials, however, its management is rarely focused by policy makers; therefore, its negative impact on the global environment, ecosystem, and human health is aggravated. The review outlines the categories of e-waste materials, major pollutants including ferrous/non-ferrous metals, plastics, glass, printed circuit boards, cement, ceramic, and rubber beside, some valuable metals (such as copper, silver, gold, platinum). Toxic elements from e-waste materials, released in the air, water, and soil, include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead, causing pollution. Although their roles in biological systems are poorly identified, however, they possess significant toxic and carcinogenic potential. It is therefore critical to monitor footprint and device strategies to address e-waste-linked issues from manufacturing, exportation, to ultimate dumping, including technology transmissions for its recycling. This review traces a plausible link among e-waste condition at a worldwide dimension, as far as settlement procedures to keep it secure and carefully monitored when traded. Their fate in the three spheres of the earth, i.e., water, soil, and air, impacts human health. The strategies and regulation to handle e-waste generation at the global level have been discussed.
Introduction
The increasing use of electronic devices like computers and mobile phones and their short lifespan has led to the production of huge volume of electronic waste (e-waste) globally. Electronic waste is used commonly for all electronic/electrical apparatuses which are no more used (Thompson 2019 ). e-waste is expensive and has an emerging scope of electronic gadgets, ranging from major home appliances (coolers, air conditioners (ACs), freezers, mobile phones, sound systems) to personal computers (PCs) that have been disposed of by the users. Materials of international cycles require the 3R principle (reduce, reuse, recycle) to control the secondary resource trans-boundary movement which is increasing in Asian countries that have rapid economic growth (Chao et al. 2016 ). The important thing is to control environmental pollution at source, such as raw material in the industry and other related resources, in efficient ways (Cucchiella et al. 2014 ). The estimated world plastic production was 0.27 billion tons, with European Union (EU) production (0.05 billion tons) and demand (0.049 billion tons), and approximately 0.0028 billion tons of this plastic production is used for electric and electronic equipment (EEE) in 2014 (Plastics Europe 2017 ). In 2013, the estimated use of EEE was 17.4 kg/individual in EU countries (Eurostat 2017 ).
Mostly for damaged appliances which use electricity, the words e-waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) are used for this type of waste (Zhang and Xu 2016 ). However, WEEE represents both types of waste non-electronic goods (oven and refrigerators) and electronic waste (PCs, TVs, and mobiles) but e-waste materials simply represent the electronic goods (Reddy et al. 2018 ). Due to advances in computing technology, there is difficulty in differentiating WEEE from e-waste, as some goods are generally not categorized as electronic (Yan et al. 2013 ). e-waste generation has increased on a regular basis due to the incessant growth of computing devices. Approximately one billion computers were damaged during 2008 and 2012 (Ladou and Lovegrove 2008 ).
e-waste is not comparable with the industrial and municipal wastes because a different physical and chemical nature exists (Garlapati 2016 ). Moreover, an e-waste material contains hazardous substances as well as valuable waste (Sepulveda et al. 2010; Cucchiella et al. 2015 ). To save the environment and human health, there is need to recycle e-waste materials. Through recycling, there is possibility in recovering some valuable metals such a copper, silver, gold, and platinum (Ackah 2017 ). In Fig. 4, the e-waste recycling process and recovery of valuable materials are presented. Recycling processes have high energy requirements and serious environmental consequences. Because of the high cost of labor and strict eco-friendly legislation, most developed countries transport hazardous materials to developing countries instead of recycling or dumping in landfills (Dias et al. 2019 ).
The export of e-waste proceeds through underground activities, legitimate gaps, and by states without having any confirmed agreement. The negative impacts on the environment of e-waste dumping are drawing amassed consideration from a political figure, NGOs (like Greenpeace), and mainstream researchers (UNEP 2009 ). e-waste cannot manage according to policies of conventional waste management; it is only applicable to handle the traditional waste types because e-waste contains toxic materials which have negative impact on the environment and health of living organisms (Işıldar et al. 2018 ). Huisman and Magalini (2007) studied that we can recover 97–98% of very precious metals through recycling of e-waste materials. The avoided environmental impacts of raw material generation at the initial stage, WEEE disposal, and recycling are also studied by Dias et al. (2018 ). The impacts of raw material generation at initial stages are not negligible as compared with WEEE waste recycling (Nelen et al. 2014 ). It was estimated by OECD (2008) annual production of municipal waste is 1636 tons and e-waste annual production is 1–3%, in other words 0.02–0.05 billion tons (UNEP 2010 ).
In 2010, mobile telephones and computers add 5.5 million tons into e-waste (Cobbing (2008 )), which are increased up to 9.5 million tons in 2015. Approximately 8% of municipal waste included e-waste in developed countries (Widmer et al. 2005 ). Yearly e-waste generation relays on the average lifespan, no. of total units in check, and mass of the electronic device. Three years is the common lifespan of computers. Ovens and computers have greater lifespans (10–12 years) as compared with the proportion of WEEE (Johnson et al. 2018 ). The lifespan (years) and mass (kg) of different household appliances are shown in (Fig. 3 c). The annual generation of e-waste is 9 kg per person in Switzerland and 14 kg per person in Europe (Sinha-Khetriwal et al. 2005 ). In the USA, the annual e-waste generation is 2.7 million tons (2005) (Cobbing 2008) and China generates 2.5 million tons (Liu et al. 2009 ). In 2007, Thailand and India produced only 0.1 and 0.33 million tons respectively (Cobbing 2008 ).
The existing record shows that the worldwide annual e-waste production was 13.9 tons/year. Russia, Latin America, and Africa are not included for the last 4 years. In developed countries, the annual e-waste generation is 11.7 million tons, which has similar amount with respect to the above calculation. According to a 6-year-old data, again, worldwide production of e-waste materials will be considered higher. Considering refrigerators in electrical items, the mass of WEEE similarly will be greater (Johnson et al. 2018 ). Regulating the intended numbers of 14 million tons annually for 20% progression in gross domestic product (GDP) in the previous 5 years gives 17 million tons worldwide. Most of the computer substance of e-waste is produced in the developed states (Cobbing 2008; Barsalou and Picard 2018 ), and agreeing to United Nations Environment Programme’s calculations, the worldwide e-waste generation is 0.02–0.05 (UNEP 2010 ). Figure 1 shows the global population of all continent countries and their contribution towards e-waste generation in kilograms tons (kt) in 2016 (Balde et al. 2017 ).

With the evolution of new technologies and emerging economies of the world, the complexity and volume of e-waste will be altered tremendously. In recent years, GDP of a country is directly or indirectly linked to the total number of computers because to function the primitive economies is required. e-waste generation is increasing on a regular basis due to emerging economies and development of the world (Breivik et al. 2016 ). It is difficult to estimate the production of e-waste according to economic growth and population of any country, but purchasing power parity (PPP) defines the World’s populace as a function of capital, linked with e-waste production and distribution of computers per person. Worldwide, 75% of rich people have computers, and there is a good relationship between computer’s numbers and economic status of rich people (Cordova-Pizarro et al. 2019 ). The yearly expansion of e-waste is growing at a rate of 3 to 5% in Europe, linked with GDP growth up to 2.6% during 2005–2008. Figure 3 a shows estimation of e-waste of different countries by 2020. So, in the next decade, China, Eastern Europe, and America will be higher producers of e-waste if the total numbers of computers represent all e-waste (Hischier et al. 2005 ). e-waste production was directly associated with the advancement of technology. New devices are introduced due to the advancement of short cycles of hardware. In the previous decade, the lifetime of a central processing unit (CPU) decreased from 6 to 3 years (Babu et al. 2007 ). The normal masses of PC (25 kg) are demonstrative of a computer and have a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, and express the greater part of the wide lifespan of PCs in the e-waste. The average weight of a desktop will be reduced with the advent of liquid crystal display (LCD). Nowadays, 1–3-kg notebook computers and laptop reduced the damaged computer average masses (Micklethwait 2009a ).
On account of netbooks, calculating rule and related potential e-waste generation has been moved from end consumer to distant processing “clouds,” reinforced by warehouses of common equipment, which might be situated in a different state (Micklethwait 2009b ). There is a gap of data on e-waste production from these processing warehouses. The e-waste production rate is expanding due to massive assets, and shorter advancement cycles might be balanced by miniaturization and re-appropriating of process influence. e-waste materials are directed in immensely unusual means, equally under policies and physical treatment, worldwide. Developed countries really have tried hard to manage the e-waste materials and make cost-effective ways to lessen the production of e-waste (Zeng et al. 2017 ), but in spite of this fact, the major part of e-waste materials still remains un-recycled in European and North American countries (Barba-Gutierrez et al. 2008 ). To prevent dioxin release from the disassembling process of electronics, special cleanup technologies are developed (Lu et al. 2015 ).
In modern systems, in developing countries, for which China, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria can be taken as examples, plastic cables are commonly burn to recover the Cu and this is considered as the least expensive means to recover Cu (Adesokan et al. 2016 ). Valuable metals of circuit board parts are drained during an acidic wash and the utilized acid along with the metal parts leached down and dumped into the ground or water bodies—a common practice in underdeveloped and developing countries (Robinson 2009 ). The nearby inhabitants might be unaware of the hazard from the dumping of toxic metal–contaminated waste. The official strategies and administrative rules of waste dumping in developing countries are much different from those of the developed world. However, importing e-waste materials is banned in developing countries, as the recycling of the waste by developing countries is costlier than the low-cost dumping of the waste by developed countries (Mehta 2019 ).
Pakistan, at present, has no standard or correct information on e-waste production. Abbas (2011) indicated that there are 0.1 billion cell phone users in Pakistan. Pakistan has no controls/management, particularly focusing on the e-waste generation in spite of the fact that the National Environment Policy has taken actions against it since 2005. The Ministry of Environment of developing countries ensures the conservation, protection, and organization of hazardous e-waste materials. There is no appropriate system to handle e-waste materials at the domestic level. In this way, individuals have to develop techniques to dispose e-waste materials at the local level. At this level, many people take part in the disassembling of e-waste materials, extracting the metals, and separating them, and by this means, they earn their living. In Pakistan, open dumping and burning of e-waste are common practices (Umair et al. 2015; Iqbal et al. 2017 ).
The purpose of this review article is to describe the e-waste condition at worldwide dimension, as far as settlement endeavors made to keep it where it might be securely dealt with, and its fate when traded, by giving account on the quantity of e-waste produced, categories of e-waste, major pollutants, and the effect of pollutants on human health and their fate in water, soil, and air. Developing countries are gathering approaches and frameworks to take a look at the strategies and regulation to handle e-waste generation at the global level. Ecological and human beings’ effects of lethal material discharge are noted. Recommendations are considered, as well.
e-waste categories
The identification and categorization of e-waste materials are difficult for proper controlling of e-waste (Birloaga and Veglio 2018 ). Krause and Townsend (2015) cite the description of e-waste as: “hardware which rely on electrical streams or electromagnetic systems to work appropriately and the electronic device for producing, exchanging and estimation of electric circuits for use with a power supply range not beyond 1000 Volts for alternating current and 1500 Volts for direct current.” Based on the mentioned definition, e-waste material contains PCs, TVs, cell phones, iPods, fluorescent lights, printers, toys, etc. (Zeng et al. 2015 ). This also covers all parts and major appliances that are utilized domestically and commercially. Figure 2 shows the categories and contribution of e-waste as characterized by the EU (ADEME 2010 ).

Major pollutants in e-waste
As per the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe (APME), e-waste is a diverse mixture made out of ferrous, non-ferrous, ceramic, and plastic materials. e-waste is classified according to the manufacturing material and contains > 1000 different constituents, which fall into two categories, (i) toxic and (ii) non-toxic substances. Extensively, it incorporates ferrous/non-ferrous metals, plastics, glass, printed circuit boards (PCB), cement, ceramic, rubber, etc. (Wang et al. 2011; Wang and Xu 2014 ). e-waste includes around 50% of Fe and steel taken after plastics (21%), non-ferrous metals (13%), and different elements. Non-ferrous metals comprise trace metals, for example, Cu and Al, and valuable metals, e.g., silver, platinum, gold, and palladium (Fig. 3 b). The elements like As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Se and fire-resistant e-waste are characterized as toxic waste and e-waste materials are classified into distinct classes, i.e., (i) heavy metals, (ii) halogens, (iii) radioactive elements, and (iv) different elements depending upon their quantity in the electrical gadgets (Yamane et al. 2011 ).

Trace earth metals are metals which are not generally known in light of the fact that they are less used in the production section and are basic to high-tech appliances (Hurst 2010 ). Both trace and valuable metals are viewed as basic parts of the current innovation and their non-accessibility would make a few applications impossible. As indicated by the US Department of Energy (2011 ), trace earth metals are fundamental in laptops, cell phones, and weapon industries (cruise missiles, reactive armors, and detector systems). There is value of these metals in green techniques, for example, wind mills, hybrid motor automobiles, and as a catalytic agent in oil processing plant. The wide utilization of these metals in recent innovation has therefore produced an increased demand and wide generation of all such toxic metals. The main part of mining in the supply of electronic and modern gadgets cannot be ignored. Rademaker et al. (2013) reported that despite the influence of mining in the stream of basic crude elements, the impression of the mining cannot be overlooked for these metals. Moreover, Schluep et al. (2009) demonstrated that mining needs an extensive land space with activities that have a negative impact and contaminate the water, air, and land. Besides, the exploitation of resources is related to the introduction of radioactive components to the environment, and also has adverse impacts on humans (Rademaker et al. 2013 ). According to Schluep et al. (2009 ), the extraction of trace and valuable metals enhances the CO 2 emission. The researchers reveal that the production of a ton of gold, platinum, or palladium produces CO 2 emissions of almost 10,000 tons.
With the depletion of trace and valuable metals, increase in the land destruction, and contamination to water and air because of mining, the considerations have been made to overcome the situation by administration of WEEE. With present-day electrical and electronic gadgets, containing up to 60 distinct elements from which some are important and some are lethal, this material should be taken under priority (Jinhui et al. 2013 ). Rademaker et al. (2013) revealed that various countries have set up procedures to maintain the particular and worldwide supplies of these metals by the country in order to diminish their reliance on China, taken as a leading provider of trace metals. These methodologies incorporate the proposition of effective e-waste material reprocessing (Fig. 4 ).

e-waste recycling process and recovery of valuable materials

In the USA, more than 0.5 billion PCs are discarded in 1997, and 0.13 billion mobile sets were disposed of bringing about around 65,000 tons of waste in 2007 (UNEP 2009 ). In 2010, mobiles are discarded around 0.61 billion in Japan, which contain 40 toxic and non-toxic substances. An estimate by Schluep et al. (2009) demonstrates that from a huge amount of cell phones without batteries, effective recycling can recoup Au (0.34 kg), Ag (3.5 kg), and Pb (0.14 kg). The stream of this e-waste generation could be highly toxic to human health if not considered appropriate. Hurst (2010) concurs that e-waste might be a major root of rare and valuable metals. This gives a contrasting option to mining as well as guarantees among others a consistent supply of metals and effective, reasonable, and low-cost management of e-waste materials.
During the recovery of e-waste in both developing and developed states, the basic raw ingredients are recovered during recycling but are not analyzed yet (Bengtsson 2011 ). Generally, WEEE is the combined assembling of many metals, some of which are exceptionally toxic, i.e., the creation of semiconductors, circuit board, disk drives, and monitors is highly chemically toxic (Tsydenova and Bengtsson 2011 ). The CPU comprises heavy metals like Cd, Pb, and Hg and PCBs have substantial metals, like Sb, Ag, Cr, Zn, Pb, Sn, and Cu. In WEEE, Pb is predominantly utilized in CRTs in screens, Sn-Pb binds, PCB, cabling, and luminous tubes (Buchert et al. 2012 ).
e-waste additionally has brominated fire retardants (BFRs, for example, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) which are utilized in PCB, connectors, covers, and cables. Many studies recommended that BFRs have negative impacts on humans, thus be constrained or exchanged together (Ghosh et al. 2015 ). Interaction to PBDEs by the individuals employed in e-waste reprocessing industries has been considered by many researchers across the world (Tue et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2019 ). Additionally, PBDEs are found in nature around some e-waste recycling areas. An investigation of the occurrence of PBDEs in the air, ash, dust, soil, drinking water, and residue in e-waste recovering areas in China and India discovered a high amount of PBDEs beyond the levels in urban or industrial area. Toxins in e-waste materials are commonly packed in plastics, PCBs, batteries, and LCDs (Kumar and Shah 2014 ).
Health impacts
Constant dumping of WEEE, in developing countries, the innovation received to reuse the waste, is unrefined and is carried out physically in the backyard of the recycling facility. Heavy metals, like Pb and Hg, can harm the central nervous system. Lead, specifically, adversely affects the mental health of children and also may harm the circulatory, renal, and reproductive systems (Grant et al. 2013 ). Mercury can harm the renal system and its contact with pregnant ladies can influence the fetal growth. At the point when in contact with water, it changes over into the more toxic form, methyl mercury, and would contaminate the food chain/food web. Barium, Be, and BFRs may cause major human health disorders (Hennebert and Filella 2018 ). Impacts of e-waste on human health are described in Table 1.
Table 1 Different types of e-waste pollutants, occurrence, and their impacts on human health

Many human health risks are related to e-waste pollution. The health impacts result from various environmental exposure pathways. The closer the human to the recycling facility, the more the chance of having health disorders. The possible human health risk from e-waste exposure is higher for female and kids. Similarly, pregnant ladies and children are at higher risk to have health disorders by e-waste (Mamtani et al. 2011 ). However, every individual working in the recycling facility is at high risk. Children are most directly associated with e-waste recycling as indicated by the International Labor Organization; they are indirectly exposed to toxins in their homes by the contamination of clothes, shoes, and other items. This can be termed as home exposure, mainly hand-to-mouth conduct ordinary in toddlers that may ingest harmful substances, which results in long-term low-level exposure (Agyei-Mensah and Oteng-Ababio 2012; Nasim et al. 2011, 2012 ). Likewise, it is fundamental to address the contamination of the environment by improper e-waste reusing, and they are dumping on the ground harmful metals that can develop in the soil. This can cause a negative impact on health for the most part as a result of the chemical lipophilicity which is the capacity of the substance to break up in the lipids and oils in the human cell membranes (Kwon et al. 2019 ).
A research conducted in Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, studied the health impacts on the individuals linked with e-waste reprocessing networks. It showed that while disassembling e-waste materials, above 90% of the metals and other contamination exposure in individuals are from the nutritional pathway. Individuals can retain and bio-accumulate toxins in body tissues. Moreover, the nutritional intake of PBDEs, PCBs, and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD)/Fs was estimated from three recycling areas from shellfish, fish, eggs, meat, and others. The investigation found that the inhabitants of Guiyu intake nine times more than the limit values proposed by US EPA. Moreover, levels of PBDEs in breast milk were predicted for 6-month-old offspring near e-waste areas and noticed to be 57 times more than the guideline values proposed by the US EPA (Liu et al. 2019 ). The most elevated measurements were 2240 ng/day/kg BW which was higher than the US EPA–recommended dose. The PCBs were determined to be 242.61 ng/day/kg BW from food and water samples in Taizhou. In addition, in Guiyu, essentially taking an individual nutritional intake from seven types of fish, the dimension was 264 ng PCBs/day/kg BW. Newborns in Taizhou appeared to be ingesting 25–100 times more PCBs than the WHO recommendations (Sthiannopkao and Wong 2013 ). In spite of dietary intake as a major pathway, contaminated air can even now adversely affect the health. Children breathe in general twice the harmful toxins compared to adults (Song and Li 2014 ). In Guiyu, it was evaluated that 80% of the kids fall ill as a result of the contaminated air. The WHO expresses that heavy metals, for example, Cd and Pb, can be harmful for child’s growth and development and may cause neurological disorders. Laborers seemed to have typically 1900 ng/day PCBs, which were five times greater than nearby inhabitants of Guiyu who were likely to have high levels of other pollutants. Beside the uptake of harmful e-waste synthetic substances via inhalation, exposure to soil and dust is at critical levels. The PCDD was 1200 times more in Taizhou w.r.t dust and soil ingestion. Moreover, Guiyu announced comparable levels for adult and kids (Song and Li 2014 ).
An investigation explored the impact of PBBs, PCBs and PDBEs, on the cancer patients’ inhabitants of e-waste reprocessing area. The PHAHs containing PBBs, PCBs, and PBDEs are dangerous and can bio-accumulate in the environment (Ramoni and Zhang 2013 ). These toxins may cause endocrine disruption and are probably known to be cancer-causing elements. There has been an increasing possibility of lung and liver cancer in individuals living inside and close to e-waste reprocessing regions. The e-waste pollution, from determining contaminants, for example, PBDEs, PBBs, PCBs, and PCDD/Fs, should be routed to diminish the environmental outcomes as well as decrease the negative human impacts due to the accumulation of toxins in tissues (Zhao et al. 2009 ).
Impacts of e-waste on the environment
The occurrence of lethal elements in e-waste materials was seen from the most recent two decades. There are inadequate laws worldwide for sufficient administration of e-waste materials. The vast improvement of e-waste and the inadequacy of enactments have unsuitable administration frameworks in developed and developing countries, prompting noteworthy impacts on nature. Organization of e-waste by reusing and by dumping in landfills seemed to make a tremendous loss of environmental viability (Wong et al. 2007a; Nasim et al. 2016; Nasim et al. 2018; Asad et al. 2017; Aziz et al. 2017a; Fahad and Bano 2012; Fahad et al. 2013; Fahad et al., 2014a, b; Fahad et al. 2015a,b; Fahad et al. 2016a,b,c,d; Fahad et al. 2017; Hafiz et al. 2016; Awais et al. 2017; Muhammad Hafiz et al. 2017; Naeem et al. 2017; Noman et al. 2017; Saud et al. 2013; Saud et al. 2014; Saud et al. 2016; Saud et al. 2017; Shah et al. 2013; Qamar et al. 2017; Zahida et al. 2017; Adnan et al. 2018; Arif et al. 2017; Aziz et al. 2017b; Ghulam et al. 2017; Bakhat et al. 2018; Kamarn et al., 2017; Yang et al. 2017; Zahida et al. 2017 ).
Atmospheric contamination by e-waste
Large volumes of e-waste materials are presently transported worldwide to recycle in developing countries utilizing manual procedures in the backyard of homes consequently that contaminate the air in these areas. Such activities have harmful impacts on individuals working with the recycling network. For example, Gauteng (South Africa), Guiyu and Taizhou (China), Accra (Ghana), Karachi (Pakistan), and New Delhi (India) are huge e-waste spots and at this place, high contamination is radiated from the recycling of waste (Tsydenova and Bengtsson 2011; Asante et al. 2012 ).
The significant metal discharge includes As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Hg, and Pb. Natural contamination discharged included PAHs, PCBs, and BFRs, for example, PBDEs and PCDD/Fs, generated by the thermal procedures of recycling. The PBDD/Fs may exist as an impurity in PBDEs, due to PBDE weathering, production, and recycling of fire retardants (Frazzoli et al. 2010 ). It is clear from the investigations that whole biological systems are being contaminated by these lethal elements (Table 2 ).
Table 2 Selected toxic substances associated with recycling e-waste and their presence in the surrounding environment
Full size table
To assess the air quality, a large portion of the investigations is from these areas which exhibit significant effects of e-waste dumping and reprocessing, and reports show serious air contamination from brominated and chlorinated substances and toxic metals near e-waste reprocessing areas in China. Elevated levels of metals containing Cr, Cu, and Zn were identified in 1038, 1161, and 483 ng/m 3, individually, and 4 to 33 times greater than those in other Asian countries (Deng et al. 2006 ). The PBDEs related to PM 2.5 and TSP were identified at 62.1 and 124 μg/m 3, individually; however, the high contamination levels of PBDEs were 58 to 691 times higher in Guiyu than those in other areas (Deng et al. 2007 ). The air contamination in Guiyu is high due to e-waste reprocessing units. Large amounts of Bi, Co, Cr, Cu, In, Mn, Pb, Sb, and Sn were found in the atmosphere near reprocessing territories in India (Ha et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, the level of PBDEs in the indoor air of an e-waste store room was 46 to 350 pg/m 3; however, in outdoor air, it was 8–150 pg/m 3 in Thailand (Muenhor et al. 2010 ), lower than PBDE concentrations in China.
Groundwater contamination by e-waste
The major source of groundwater is rain or water from freshwater bodies present on the upper surface and then moved through minor spaces present in soil particles. Groundwater contamination happens when toxic materials are dissolved or mixed in the water (Akram et al., 2017a, b ). On the other hand, when these freshwater sources interacted with contaminated soil while saturating the ground, it can end up contaminated and can transfer the contaminants from the soil to the groundwater. Groundwater can likewise end up in contamination when dissolved substances leach down from the soil to the groundwater (Akram et al. 2018a,b ).
Regarding the impacts of e-waste materials on groundwater, Wang and Guo (2006) discovered a measurable concentration of lead in water that arises during the reprocessing process in Guiyu. The contents of Pb (0.4 mg/l) were eight times greater than the permissible level for water in Guiyu. Wong et al. (2007b) announced that the high levels of hazardous metals in Liangjian and Nanya Rivers contrasted with those of the Guiyu and reported that the Guiyu ground streams have more metal content than those examined on the surface. Subsequently, recycling practices can appear to antagonistically affect water characteristics in Guiyu (Wang and Guo 2006 ).
Soil contamination by e-waste
Soil is a pool of environmental contamination as it is typically made out of a huge number of topographical and natural materials because of weathering and degradation process, as well as particle sizes and chemical characteristics (Manfredi and Goralczyk 2013 ). There is a wide range of soil categories according to the organic matter content, from sandy to loamy soil and peat soils, which makes its analysis more difficult. Potential contamination of soils may happen at old e-waste landfill sites, where chemicals may have been dumped on the ground. Overabundance of heavy metals gathering in the soils is harmful to humans and other living beings (Qu et al. 2013 ).
Independent of the present worldwide transfer to “zero wastes,” the area of landfills has been expanding equally in developing and developed countries. Whereas the holders of present-day landfills contend that modern landfills are safer to keep away the pollutants from the environment (SWANA 2004 ), thousands of previously constructed landfills without obstructions and contain e-waste are at higher rates. Toxins can possibly move over to soil particles and leach down and contaminate the areas near landfills (Kasassi et al. 2008 ). Natural and other toxic substances in landfills deteriorate and leach over soil particles as leachate. Landfill leachate has a high concentration of inorganic substances and toxic metals. In any case, the concentration of hazardous compounds relies upon the waste attributes and phases of waste deterioration in a specific landfill (Masahiro et al. 2013 ).
To evaluate the possible effect of leachates from e-waste dumping is a toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). Various electronic gadgets are based on TCLP. A TCLP test decides whether a waste possesses a physicochemical property that marks it as toxic waste. Electrical gadgets are thought to be toxicity characteristic (TC) unsafe waste, if the gadgets contain particular components greater than TC-recommended concentration, which are As (5 mg/l), Ba (100 mg/l), Cd (1 mg/l), Cr (5 mg/l), Hg (0.2 mg/l), Se (1 mg/l), and Pb (5 mg/l). Lead from CRTs in TVs and PC screens is one of many hazardous constituents that severely contaminate the environment (Townsend, 2011 ). Townsend et al. (2004) considered leachability of Pb, Fe, Cu, and Zn from electrical equipment—computer processing units, display screens, PCs, laser printer, videotape recorder, laptops, mouse, and remote controls—to inspect the content of substantial metals. It is reported that Pb exceeds 5 mg/l in numerous electrical gadgets including PCs, mobiles, remote controls, and smoke indicators.
e-waste management strategies
The e-waste management strategies can address issues from manufacture and exportation to ultimate dumping, including technology transmissions for the reprocessing of e-waste materials (Ongondo et al. 2011 ). This should consist of appropriate training, rules and regulations, and strategies for all involved (Rafia et al. 2013 ). Thinking about the seriousness of the issue, it is categorically essential that specific management alternatives be implemented to deal the bulk e-waste materials. Figure 5 shows an important framework for e-waste management policies, proposed for the government, the industries, and the users to manage and handle e-waste efficiently and in an eco-friendly way.

Recommendations and conclusion
The present review confirms that the critical concentrations of possibly toxic metals discharged throughout the recycling process and accumulate in the atmosphere. The possible risks of inorganic and organic pollutants to the environment and human well-being are long term. Besides, degradation of organic contaminants will probably result in the development of metabolites which may conceivably be more harmful than the parent material. Now, it is obvious from the review that considerable attention has been given during the past decade to govern the toxic elements related to e-waste materials and their effective management and recycling practices. There are less data, in any case, regarding the effect of e-waste on human well-being and particularly its effect on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. These are various ways to minimize the e-waste generated at the global level to protect the whole surrounding environment. For this, government, manufacturers, industries, electronic media, and all citizens should play their role at equal levels. These are a few points that can be used to overcome the issues of e-waste:
Governments should formulate laws for suitable controlling and management of e-waste hazardous substances and provide an organized system for the implementations the law and regulation. Clear policies should be formulated regarding risk assessment associated with the disposal of e-waste materials.
Educational policies can play an important role to create awareness for electronic manufacturing industries and users on wise use of electronic things and also about the harmful elements present in e-waste materials and impacts on human health as well as on the whole environment (Fig. 6 ).
Seminars should be conducted to develop 3R techniques in daily life.
If there is any violation of the rules, the government should take firm action against the manufacturers/consumers who do not follow the proper e-waste handling and disposal measures.
Various NGOs are working to create awareness about e-waste in people and actively involve how to handle this issue, so the government should encourage these NGOs and other such organizations
The hazardous e-waste substance can be minimized by making innovation in manufacturing industries and sustainable and environment-friendly designs should be used.
Biodegradable substances (plant-produced polymers, toners, glue, gums, inks) should be used to make electronic appliances.
The approach of responsible purchasing should be adapted and try to purchase environment-friendly electronic gadgets that have less/no harmful impacts on living organisms.
Mostly discarded electronics have many reusable parts that can be combined with discarded machines to make new functional machines.

Impacts of E-waste on the environment
E-waste, or electronic waste, is waste from all sorts of electronics ranging from computers and mobile phones, to household electronics such as food processors, pressure, cookers etc.
The effects of improper disposal of this E-waste on the environment are little known; these impacts nonetheless pose very real threats and dangers to the global environment at large.
Threats posed by E-waste to the environment.
Improper disposal of these electronic wastes affect the soil, air, and water components of the environment.
Effects on air
One of the most common effect of E-waste on air is through air pollution. For example, a British documentary about Lagos and its inhabitants, called Welcome to Lagos, shows a number of landfill scavengers who go through numerous landfills in Lagos looking for improperly disposed electronics which includes wires, blenders, etc., to make some income from the recycling of these wastes. These men were shown to burn wires to get the copper (a very valuable commodity) in them by open air burning which can release hydrocarbons into the air.
Effects on water
When electronics containing heavy metals such as lead, barium, mercury, lithium (found in mobile phone and computer batteries), etc., are improperly disposed, these heavy metals leach through the soil to reach groundwater channels which eventually run to the surface as streams or small ponds of water. Local communities often depend on these bodies of water and the groundwater. Apart from these chemicals resulting in the death of some of the plants and animals that exist in the water, intake of the contaminated water by humans and land animals results in lead poisoning. Some of these heavy metals are also carcinogenic.
Effects on soil
In this way, toxic heavy metals and chemicals from e-waste enter the “soil-crop-food pathway,” one of the most significant routes for heavy metals’ exposure to humans. These chemicals are not biodegradable—they persist in the environment for long periods of time, increasing the risk of exposure.
These dangers posed by improper disposal on the environment ultimately have impacts on human beings -human cost; the health effects of these toxins on humans include birth defects (irreversible), brain, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal system damage. They also significantly affect the nervous and reproductive systems of the human body. When computer monitors and other electronics are burned, they create cancer-producing dioxins which are released into the air we breathe. If electronics are thrown in landfills, these toxins may leach into groundwater and affect local resources. Thus improper disposal of e-waste not only has effects on the environment, it indirectly and ultimately poses grave dangers to humans and livestock.
So, now that we have an idea of what impact improper disposal of E-waste has on the environment, how do we dispose these E-waste properly to help preserve the environment?
The answer is there are a number of ways to do this, they include:
1. Checking with the local government on laws and regulations guiding ethical and safe disposal of these waste. As a result of the increasing threat that e-waste poses to the environment, some communities have begun to undergo civic programs in which inhabitants of such communities take unwanted electronics to designated drop-off locations (this takes after the idea used in plastic bottle collections to tackle pollution caused by plastic bottles).
2. With the donation of electronics, some of the e-waste disposed can actually be reused, and by doing this, one can reduce pollution caused by e-waste and also give access to people who would not otherwise have access to these devices.
3. With the use of a certified E-waste recycler, one can find an ethical and safe recycler certified through the Basel Action Network (BAN), a non-profit organization. Regionally, in Africa E-Terra, a Nigerian company, specializes in recycling, and safe and ethical destruction of these electronics.
With all the above said, we all can be responsible citizens by being mindful of the dangers posed by E-waste to the environment and do as much as we can to protect our environment, because ultimately e-waste does not just affect the environment, it ultimately affects us humans too/ as well.

Abstract
Waste of electrical and electronic apparatuses generated in huge amount surround the earth today, and has become a global environmental issue. Electronic waste is a common, informal name for electronic products approaching the end of their useful life. The current and the future production of e-waste, the potential environmental problems associated with their disposal and management practices are discussed whereas the existing e-waste management. E-wastes are considered dangerous, as certain components of some electronic products contain materials that are harmful, depending on their condition and density. The harmful content of these materials pose a threat to human health and environment. Its toxic emissions mixed with virgin soil and air and causing harmful effects to the entire biota either directly or indirectly. Direct impacts include release of acids, toxic compounds including heavy metals, carcinogenic chemicals and indirect effects such as bio magnification of heavy metals. Discarded computers, televisions. DVD. stereos, copiers, fax machines, electric lamps, cell phones, audio equipment and batteries if improperly disposed can leach lead and other substances into soil and groundwater.

... At present, recycling electronic waste (E-waste) is a global problem, which is a big issue for environmental health, and escaping pernicious metals into the environment during various processing steps like smelting, dismantling, heating, recycling, and burning of metallic waste to recover these metals, etc. Electronic waste is a very rich source of heavy metals which contains a remarkable amount of cadmium, aluminum, manganese, nickel, lead, mercury, arsenic, copper, zinc, cobalt, and chromium [21,69,72]. Each of these heavy metals differs from each other in their distribution, composition, reaction competence, metastasis, discharge ability, and biological devolution [64]. The exposure of heavy metal having adverse effects on human health may also cause serious problems like low body weight in newborn babies, lower Apgar scores, lower tangential distance, lower lung function, lower antibody levels, hyperactivity disorder, bowlegs, and chromosomal damage in the lower age group of children.  ...
... Metals like Pb and methyl mercury (CH 3 Hg) swim across the placenta and blood-brain barrier, which may affect cognitive progress [62]. According to Sankhla et al. [64], heavy metals also influence a variety of diverse systems and body organs, which causes acute and chronic effects on health,the effects include acute respiratory to chronic respiratory irritation, cardiovascular problems, defects in the nervous system, urinary disease, and reproductive problems.  ...

Okay, so I've got this information about how consumerism affects the environment, specifically focusing on electronic waste, or e-waste. It's really eye-opening. So, to sum it up, consumerism is all about buying and using a lot of stuff, especially electronic devices, and because these devices are constantly being updated, people keep buying new ones and discarding the old ones, leading to a huge amount of e-waste.

From what I've read, e-waste contains a lot of harmful substances like lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals, as well as flame retardants and plastics that can release toxic chemicals when burned or disposed of improperly. These toxins can contaminate soil, water, and air, which not only harms the environment but also poses serious health risks to humans and wildlife.

One of the big issues is that a lot of e-waste is sent to developing countries where it's recycled in informal settings, often by poor workers who are exposed to these toxins without proper protection. This leads to health problems for them and污染 in their communities.

Moreover, the extraction of raw materials for new electronics also has a huge environmental impact, including deforestation, habitat destruction, and the use of大量水资源和能源。

So, in summary, consumerism drives the constant production and disposal of electronic devices, leading to e-waste problems that harm the environment and human health through pollution and exposure to toxic substances.

I think it's important to consider more sustainable consumption habits, like repairing and reusing electronics instead of replacing them, supporting companies that design eco-friendly products, and ensuring that e-waste is properly recycled.

But I need to think about this more broadly. Consumerism isn't just about electronics; it's about all kinds of products. So, maybe I should look into how consumerism affects the environment in general, not just through e-waste.

Let me think about other aspects. For example, fast fashion is a big part of consumerism. The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters in the world, second only to oil. The constant demand for cheap, trendy clothing leads to massive textile waste and pollution from dyeing and processing fabrics.

Another area is plastic consumption. Single-use plastics like bags, bottles, and packaging contribute to ocean pollution and harm marine life. The production of plastics also relies heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to climate change.

Food consumption is another significant factor. The demand for meat, especially beef, leads to deforestation for grazing land and contributes to methane emissions, which are a potent greenhouse gas. Additionally, the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture contaminates soil and water.

Transportation is also a key aspect. As people's incomes rise, more people buy cars, leading to increased fossil fuel consumption and air pollution.

So, it seems that consumerism affects the environment in multiple ways:

1. **Resource Extraction:** The constant demand for new products drives the extraction of raw materials, which can lead to habitat destruction, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources.

2. **Pollution:** The production process itself involves the release of pollutants into the air and water. Plus, the disposal of products, especially those that are not biodegradable, leads to land, air, and water pollution.

3. **Waste Generation:** The linear consumption model—take, make, dispose—results in massive amounts of waste that overwhelm landfills and incinerators, leading to further environmental degradation.

4. **Climate Change:** The entire lifecycle of consumer products contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, from the energy used in production to transportation and eventual disposal.

Considering all this, it's clear that consumerism has profound and mostly negative impacts on the environment. To mitigate these effects, there needs to be a shift towards more sustainable consumption patterns, better product design for recyclability and longevity, and improved waste management systems.

Maybe I should look into some statistics to get a better understanding of the scale of the problem.

Earth Suffers as Consumerism Spreads
Environment
About 1.7 billion people belong to the global "consumer class."
5:45
By Hillary Mayell
Published January 11, 2004
• 8 min read
Americans and Western Europeans have had a lock on unsustainable over- consumption for decades. But now developing countries are catching up rapidly, to the detriment of the environment, health, and happiness, according to the Worldwatch Institute in its annual report, State of the World 2004.
Perfectly timed after the excesses of the holiday season, the report put out by the Washington, D.C.-based research organization focuses this year on consumerism run amuck.
Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide now belong to the "consumer class"—the group of people characterized by diets of highly processed food, desire for bigger houses, more and bigger cars, higher levels of debt, and lifestyles devoted to the accumulation of non-essential goods.
Today nearly half of global consumers reside in developing countries, including 240 million in China and 120 million in India—markets with the most potential for expansion.
"Rising consumption has helped meet basic needs and create jobs," Christopher Flavin, president of Worldwatch Institute said in a statement to the press. "But as we enter a new century, this unprecedented consumer appetite is undermining the natural systems we all depend on, and making it even harder for the world's poor to meet their basic needs."
The report addresses the devastating toll on the Earth's water supplies, natural resources, and ecosystems exacted by a plethora of disposable cameras, plastic garbage bags, and other cheaply made goods with built in product-obsolescence, and cheaply made manufactured goods that lead to a "throw away" mentality.
"Most of the environmental issues we see today can be linked to consumption," said Gary Gardner, director of research for Worldwatch. "As just one small example, there was a story in the newspaper just the other day saying that 37 percent of species could become extinct due to climate change, which is very directly related to consumption."
From Luxuries to Necessities
Globalization is a driving factor in making goods and services previously out of reach in developing countries much more available. Items that at one point in time were considered luxuries—televisions, cell phones, computers, air conditioning—are now viewed as necessities.
2:49
Climate 101: Causes and Effects
The climate is certainly changing. But what is causing this change? And how does the rising temperature affect the environment, and our lives?
China provides a snapshot of changing realities. For years, the streets of China's major cities were characterized by a virtual sea of people on bicycles, and 25 years ago there were barely any private cars in China. By 2000, 5 million cars moved people and goods; the number is expected to reach 24 million by the end of next year.
In the United States, there are more cars on the road than licensed drivers.
Increased reliance on automobiles means more pollution, more traffic, more use of fossil fuels. Cars and other forms of transportation account for nearly 30 percent of world energy use and 95 percent of global oil consumption.
Changing diet, with a growing emphasis on meat, illustrates the environmental and societal toll exacted by unbridled consumption.
To provide enough beef, chicken, and pork to meet the demand, the livestock industry has moved to factory farming. Producing eight ounces of beef requires 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of water; 95 percent of world soybean crops are consumed by farm animals, and 16 percent of the world's methane, a destructive greenhouse gas, is produced by belching, flatulent livestock. The enormous quantities of manure produced at factory farms becomes toxic waste rather than fertilizer, and runoff threatens nearby streams, bays, and estuaries.
Chickens at a typical farm are kept in cages with about nine square inches (about 60 square centimeters) of space per bird. To force them to lay more eggs, they are often starved. Chickens slaughtered for meat are first fattened up with hormones, sometimes to the point where their legs can no longer support their weight.
Crowded conditions can lead to the rapid spread of disease among the animals. To prevent this, antibiotics are included in their feed. The World Health Organization reports that the widespread use of these drugs in the livestock industry is helping breed antibiotic-resistant microbes, complicating the treatment of disease in both animals and people.
Inroads are being made. In 2002, McDonald's announced it would stop buying eggs from suppliers who keep chickens confined in battery cages and that are forced to lay additional eggs through starvation. By 2004, the fast-food chain will require chicken suppliers to stop giving birds antibiotics to promote growth. Wendy's, Burger King, and Kentucky Fried Chicken have all hired animal welfare specialists to devise new animal care standards.
The World Bank has also rethought its policy of funding livestock factory farming. In 2001, a World Bank report concluded "there is a significant danger that the poor are being crowded out, the environment eroded, and global food safety and security threatened."
Not Much Happier
The increase in prosperity is not making humans happier or healthier, according to several studies. Findings from a survey of life satisfaction in more than 65 countries indicate that income and happiness tend to track well until about $13,000 of annual income per person (in 1995 dollars). After that, additional income appears to produce only modest increments in self-reported happiness.
Increased consumerism evidently comes at a steep price.
People are incurring debt and working longer hours to pay for the high-consumption lifestyle, consequently spending less time with family, friends, and community organizations.
"Excess consumption can be counterproductive," said Gardner. "The irony is that lower levels of consumption can actually cure some of these problems."
Diets of highly processed food and the sedentary lifestyle that goes with heavy reliance on automobiles have led to a worldwide epidemic of obesity. In the United States, an estimated 65 percent of adults are overweight or obese, and the country has the highest rate of obesity among teenagers in the world. Soaring rates of heart disease and diabetes, surging health care costs, and a lower quality of day-to-day life are the result.

Some aspects of rampant consumerism have resulted in startling anomalies. Worldwatch reports that worldwide annual expenditures for cosmetics total U.S. $18 billion; the estimate for annual expenditures required to eliminate hunger and malnutrition is $19 billion. Expenditures on pet food in the United States and Europe total $17 billion a year; the estimated cost of immunizing every child, providing clean drinking water for all, and achieving universal literacy is $16.3 billion.
There is, of course, no easy solution to the problem. The authors call for green taxes (to reflect the true environmental costs of a product), take-back programs that require manufacturers to recycle packaging or goods, and consumer education and awareness programs.
But first and foremost we need to reorient our way of thinking, says Gardner.
"The goal is to focus not so much on sacrifice, but on how to provide a higher quality of life using the lowest amount of raw materials," he said. "We need to change the way we produce goods and the way we consume them."

47 Eco Friendly Stats That Will Blow Your Mind - Eco Friendly Habits
47 Eco Friendly Stats That Will Blow Your Mind
Sometimes it’s difficult to paint a true picture of just how much we consume and waste. Our bad habits are hurting the earth at a scary rate.
From clouds of pollution to mass extinction of animals and plants to rapid disappearance of rainforests and ever-increasing carbon footprints, we’re putting the environment at risk every day.
To explain just how grim the situation is, we’ve put together a number of important eco friendly stats about sustainable living, water, waste, energy, and pollution.
Stats about sustainable green living
1. The earth’s human population is currently at 6.7 billion and the United Nations believes that we’ll reach 9 billion by 2050. Such a high number of people will continue to put a huge strain on already stretched resources. Food and water are likely to be the most affected.
2. About 20 to 50 million metric tons of electronic waste is produced globally annually. Out of this, only 11.4% is recovered for recycling, but very little of this actually gets recycled. The rest ends up in landfills.
3. For every one ton of paper recycled, 17 trees, 2 barrels of oils and 4,100 kilowatts of energy are saved. A ton of recycled glass saves 9 gallons of oil.
4. There are over 2.7 billion smartphone users around the world. Americans upgrade their phones within an average of 18 months. Most of these phones are still in good working condition.
5. According to Co-op America, the pulp and paper industry is the single largest consumer of water used in industrial activities.
6. Almost 100 million tonnes of plastic materials are consumed around the world today, up from about 5 million tonnes in the 1950s.
7. Speaking of plastics, about five trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide annually.
8. At a time when almost one billion people go hungry, it’s sad to note that about one-third of all food produced worldwide is either lost or wasted.
9. 48% of U.S. consumers are ready to change their consumption habits to save the environment. These consumers spent $128.5 billion on sustainable fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products in 2018.
10. According to a report by The New Climate Economy, we could save $26 trillion by 2030 if we start living sustainably.
Water waste and conservation stats
11. A faucet leaking a drop of water per second can add up to 165 gallons a month. This is more than what you use in two weeks.
12. Less than 3 percent of the world’s water is good for drinking (freshwater). Out of this, 2.5 percent is frozen in the Antarctica, Arctic, and glaciers. That means we only have 0.5 percent of freshwater to serve the entire humanity.
13. An average American family consisting of four people consumes up to 260 gallons of water around the home daily.
14. Using an energy-smart washing machine can save more water in one year than one person drinks in their entire lifetime. (Source)
Stats about energy conservation
15. Switch from incandescent light bulbs to energy-efficient light bulbs and you’ll use almost 75% less energy.
16. An average home consumes 29 percent of global energy leading to 21 percent of CO2 emissions.
17. If all computers in the US were Energy Star compliant, a whopping 1.8 billion dollars could be saved each year. This would in return lead to a decrease in the emission of greenhouse gases equal to that from two million cars.
18. Families can save $3,000 by installing Energy Star-compliant, high-efficiency electric storage water heaters.
19. Arrange desks and chairs next to windows and you won’t have the need for excess artificial lighting during the day.
20. A lightbulb with a heavy coat of dust can block up to half of the light requiring the use of more energy-consuming bulbs for adequate light.
21. You can save up to 75% of the electricity you use at home by switching off your power outlets. Idle power is a major energy consumer. An average desktop computer can use up to 80 watts of electricity while turned off.
Statistics about waste
22. Mailing a single-sided, 10-page letter costs $.55, but, if you copy on both sides you reduce the number of paper sheets by half resulting in a reduced mailing cost of only $.34.
23. In 2016 alone, 2.01 billion tonnes of solid waste was generated by cities around the world. This was the equivalent of a footprint of 0.74 kilograms per person per day. This is expected to increase to 3.40 billion tonnes in 2050.
24. Plastic shopping bags are an unnecessary source of waste causing a huge impact on the environment. Switch to reusable bags.
25. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), around 1/3 of the world’s food goes to waste every year. It’s time to start focusing on responsible consumption.
26. During Christmas, an equivalent of 83 square kilometers of wrapping paper ends up in UK bins instead of being recycled.
27. The average office worker uses over 500 paper cups per year.
28. The period between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day sees an extra million tons of waste generated per week.
29. 38 million miles of ribbon are put into landfills each year. That is enough to tie a bow around the earth.
30. Over 34 million tons of electronic waste are thrown out worldwide every year.
Air, plastic and toxic pollution statistics
31. Almost 7 million people die every year from air pollution, with 90 percent of these deaths occurring in countries of low and middle incomes.
32. 5000 people die every day from drinking unclean water.
33. More than 1 million seabirds and 100 million mammals die from pollution every year.
34. Pulp and paper industry releases over 100 million kg of toxic pollution in both Canada and the United States annually.
35. Plastic straws are a menace to beaches around the world with as many as 8.3 billion plastic straws strewn around the beaches.
36. Over 80 billion aluminum cans are used every year all over the world.
37. One recycled plastic bottle saves enough energy to run a 100-watt bulb for 4 hours. It also creates 20% less air pollution and 50% less water pollution than would be created when making a new bottle.
38. 2.5 million plastic bottles are thrown away in the United States every hour. That’s about 42,000 bottles per minute or 695 per second.
39. Currently, we have more than 500 million cars in the world. This number is expected to rise to over a billion by 2030, which means the pollution caused by cars could potentially double by that year.
40. 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water every year.
Climate Change Stats
41. The worst impacts of climate change could be irreversible by 2030. That leaves us with just 10 years to halve our emissions to avert the worst climate impacts.
42. Climate change has put over 1 million species at risk of extinction. Half of all amphibians could soon go extinct due to climate change.
43. Climate change is shifting the seasons causing falls, winters, and springs to grow shorter, while summer extends into the supposedly cooler months.
44. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere was 408 part​s per million as of 2018, the highest it has been in 3 million years.
45. 800 million people are currently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise.
46. The Earth’s glaciers are now losing up to 390 billion tons of ice and snow per year.
47. Extreme weather events caused in part by climate change killed almost 250 Americans and cost the country at least $91 billion in 2018.
Surprised by these grim eco friendly stats? Good. It’s the rude reminder we all need to rethink our daily habits and take action to start living responsibly from now on. Adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle is our only way to save the environment.

Consumers have huge environmental impact
We like to blame the government or industries for the Earth's problems, but what we buy makes a big difference

Summary:
You won't make big cuts in your environmental impact by taking shorter showers or turning out the lights. The real environmental problem, a new analysis has shown, is embodied in the things you buy.

FULL STORY
The world's workshop -- China -- surpassed the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases on Earth in 2007. But if you consider that nearly all of the products that China produces, from iPhones to tee-shirts, are exported to the rest of the world, the picture looks very different.
"If you look at China's per capita consumption-based (environmental) footprint, it is small," says Diana Ivanova, a PhD candidate at Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Industrial Ecology Programme. "They produce a lot of products but they export them. It's different if you put the responsibility for those impacts on the consumer, as opposed to the producer."
That's exactly what Ivanova and her colleagues did when they looked at the environmental impact from a consumer perspective in 43 different countries and 5 rest-of-the-world regions. Their analysis, recently published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, showed that consumers are responsible for more than 60 per cent of the globe's greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 80 per cent of the world's water use.
"We all like to put the blame on someone else, the government, or businesses," Ivanova says. "But between 60-80 per cent of the impacts on the planet come from household consumption. If we change our consumption habits, this would have a drastic effect on our environmental footprint as well."
The analysis allowed Ivanova and her colleagues to see that consumers are directly responsible for 20 per cent of all carbon impacts, which result from when people drive their cars and heat their homes.
But even more surprising is that four-fifths of the impacts that can be attributed to consumers are not direct impacts, like the fuel we burn when we drive our cars, but are what are called secondary impacts, or the environmental effects from actually producing the goods and products that we buy.
A good example of this, Ivanova says, is water use.
Cows, not showers
When you think about cutting your individual water use, you might think about using your dishwasher very efficiently, or taking shorter showers.
Those aren't bad ideas on their own, but if you look deeper, like the NTNU researchers did, you'll find that much of the water use on the planet is gulped up by producing the things that you buy.
Consider beef. Producing beef requires lots of water because cows eat grains that need water to grow. But because cows are relatively inefficient in converting grains into the meat that we eat, it takes on average about 15,415 litres of water to produce one kilo of beef.
Dairy products require similarly large amounts of water to produce.
When a group of Dutch researchers looked at the difference in producing a litre of soy milk with soybeans grown in Belgium compared to producing a litre of cow's milk, they found it took 297 litres of water to make the soy milk (with 62 per cent of that from actually growing the soybeans) versus a global average of 1050 litres of water to produce a litre of cow's milk.
Processed foods, like that frozen pizza you bought for dinner last night, are also disproportionately high in water consumption, Ivanova said. Making processed foods requires energy, materials and water to grow the raw materials, ship them to the processor, produce the processed food items and then package the final product.
This is particularly bad news when it comes to chocolate, which is one of the most water-intensive products we can buy. It takes a shocking 17,000 litres to produce a kilo of chocolate.
Richer countries, larger impacts
The researchers also looked at environmental impacts on a per-capita, country-by-country basis.
While the information is sometimes surprising--Luxembourg has a per capita carbon footprint that is nearly the same as the United States--it mostly follows a predictable pattern. The richer a country is, the more its inhabitants consume. The more an individual consumes, the bigger that person's impact on the planet.
But the differences between individual countries are extremely high, Ivanova said.
"The countries with the highest consumption have about a 5.5 times higher environmental impact over the world average," she said.
The United States is the overall worst performer when it comes to per capita greenhouse gas emissions, with a per capita carbon footprint of 18.6 tonnes CO2 equivalent, the unit used by researchers to express the sum of the impacts of different greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and sulphur hexafluoride.
The US was followed closely by Luxembourg, with 18.5 tonnes CO2 equivalent, and Australia, with 17.7 tonnes CO2 equivalent. For comparison, China's per capita carbon footprint was just 1.8 tonnes CO2 equivalent. Norway, at 10.3 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita, was three times the global average of 3.4 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita.
The results for individual countries also reflect the effects of the electricity mix, or the fuel source that countries rely on for electric power. The prevalence of nuclear or hydroelectric power in countries such as Sweden, France, Japan and Norway means that these countries have lower carbon footprints than countries with similar incomes but with more fossil fuels in their energy mix.
For this reason, Ivanova says, a significant portion of household impacts from Sweden and France come from imports (65 and 51 per cent respectively), because the products that are imported are mostly produced with fossil fuels.
An enormous database allows comparisons
The researchers relied on an extremely large and detailed database that NTNU developed in partnership with colleagues from the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Denmark called EXIOBASE.
The database describes the world economy for 43 countries, five rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors, which allows researchers to ask questions about how different products or countries affect the environment.
They were also able to ask how an average consumer in each of the countries or regions affects the environment as measured by greenhouse gas emissions (tonnes CO2 equivalent), water use (in cubic metres), land use (in 1000 square metres) and material use (in tonnes).
The 43 countries represent 89 per cent of the global gross domestic product and between 80-90 per cent of the trade flow in Europe, as measured by value.
No surprises: take the bus, eat vegetarian or vegan
The advantage of identifying the effects of individual consumer choices on the different environmental measures is that it pinpoints where consumers in different countries can cut back on their impacts.
"Households have a relatively large degree of control over their consumption, but they often lack accurate and actionable information on how to improve their own environmental performance," the researchers wrote in the journal article reporting their results.
Eventually, the goal is to be able to use this information to guide policy, Ivanova said. The effort is a part of the GLAMURS project, an EU-funded effort designed to promote greener lifestyles and environmentally responsible consumption in Europe.
In the meantime, two easy ways to cut your environmental impact are to stop eating meat, and cut back on your purchases, she said.
Currently, EU consumers spend 13% of their total household budget on manufactured products. If the average EU consumer switches away from spending money on these manufactured products to paying for services instead, this would cut close to 12 per cent of the EU's current household carbon footprint, Ivanova said.
"Any activity where we have a choice of buying a product or using a service, the service will have much less impact," she said.

Scientific evidence is creating a consensus that economic growth has placed an unsustainable burden on the physical environment. Over-consumption, resource use and the generation of pollution and waste are degrading environmental systems which people depend on either directly or indirectly for their survival and wellbeing. In the case of the most pressing environmental challenge, preventing or responding to disruptive climate change has significant implications for the global economy. Research shows that unless 2% of the global GDP is invested in responding to climate change, the negative effects are likely to affect the global economy by 20% by 2035.
The need to move to a lower carbon economy is therefore a pressing strategic challenge widely acknowledged by both policy makers and businesses. Moving towards a lower carbon economy requires a range of possible levers to be employed including technological innovation, regulation, investment, financial incentives, organizational and behavioural change. Carbon emissions are also strongly linked to the consumption of households and the choices and behaviours of individuals.
Research shows that the consumption behaviours of households account for 72% of global carbon emissions, therefore, consumers are key actors in ensuring that the 1.5 °C goal under the Paris Agreement is achieved. This is not to downplay the pressure currently placed on corporations and national governments but to highlight the fact that the possible contribution of households in climate policies is not well understood and neither are households given high priority in the current climate policy strategies.
In a highly capitalistic and globalized world, motivating consumers to adopt more sustainable consumption behaviours is an important policy goal and a source of new opportunities. Capitalism reinforces consumerism, a socio-economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. While globalization is a phenomenon driven by technology and the movement of ideas, people, and goods. And the rules of the game under globalization don’t draw clear lines between production methods that instinctively satisfy people’s needs and production manipulated for the sake of making profits for the few. Through advertising especially online, shrewd businessmen and women have accumulated great amount of wealth by producing “things” people are led to believe they want. This has been exacerbated by online shopping where buying a new product or service is just a click away. This behavior of people buying goods/services not because they need them but because they can afford them, coupled with poor waste disposal habits harms the environment.
Research on models of environmental behaviour found that environmental knowledge together with personal values, perceived control and emotional response determined environmental behavior. However, there is a gap between how households/individuals perceive their responsibility and ability to mitigate climate change and the responsibilities and roles communicated by climate policies. Addressing this gap requires that policy measures are selected that would materialize consumption changes using either market-based or command and control approaches. Driving changes in attitudes, norms, or practices can shape consumption habits and therefore, create motives for further voluntary changes.
Very steep reductions in emissions are needed if the global community is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which translate into a reduction of emissions from 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2020 to 5 gigatons in 2050, and eventually reach a level of “net zero” by the end of the century. These stringent targets in climate change mitigation will require changes in households and their lifestyles especially in the developed world. And for households to adapt, it will require behavioural change at individual, household and community levels.
Through behavioural change, it’s possible to mend our broken relationship with mother nature and it starts with individuals, businesses and governments knowing their impact on the environment and coming up with viable solutions to this catastrophe. When all stakeholders are made aware that climate change effects vary from food security to human security, to national and global economy, and have been a cause of conflict in many parts of the world, then maybe there will be positive response. Environmental consciousness will also require both producers and consumers to move from a narrative of production and consumption toward one of sharing and caring. Globalization has produced both winners and losers and winners have got to make a conscious decision to care for the losers. This in the long-run will address the inequality problems.
It’s high time consumers realized the power they have since they can influence the practices and policies of companies, they therefore, bare responsibility for inaction. However, this kind of approach is highly dependent on the availability of relevant information. The consumerism behavior for many people and households is due to ignorance of their carbon footprint. The growing mobilization on climate change by climate activists around the globe is good but until this activism moves beyond the streets and extends to people’s homes to influence their consumption behavior, a lot still remains to be done. Consumers have the power to force businesses and governments to stick to their commitments in the 2015 Paris Climate Accord through their consumption behavior and the vote respectively.
As concern about climate change increases especially among the young people, there is an opportunity for climate policy debates to focus on behavioural change. The international climate policy debate puts emphasis on technology and economic incentives, leaving behavioural change as an afterthought, rather than having it at the center stage. While climate change has become a key policy issue both at national and global level partly because climate activists have used securitization and positioned climate change as an existential threat. This global movement by young people if sustained is likely to force politicians and corporations to listen and act appropriately.
Promoting pro-environmental behaviours like recycling, energy saving, reduction in travel and meat consumption must be intentional and the message ought to reach all classes of people around the globe. Information on the causes and dangers of climate change should be clear and accessible such that people make climate conscious decisions in their daily lives. National governments and the international community need to put consumers’ behaviour at the heart of policy and discourses on climate change. It’s high time governments and businesses understood what can motivate households to adopt low-carbon lifestyles and technologies. If done in a proactive manner, it will put households and consumers at the center of driving the much-needed change.

Effects of Consumerism
Effects of Consumerism

Richard Robbins is worth quoting at length on the impact of consumption on the environment and on people.
William Rees, an urban planner at the University of British Columbia, estimated that it requires four to six hectares of land to maintain the consumption level of the average person from a high-consumption country. The problem is that in 1990, worldwide there were only 1.7 hectares of ecologically productive land for each person. He concluded that the deficit is made up in core countries by drawing down the natural resources of their own countries and expropriating the resources, through trade, of peripheral countries. In other words, someone has to pay for our consumption levels. [Emphasis Added]
… Our consumption of goods obviously is a function of our culture. Only by producing and selling things and services does capitalism in its present form work, and the more that is produced and the more that is purchased the more we have progress and prosperity. The single most important measure of economic growth is, after all, the gross national product (GNP), the sum total of goods and services produced by a given society in a given year. It is a measure of the success of a consumer society, obviously, to consume.
However, the production, processing, and consumption, of commodities requires the extraction and use of natural resources (wood, ore, fossil fuels, and water); it requires the creation of factories and factory complexes whose operation creates toxic byproducts, while the use of commodities themselves (e.g. automobiles) creates pollutants and waste. Yet of the three factors environmentalists often point to as responsible for environmental pollution — population, technology, and consumption — consumption seems to get the least attention. One reason, no doubt, is that it may be the most difficult to change; our consumption patterns are so much a part of our lives that to change them would require a massive cultural overhaul, not to mention severe economic dislocation. A drop in demand for products, as economists note, brings on economic recession or even depression, along with massive unemployment.
Richard Robbins, Global Problem and the Culture of Capitalism, (Allyn and Bacon, 1999), pp. 209-210
As hinted above, within the current economic system of perpetual growth, we risk being locked into a mode of development that is:
destructive, in the long run, to the environment
a contributing factor to poverty around the world
a contributing factor to hunger amongst such immense wealth
and numerous other social and ecological problems
Furthermore, as also hinted above, as consumption increases (in a wasteful way, which we shall see a bit later), the resource base has to expand to meet growth and related demands. If the resource base expands to other people’s lands, then those people don’t necessarily get to use those resources either. This is also quite bluntly captured in this following cartoon image:

Misuse of land and resources
How land is used to produce food etc. can have enormous impacts on the environment and its sustainability. (This can sometimes challenge assumptions on the instinct and common belief that we are overpopulated by sheer numbers and that this is the major cause of environmental degradation. While populations can burden the environment, the most populous regions in the world use far less resources than the wealthiest nations, and so the issue is more about how resources are used and for what purpose.) Take the following as an example:
Junk-food chains, including KFC and Pizza Hut, are under attack from major environmental groups in the United States and other developed countries because of their environmental impact. Intensive breeding of livestock and poultry for such restaurants leads to deforestation, land degradation, and contamination of water sources and other natural resources. For every pound of red meat, poultry, eggs, and milk produced, farm fields lose about five pounds of irreplaceable top soil. The water necessary for meat breeding comes to about 190 gallons per animal per day, or ten times what a normal Indian family is supposed to use in one day, if it gets water at all.
… Overall, animal farms use nearly 40 percent of the world’s total grain production. In the United States, nearly 70 percent of grain production is fed to livestock.
Vandana Shiva, Stolen Harvest, (South End Press, 2000), pp. 70-71.
Because industrial agriculture is using more monocultures, rather than a diversity of crops, the loss of biodiversity is leading to more resource usage, as described above. This as well as other political situations such as the motives for dumping surplus food on to developing countries to undersell the local farmers, leads to further hunger around the world. For more information on that aspect, refer to this web site’s section on food dumping.
Consumption patterns in wealthier countries increases demand for various foods, flowers, textiles, coffee, etc. Combined with more harmful products such as tobacco and illicit drugs, and with input-intensive agricultural practices (including using herbicides and pesticides) the diversion of and misuse of land and the associated environmental damage in unsustainable methods adds up. For additional examples and information on misuse of land, refer to this web site’s look at causes of hunger.
As land ownership has become more concentrated in the hands of fewer owners, larger companies, larger agribusinesses etc, and as things like food dumping, mentioned above, increases hunger and drives rural workers out of jobs, there is an increase in urban migration as people move to the cities in hope for a better chance. This then places additional stress on the larger cities to provide for more people. It also results in more slum areas, health problems, increasing crime, over-crowding, and so on.
But cities aren’t the only places that the landless move to. Some, being pushed off their own lands, will move to less arable land to hope to farm that, which may conflict with wildlife. In other cases, others may move into forested areas, clearing them with a hope to make a living form farming that cleared land. Destruction of old forests in particular can also mean loss of habitat for many wildlife. In yet other cases, many may try to immigrate to other parts of the world if they feel there is no choice left in their own country. In yet other situations, economic growth can also lead to more urban migration. Sometimes this growth of cities can go in hand with decline in the rural areas.
Due to these and a multitude of other complex socioeconomic and political factors, in different parts of the world, there are different proportions of people in urban and rural areas. For example, the World Bank reported in a 1999/2000 report that 74% of poor in Latin America and Caribbean lived in urban areas, while in Europe and Central Asia it was 67%. In the Middle East and North Africa it was 58%. In East Asia and Pacific, 33% while in Sub-Saharan Africa it was 32%. In South Asia it was 27%. (For more details see the World Bank’s World Development Report 1999/2000, Table A.2. The World Bank didn’t explicitly categorize North and Central America for some reason, which have approximately 76% and 50% urban populations, respectively. Full country breakdowns are available in the report.)
It is not always the case that, as commonly held, the poor are the ones that end up stripping natural resource to survive. Many communities described as poor (materially) have traditions and practices that encourage protection of their environment because they understand their mutual dependency. In addition, land ownership for the poor provides mechanisms to ensure sustainable and efficient use, because of the need to care for it for their survival, as detailed for example, by Vandana Shiva, in her book Stolen Harvest (South End Press, 2000). Peter Rosset also shows that smaller farms are more efficient when it comes to ensuring a productive yet healthy ecosystem.
Economic policies of the wealthier nations and their consumption demands mean that more land is therefore used to grow cash crops (bananas, sugar, coffee, tea etc) for export to wealthier countries (primarily), while other land is diverted for non-productive uses (tobacco, flowers etc). Additional land is also cleared and used to grow things like cattle for beef exports. In the quantities that some of the products of these exports are consumed, it could be argued that a lot of this production is wasteful and unnecessary. The cost to the environment and local populations is borne not by the consumers of the products, but local people instead. [These economic policies that encourage this pattern are often imposed upon the poorer nations, through things like Structural Adjustment (SAPs) etc.]
And because food is a commodity, then it is those who can afford to pay, that will get food. The following is worth quoting at length (bulleting and spacing formatting is mine, text is original):
To understand why people go hungry you must stop thinking about food as something farmers grow for others to eat, and begin thinking about it as something companies produce for other people to buy.
Food is a commodity. …
Much of the best agricultural land in the world is used to grow commodities such as cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco, sugar cane, and cocoa, items which are non-food products or are marginally nutritious, but for which there is a large market.
Millions of acres of potentially productive farmland is used to pasture cattle, an extremely inefficient use of land, water and energy, but one for which there is a market in wealthy countries.
More than half the grain grown in the United States (requiring half the water used in the U.S.) is fed to livestock, grain that would feed far more people than would the livestock to which it is fed. …
The problem, of course, is that people who don’t have enough money to buy food (and more than one billion people earn less than $1.00 a day), simply don’t count in the food equation.
In other words, if you don’t have the money to buy food, no one is going to grow it for you.
Put yet another way, you would not expect The Gap to manufacture clothes, Adidas to manufacture sneakers, or IBM to provide computers for those people earning $1.00 a day or less; likewise, you would not expect ADM (Supermarket to the World) to produce food for them.
What this means is that ending hunger requires doing away with poverty, or, at the very least, ensuring that people have enough money or the means to acquire it, to buy, and hence create a market demand for food.
Richard H. Robbins, Readings on Poverty, Hunger, and Economic Development
When the best agricultural land is used up to produce these cash crops, more marginal land is used for food and subsistence farming. This can also lead to clearing parts of rainforests, or other forms of encroachment on other ecosystems.
It’s not just food crops. Other uses of the world’s resources by the wealthier nations include metals and other raw minerals to produce automobiles, planes and so on. As nations such as China begin to rise, their appetite for these resources are quite large. However, while there is some concern raised at the amount of environmental resources such nations will eventually require, little is raised about how for decades richer nations have been consuming in further excess and waste. For more details on this, see Richard H. Robbins, as quoted above.
Many wonder why the poor cannot follow the example of the rich and get out of poverty themselves. Numerous mainstream commentators suggest that the poor should follow the example of the rich and that globalization (in its current form) provides the answer. Some may say this because they or their society has followed this ideology to get out of poverty and it worked for them, so it should work for others. Yet, often missed is where the resource base to support the increase in wealth has typically come from. If it comes from other regions then it can (not always) mean that for one society’s gain, others may not. This was apparent in imperial and colonial times where vast amounts of the world’s wealth was plundered and accumulated in the imperial centers in Europe. Yet, the consumption inequalities of today and the regions of immense wealth and immense poverty, on a global scale shows a similar pattern to those of previous decades and centuries. The U.N. resource consumption statistic mentioned at the start of this section (of 86 percent of the world’s resources being consumed by just the world’s top 20 percent) is testimony to this.
Hence, the resource base, from which to get out of economic poverty is lacking and so the same process that may have made today’s wealthy richer, is not necessarily the best way for all people.
Furthermore, if today’s poor attempted to reclaim those resources for their own use and for sustainable development, it will naturally be seen as a threat to the way of life for those who currently use those resources. As described in the poverty section of this web site, wars throughout history have been because of this control of resources. World War II and the resulting Cold War were also such battles. Yet because in the mainstream this is not acknowledged it is easy to just see this as a threat and act on it, without really understanding why it has become a threat. (Side Note)
This YouTube video from Journeyman Pictures explains some of the imbalances of power that results from resource exploitation:

Global Resources: Management and Competition, July 27, 2006, JourneyMan.tv
The wealthier consume precisely because others are poor — the rich consume at the expense of the poor. Such global inequality is very wasteful of resources, as further resources are expended maintaining this unequal balance of power (be it through military, political, social or other means). As Robbins was quoted above, someone has to pay for our consumption levels. (The causes of these imbalances are discussed throughout this web site, as well as later on in this section on consumption and consumerism.)

Exporting Pollution and Waste from Rich Countries to Poor Countries
Pollution is also related to increased consumption. That is, the consumption itself, plus the production and waste of products used in consumption. Automobiles are a clear example. Other examples include industrial waste (especially when just dumped into the rivers and oceans), waste from the tourist industry (including cruise liners, air travel, etc.), waste from industrial agriculture, consumer waste such as household waste, excessive product packaging, our throw-away culture, and so on.
While pollution is increasing in poorer countries as well, it is not solely due to rising populations, because, as the U.N. points out, and as mentioned earlier, 86% of the world’s resources are consumed by the world’s wealthiest 20%. Hence, even if pollution is occurring in poor countries, a large portion of it is to meet this consumer demand. In its September 2008 issue, the journal Energy Policy found that around 1/3rd of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions were due to the production of exports and that it is mostly the developed world consuming these.
And long before the fears that the Kyoto Climate Change protocol would encourage western businesses to move dirty industry to poorer countries that were exempt from emissions reduction targets, multinational businesses were already looking for places with lower standards.
In 1991, then Chief Economist for the World Bank Larry Summers, (and US Treasury Secretary, in the Clinton Administration, until George Bush and the Republican party came into power), had been a strong backer of IMF/World Bank Structural Adjustment Policies, which have proved to be so disastrous to the developing world. He wrote in an internal memo (leaked to the Economist in 1992) that is very revealing:
Just between you and me, shouldn’t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of dirty industries to the LDCs [less developed countries]?… The economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable, and we should face up to that… Under-populated countries in Africa are vastly under-polluted; their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City… The concern over an agent that causes a one in a million change in the odds of prostate cancer is obviously going to be much higher in a country where people survive to get prostate cancer than in a country where under-five mortality is 200 per thousand.
Lawrence Summers, Let them eat pollution, The Economist, February 8, 1992. Quoted from Vandana Shiva, Stolen Harvest, (South End Press, 2000) p.65; See also Richard Robbins, Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism (Allyn and Bacon, 1999), pp. 233-236 for a detailed look at this.
Summers was talking about migrating industries. That is, moving them elsewhere, but to still serve their original purpose — produce for consumption by wealthier nations and people. So instead of expensive changes to factories to deal with environmental and other issues that the public and society demand, they have had the ability to move elsewhere and continue on without making these costly changes. As a result, we may see a relatively cleaner environment in the industrialized world, but it is not all explainable by using newer technologies, being more efficient, etc (which are no doubt certainly part of the explanations).
This is a partial explanation of why some of the wealthier countries have cleaner air, water and so on, compared to poorer countries that are facing more pollution, even though they consume a fraction of what wealthier nations consume. Consumption in richer countries can come at a high price for those in poorer countries as well then. (See Robbins, cited above, for a more detailed discussion of this paradox, who also points out for example, that the core countries already ship 20 million tons of waste annually to the periphery, or poor, countries (p.235).)
Another trend is to also export waste to other regions of the world. As one example, hazardous electronic waste, such as old computers, old computer monitors, etc primarily from wealthier nations, are also being exported to places like China, India and Pakistan, where they are processed in operations that are extremely harmful to human health and the environment. However, minimal or non-existent environmental and working standards and regulations, old technologies for recycling and processing, etc. is putting a lot of people and surrounding environment at risk due to the sheer amount of waste to be processed.
Environmental News Service quotes Jim Puckett, coordinator of Basel Action Network, and one of the authors of a report titled Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia:
They call this recycling, but it’s really dumping by another name, added Puckett. Yet to our horror, we further discovered that rather than banning it, the United States government is actually encouraging this ugly trade in order to avoid finding real solutions to the massive tide of obsolete computer waste generated in the U.S. daily.
Puckett referred to the fact that the United States is the only developed country in the world that has failed to ratify the Basel Convention, a United Nations environmental treaty which has adopted a global ban on the export of hazardous wastes from the worlds most developed countries to developing countries. The U.S. has exempted electronic wastes from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the nation’s export laws, because the material was claimed to be destined for recycling.

Obesity due to Excessive Consumption

A cycle of waste, disparities and poverty
Poverty, land control and ownership, pollution and so on, are largely parts of economic and ideological systems too. As exemplified by the Lawrence Summers quote above, a value is placed on the environment, on life, on different cultures and so on.
This is so ingrained into the cultures of the wealthy nations, that the thought of massive adjustment of lifestyles and economic systems to a more sustainable consumption seems too much to consider. Instead the system is continued and maintained. Built into the system itself are mechanisms that encourage this, without realizing the costs.
For example, a population where health is generally getting worse may result in more sales of medicines or a growth in private healthcare and other knock-on industries. Instead of these always being seen as a cost, they are seen as providing more jobs and creating wealth, and as a result it counts towards GDP and other indicators of economic health! It then looks like the economy is dealing with this fine, without realizing that even more resources are used to support these jobs and industries that may not be needed in as much intensity.
It is easy to blame consumers from wealthy countries as the sole cause of these problems elsewhere though. However, as mentioned in the initial pages on this section, much of this mass consumerism culture in the north has not been based solely on natural demand, but a created demand. That is, from large businesses and industry wanting to sell more products and make more profits. Politically this has also been encouraged as it helps create a more conforming populous satisfied by material needs. As an effect of this, as such businesses also strive to eliminate competition by becoming bigger and bigger, this has become more destructive than what we might actually realize, and on a wider scale.
Even as the United States began to feel the onset of a recession (due to crisis of overproduction) coming on in the middle of 2001, the economic and political leaders respond by attempting to encourage people to spend more. The Economist is worth quoting to highlight that:
SHOPPING: it’s long been one of America’s favourite pastimes, but more recently it has taken centre stage in the battle to prevent the world’s biggest economy from sliding into recession. As share prices have plunged along with profits, and layoffs have soared, it has sometimes seemed this year as if the American consumer’s addiction to retail therapy was incurable. That’s just as well, because consumer spending has been the main reason the economy has not dipped into recession this year. But now there are signs that even America’s heroic spendthrifts may be losing heart.
Spend, spend, spend, The Economist, August 31st 2001
This over-production and over-capacity (due to over-estimating the expected demands) partly due to under consumption leads to dominant companies attempting to consolidate losses and maintaining profits via things like mergers and layoffs etc. However, even in wealthier nations, it cannot be a guaranteed success.
Yet poor countries suffer immensely. For example, when the financial crisis hit Asia around 1997, at a time of enormous production, collapse meant that western corporations were able to pick up almost entire industries on the cheap. This helped destroy growing competition, as the situation was getting so competitive and fierce, that the best way (for those who can) to ride through this was to buy out others, merge or consolidate. While capital fled to the West and there was a temporary boom, as exemplified by the hi-tech sector in the U.S., overproduction was likely to catch up, as it seems to have now. Hence the West were consuming on borrowed time and resources from the poor. As Robbins said, someone has to pay.
Another way then, for industries to continue growth and profitability etc, is to try and create demand. Markets may have to be created where there were none before. But, as a result, the following effects can occur:
Demands need to be created where there may have been none previously, or may be minimally.
Luxuries can therefore be encouraged to become necessities.
The commodification of food, the impact of policies such as structural adjustment policies and conditionalities have led to mass production of the same commodities from many regions, mostly exported to the wealthy nations.
But the huge price war leads to price depressions.
Mass consumption increases in the wealthy nations that receive these exports at cheap prices and demands are further increased.
Poor producers are further marginalized as the wealthy export producers use even more resources for the drive for further profits to meet this demand.
Additional requirements are made on the environment to produce even more.
Boom and bust cycles lead to various dynamics, such as
During booms, there is more consumption in wealthy areas, and from poorer areas there are more people migrating towards rich countries.
During busts, further poverty, increasing anti-immigrant rhetoric, and in poor countries especially, pushing the already marginalized onto additional lands because the best lands are already owned and controlled. In worse cases, conflicts can also result.
(Of course, there are many other complex factors, both causes and effects. For more examples, see various sections within the causes of poverty part of this web site.)
When looking at the destruction of rain forests in Central America, a similar pattern to what is mentioned above was observed by John Vandermeer and Ivette Perfecto, in their book Breakfast of Biodiversity: The Truth About Rain Forest Destruction, (Food First, 1995), and also highlighted by editor Douglas H. Boucher, The Paradox of Plenty; Hunger in a Bountiful World, (Food First, 1999), pp. 86—87. Summarizing that here:
The patterns of inter-related issues that would affect forest destruction could be seen in many different areas, such as banana production, citrus and other fruits, rubber tree plantations, and other commodities. Yet, these were similar politically if quite distinct biologically, and would typically include the following stages:
Visionary capitalists identify an economic opportunity for the market expansion of an agricultural product
They purchase (or steal, or bribe into a government concession) some land, including land that may contain rain forest, which is promptly cut down.
They import workers to produce products
After a period of boom the product goes bust on the world market which leads to cut backs, layoffs, etc.
Those laid off must seek other means to survive, and in poor countries and rural areas that may mean growing subsistence crops on marginal lands
The only place the now unemployed workers can find land no one will kick them off of is in the forest, which means yet more forest is converted to agriculture.
They continue to point out the flaws in the accepted Malthusian theories of population growth placing demands on natural resources. An environmental group in India, Centre for Science and Environment, captures this in a simple cartoon graphic:

Some examples/case studies
There are many products and industries where one can identify such patterns. We will look at some of these next.
Tobacco and obesity are, in a way, simpler examples that many can see being related to the more negative aspects of consumption encouraged by corporate capitalism. These two are looked at first.
On the pages after that, we then look at two stark examples that we may not often think about: sugar and beef consumption.
The consumption of these have not historically been as high as they are today.
Yet, sugar plantations during colonial times, for example, was a major employer of slaves and continues to be a major contributor to environmental degradation, poverty, health costs and all manner of wasted and diverted wealth.
Cattle raising has often led to clearing of rainforests, such as parts of the Amazon — not to feed local people however, but for fast food restaurants, such as McDonalds. Such demands then serve to meet the needs of producers.
The example of bananas discussed earlier, and how that has affected forests, environmental sustainability, economies of entire regions, etc. is also discussed in more depth after sugar and beef.
There are also numerous examples of how conflict and war can be fueled partly because of demands placed on resources, the want to maintain a certain way of life, even if it is wasteful, etc. Examples include, but are not limited to:
various conflicts in Africa (such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, etc) for resources to be exported to the west, such as diamonds, wood, coltan (without which computer chips can’t work),
the historic domination and influence of the Middle East for oil,
for the support of dictatorships by the west, such as previously in Indonesia to support massacres and invasion of East Timor (also for oil and other resources)
of oil multinationals being accused for killing local and indigenous people,
and so on.
Even the Cold War (which we often just dismiss away as an ideological battle, but behind the ideology was access to resources) was such a battle.
Many of these are already presented in other contexts throughout this site and links to these are provided at the end of this site’s section on consumption.
These are not complete examples, and of course, over time more will be added here and throughout the site.
Looking at some of these examples next will further highlight how in various ways there is enormous waste structured within our system of the current form of corporate capitalism.
