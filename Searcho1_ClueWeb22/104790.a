Alright, so I need to figure out if the FLCCC Alliance is credible. I haven't heard of them before, so I need to do some research. First, I should probably understand what FLCCC stands for and what the alliance is about.

I'll start by searching for "FLCCC Alliance" to get some basic information.

Christen Campbell - FLANC 2021 K-12 Teacher of the Year
Christen Campbell believes in a classroom environment that is focused on social justice and culturally responsive teaching. In her curriculum, she aims to give a platform to the voices of the marginalized by discussing underrepresented communities and discussing the inequalities of society and evaluating why they happen. Christen is very driven by the mosaic cultures of the world. She states that “multiculturalism is woven into my core.” She is committed to teaching from the perspective of underrepresented groups, where began her realization of the need to decolonize her curriculum to focus on social justice and reflect culturally responsive teaching. As a result of taking Christen's class, students are not only stronger in their world language proficiency, but they are also better aware and prepared to engage with their communities and live lives of impact and purpose. Congratulations, Christen!
Ashlee Balena - FLANC 2021 Higher Education Teacher of the Year
Dr. Ashlee Balena believes that learning a language and a culture opens us up to new experiences not just abroad, but also here at home. Her teaching philosophy is inspired by the words of Maya Angelou, “People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”  Her main goal is to create a positive, engaging atmosphere where students feel valued and respected. She works hard to build relationships with her students and implements many collaborative learning strategies. She believes the best learning is when students don’t realize they are learning. As an educator, Dr. Balena wants to spark student interest in learning language and culture outside the classroom. She says, “When students use the language outside the classroom, the magic happens on the inside.” Congratulations, Ashlee!

Hmm, none of these search results seem directly related to the FLCCC Alliance. The first document is about FCCLA, which is the Family, Career and Community Leaders of America, a student organization. The second is about FLANC, the Foreign Language Association of North Carolina. The third is about Idaho FCCLA, another chapter of the same student organization. The fourth is about Florida FCCLA, and the fifth appears to be about a hockey game. It seems like there might be some confusion with similar acronyms.

I need to clarify what FLCCC stands for. Maybe I misheard or misspelled it. Let me try searching again with variations of the acronym.

Florida Board of Nursing    » What is the Nurse Licensure Compact? - Licensing, Renewals & Information
What is the Nurse Licensure Compact?
Removing barriers to cross-border practice, the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) is an interstate agreement allowing a nurse to have one license and the privilege to practice in other compact states. Implemented in 2000, the NLC fosters public protection and access to care through the mutual recognition of one state-based license that is enforced locally and recognized nationally. Along with a majority of state nurses associations, hospital associations and health care facilities in every state overwhelmingly support the NLC. The NLC includes important patient safety features such as facilitation of the sharing of licensure, investigative and disciplinary action information among member states. Since the NLC’s initial launch, advances in technology and an increasingly mobile nursing workforce and patient population have created the need to break down barriers to interstate practice. Access to care has expanded and telehealth has transformed care delivery and erased geographic boundaries. The NLC has the ability to remove the licensure barrier to telehealth practice for more than 4 million nurses.

What's a Living–Learning Community?
At Florida State, a Living–Learning Community (LLC) is a small group of students who live together, share an interest, and take one or two of their classes together — usually in a small classroom inside their residence hall. Designed primarily for first-year students, an LLC is a great place to plug into a supportive network of students and distinguished faculty as soon as you arrive at FSU.
If you're admitted to FSU as a First Time in College student, there's an LLC for you — regardless of your major, career goals, or accelerated credit earned in high school. Once you've submitted your Fall/Spring housing contract, consider applying for one or more LLCs. Selection is competitive and based on the quality of a brief LLC application. To learn more about each community and how to apply, explore the links on this page or contact University Housing.
Students who are admitted to the First Year Abroad (FYA) program are also able to benefit from LLCs. To learn more about FYA LLCs, contact International Programs (IP-freshmen@fsu.edu ).

Still no luck finding information about the FLCCC Alliance. It seems like I might have misheard or misspelled the name. Maybe it's not an organization related to FCCLA or FLANC. Perhaps it's something else entirely.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe FLCCC stands for something else, and Alliance is just a part of its name. I'll try searching for "FLCCC Alliance definition" to see if I can find out what it stands for.
