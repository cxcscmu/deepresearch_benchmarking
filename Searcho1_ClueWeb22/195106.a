So I have this question: "What can a business do to be carbon neutral?" Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to understand what "carbon neutral" means. I think it has something to do with not adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.

Carbon neutrality is a state of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. This can be achieved by balancing emissions of carbon dioxide with its removal (often through carbon offsetting) or by eliminating emissions from society (the transition to the "post-carbon economy"). [1] The term is used in the context of carbon dioxide-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture, and industry .
Although the term "carbon neutral" is used, a carbon footprint also includes other greenhouse gases, measured in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalence. The term climate-neutral reflects the broader inclusiveness of other greenhouse gases in climate change, even if CO 2 is the most abundant.
The term "net zero" is increasingly used to describe a broader and more comprehensive commitment to decarbonization and climate action, moving beyond carbon neutrality by including more activities under the scope of indirect emissions, and often including a science-based target on emissions reduction, as opposed to relying solely on offsetting. Some climate scientists have stated that “the idea of net zero has licensed a recklessly cavalier 'burn now, pay later' approach which has seen carbon emissions continue to soar.” [2]

History[edit]
Plenary session of the COP21 adopting the Paris Agreement in 2015.
In 2006, the Oxford Dictionaries made the term carbon-neutral word of the year in the United States. [3]
In December 2020, five years after the Paris Agreement, the Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres warned that the commitments made by countries in Paris were not sufficient and were not respected. He has urged all other countries to declare climate emergencies until carbon neutrality is reached. [4]
Method[edit]
Carbon-neutral status can be achieved in two ways, [5] although a combination of the two is most likely required:
Carbon offsetting[edit]
Balancing carbon dioxide emissions with carbon offsets — the process of reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions or removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make up for emissions elsewhere. [6] If the total greenhouse gases emitted is equal to the total amount avoided or removed, then the two effects cancel each other out and the net emissions are 'neutral'.
Reducing emissions[edit]
Reducing carbon emissions can be done  by moving towards energy sources and industry processes that produce less greenhouse gases, thereby transitioning to a low-carbon economy. [7] Shifting towards the use of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, and solar power, [8] as well as nuclear power reduces greenhouse gas emissions. [9] Although both renewable and non-renewable energy production produce carbon emissions in some form, renewable sources produce negligible to almost zero carbon emissions. [10] Transitioning to a low-carbon economy would also mean making changes to current industrial and agricultural processes to reduce carbon emissions, for example, diet changes to livestock such as cattle can potentially reduce methane production by 40%. [11] Carbon projects and emissions trading are often used to reduce carbon emissions, and carbon dioxide can even sometimes be prevented from entering the atmosphere entirely (such as by carbon scrubbing ).
One way to implement carbon-neutral products is by making these products cheaper and  more cost effective than carbon positive fuels. [12] Various companies have pledged to become carbon neutral or negative by 2050, some of which include: Microsoft, [13] Delta Air Lines,[14] BP,[14] IKEA,[15] and BlackRock. [16] However, without cheaper carbon-neutral products, companies are less likely to switch over to renewable sources. [17]
Process[edit]
See also: 100% renewable energy
Carbon neutrality is usually achieved by combining the following steps, although these may vary depending whether the strategy is being implemented by individuals, companies, organizations, cities, regions, or countries:
Commitment[edit]
In the case of individuals, decision-making is likely to be straightforward, but for more complex institutions it usually requires political leadership and popular agreement that the effort is worth making.
Commitment from countries and the organizations within is critical to the forward movement of Carbon Neutrality. The Net Zero Challenge Report states that “commitments made by governments so far are far from sufficient.” [18] One way to obtain more commitment would be to set carbon-neutral goals but allow flexibility for the organizations and governments to decide how to achieve these goals. [19] Large well-known companies like Apple are laying out roadmaps to help these commitments become a reality. [20] Then lesser well-known companies like Kinaxis, a supply chain management company, met their net-zero goal in 2020 by fully committing to their carbon emission objectives. [21]
Counting and analyzing[edit]
Counting and analyzing the emissions that need to be eliminated, and how it can be done, is an important step in the process of achieving carbon neutrality, as it establishes the priorities for where action needs to be taken and progress can begin being monitored. This can be achieved through a greenhouse gas inventory that aims to answer questions such as:
Which operations, activities and units should be targeted?
Which sources should be included (see section Direct and indirect emissions )?
Who is responsible for which emissions?
Which gases should be included?
For individuals, carbon calculators simplify compiling an inventory. Typically they measure electricity consumption in kWh, the amount and type of fuel used to heat water and warm the house, and how many kilometers an individual drives, flies and rides in different vehicles. Individuals may also set the limits of the system they are concerned with, for example, whether they want to balance out their personal greenhouse gas emissions, their household emissions, or their company's.
There are plenty of carbon calculators available online, which vary significantly in the parameters they measure. Some, for example, factor in only cars, aircraft and household energy use. Others cover household waste or leisure interests as well. In some circumstances, going beyond carbon neutral and becoming carbon negative (usually after a certain length of time taken to reach carbon breakeven) is an objective.
Action[edit]
In starting to work towards climate neutrality, businesses and local administrations can make use of an environmental (or sustainability) management system or EMS established by the international standard ISO 14001 (developed by the International Organization for Standardization ). Another EMS framework is EMAS, the European Eco Management and Audit Scheme, used by numerous companies throughout the EU.[citation needed] Many local authorities apply the management system to certain sectors of their administration or certify their whole operations.
Reduction[edit]
One of the strongest arguments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is that it will often save money. Examples of possible actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are:
Limiting energy usage and emissions from transportation (walking, using bicycles or public transport, avoiding flying, using low-energy vehicles, carpooling), as well as from buildings, equipment, animals and processes.
Obtaining electricity and other forms of energy from zero or low carbon energy sources.
Electrification: using electrical energy, ideally from non-emitting sources, rather than combustion. For example, in transportation (e.g., electric vehicles and electric trains) and heating (e.g. heat pumps and electric heating ). [22]
Wind power, nuclear power, hydropower, solar power, and geothermal are the energy sources with the lowest life-cycle emissions, which includes deployment and operations. [8] [9]
Main article: Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources
Offsetting[edit]
The use of Carbon offsets aims to neutralize a certain volume of greenhouse gas emissions by funding projects which should cause an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions somewhere else, such as tree planting. Under the premise “First reduce what you can, then offset the remainder”, offsetting can be done by supporting a responsible carbon project, or by buying carbon offsets or carbon credits .
Carbon offsetting is also a tool for several local authorities in the world. [23]
In 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), following the mandate of the CDM Executive board, launched a dedicated website where organizations, companies, but also private person are able to offset their footprint (https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) with the aim of facilitating everyone's participation in the process of promoting sustainability.
Offsetting is sometimes seen as a charged and contentious issue. For example, James Hansen describes offsets as "modern day indulgences, sold to an increasingly carbon-conscious public to absolve their climate sins."[citation needed] This may also be interpreted as greenwashing, [24] especially in the case of most company commitments, which do not include actionable goals and schedules that implicate that the 'net-zero' emission goals are more than good publicity. [25]
Evaluation and repeating[edit]
This phase includes evaluation of the results and compilation of a list of suggested improvements, with results documented and reported, so that experience gained of what does (and does not) work is shared with those who can put it to good use. Science and technology move on, regulations become tighter, the standards people demand go up. So the second cycle will go further than the first, and the process will continue, each successive phase building on and improving on what went before.
Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good corporate or state social responsibility and a growing list of corporations and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral. Events such as the G8 Summit [26] and organizations like the World Bank [27] are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like The Rolling Stones [28] and Pink Floyd [29] have made albums or tours carbon neutral.
Direct and indirect emissions[edit]
To be considered carbon neutral, an organization must reduce its carbon footprint to zero. Determining what to include in the carbon footprint depends upon the organization and the standards they are following.
Generally, direct emissions sources must be reduced and offset completely, while indirect emissions from purchased electricity can be reduced with renewable energy purchases.
Direct emissions include all pollution from manufacturing, company owned vehicles and reimbursed travel, livestock and any other source that is directly controlled by the owner. Indirect emissions include all emissions that result from the use or purchase of a product. For instance, the direct emissions of an airline are all the jet fuel that is burned, while the indirect emissions include manufacture and disposal of airplanes, all the electricity used to operate the airline's office, and the daily emissions from employee travel to and from work. In another example, the power company has a direct emission of greenhouse gas, while the office that purchases it considers it an indirect emission.
Carbon is used as both a source of electricity and a feedstock in energy-intensive industries, making decarbonization impossible. If CO 2 emissions and sources are to be captured and stopped from entering the atmosphere, an alternate chemical solution must be formulated that achieves the desired output while not releasing CO 2 as a by-product. [30] [31]
Simplification of standards and definitions[edit]
Carbon neutral fuels are those that neither contribute to nor reduce the amount of carbon into the atmosphere. Before an agency can certify an organization or individual as carbon neutral, it is important to specify whether indirect emissions are included in the Carbon Footprint calculation. [32] Most Voluntary Carbon neutral certifiers in the US, require both direct and indirect sources to be reduced and offset. As an example, for an organization to be certified carbon neutral, it must offset all direct and indirect emissions from travel by 1 lb CO 2 e per passenger mile, and all non-electricity direct emissions 100%. [33] Indirect electrical purchases must be equalized either with offsets, or renewable energy purchases. This standard differs slightly from the widely used World Resources Institute and may be easier to calculate and apply.[citation needed]
Much of the confusion in carbon neutral standards can be attributed to the number of voluntary carbon standards which are available. For organizations looking at which carbon offsets to purchase, knowing which standards are robust, credible and permanent is vital in choosing the right carbon offsets and projects to get involved in. Some of the main standards in the voluntary market include Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and The American Carbon Registry. In addition companies can purchase Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) which result from mitigated carbon emissions from United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change approved projects for voluntary purposes. The concept of shared resources also reduces the volume of carbon a particular organization has to offset, with all upstream and downstream emissions the responsibility of other organizations or individuals. If all organizations and individuals were involved then this would not result in any double accounting.
Regarding terminology in UK, in December 2011 the Advertising Standards Authority (in an ASA decision which was upheld by its Independent Reviewer, Sir Hayden Phillips) controversially ruled that no manufactured product can be marketed as "zero-carbon", because carbon was inevitably emitted during its manufacture. This decision was made in relation to a solar panel system whose embodied carbon was repaid during 1.2 years of use and it appears to mean that no buildings or manufactured products can legitimately be described as zero carbon in its jurisdiction. [34]
Pledges[edit]
Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good corporate or state social responsibility, and a growing list of corporations, cities and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral. Many countries have also announced dates by which they want to be carbon neutral, with many of them targeting the year 2050. However, setting an earlier date (i.e. 2025, [35] 2030, [36] or 2045 [37]) may be considered to send out a stronger signal internationally, [38] [39] and is recommended by the Climate Crisis Advisory Group.[40] Also, delaying significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly being considered to not be a financially sound idea. [41] [42]
Companies and organizations[edit]
This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2019)
The original Climate Neutral Network was an Oregon-based non-profit organization founded by Sue Hall and incorporated in 1999 to persuade companies that being climate neutral was potentially cost saving as well as environmentally sustainable. It developed both the Climate Neutral Certification and Climate Cool brand name with key stakeholders such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, The Nature Conservancy, the Rocky Mountain Institute, Conservation International, and the World Resources Institute and succeeded in enrolling the 2002 Winter Olympics to compensate for its associated greenhouse gas emissions. [43]
Few companies have actually attained Climate Neutral Certification, applying to a rigorous review process and establishing that they have achieved absolute net zero or better impact on the world's climate. Another reason that companies have difficulty in attaining the Climate Neutral Certification is due the lack clear guidelines on what it means to make a carbon neutral development. [44] Shaklee Corporation became the first Climate Neutral certified company in April 2000. The company employs a variety of investments, and offset activities, including tree-planting, use of solar energy, methane capture in abandoned mines and its manufacturing processes. [45] Climate Neutral Business Network states that it certified Dave Matthews Band's concert tour as Climate Neutral. The Christian Science Monitor criticized the use of NativeEnergy, a for-profit company that sells offset credits to businesses and celebrities like Dave Matthews. [46]
Salt Spring Coffee became carbon neutral by lowering emissions through reducing long-range trucking and using bio-diesel fuel in delivery trucks, [47] upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing carbon offsets from its offset provider, Offsetters. The company claims to the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada. [48] Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the David Suzuki Foundation in their 2010 report Doing Business in a New Climate.[49]
Some corporate examples of self-proclaimed carbon neutral and climate neutral initiatives include Dell,[50] Google,[51] HSBC,[52]ING Group,[53] PepsiCo, Sky Group,[54] [55] Tesco,[56] [57] Toronto-Dominion Bank,[58] Asos [59] and Bank of Montreal.[60]
Under the leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations pledged to work towards climate neutrality in December 2007. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced it was becoming climate neutral in 2008 and established a Climate Neutral Network to promote the idea in February 2008.
Events such as the G8 Summit and organizations like the World Bank are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd have made albums or tours carbon neutral, while Live Earth says that its seven concerts held on 7 July 2007 were the largest carbon neutral public event in history.
The Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games were the first carbon neutral Games in history [61] through a large partnership with the carbon offset provider, Offsetters .
Buildings are the largest single contributor to the production of greenhouse gases.[citation needed] The American Institute of Architects 2030 Commitment is a voluntary program for AIA member firms and other entities in the built environment that asks these organizations to pledge to design all their buildings to be carbon neutral by 2030. [62]
In 2010, architectural firm HOK worked with energy and daylighting consultant The Weidt Group to design a 170,735-square-foot (15,861.8 m 2) net zero carbon emissions Class A office building prototype in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. [63]
Goodvalley became a carbon neutral company as the first pork meat producer. It was possible by lowering greenhouse gases emission at every stage of production. In addition to reducing its primary carbon footprint, the company achieves carbon neutrality by producing green energy from its agricultural biogas plants. The sum of CO 2 emissions and reductions are calculated by NIRAS and since 2018, the calculation has labelled Goodvalley Group Corporate Carbon Neutral. The certification is done according to ISO-14064 and verified by TÜV Rheinland.[64]
Since 2019, an increasing number of business organisations have committed to attaining carbon neutrality by, or before, 2050, [65] such as Microsoft (2030), Amazon (2040), and L'Oreal (2050). [66]
In 2020, BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm, announced that it would begin making decisions with climate change and sustainability in mind, and begin exiting assets that it believed represented a "high sustainablilty-related risk". [67] Activists have accused the company of greenwashing, as it still has a considerable amount of money invested in coal companies. [68] In CEO Larry Fink's 2021 annual letter, however, he further pushed for businesses to begin laying out explicit plans on how they will be carbon neutral by 2050. [69]

Canada[edit]
In June 2011, the Canadian Province of British Columbia announced they had officially become the first provincial/state jurisdiction in North America to achieve carbon neutrality in public sector operations: [118] Every school, hospital, university, Crown corporation, and government office measured, reported, and purchased carbon offsets on all of their 2010 Greenhouse Gas emissions as required under legislation. [119] Local Governments across B.C. are also beginning to declare Carbon Neutrality, [120] including the Regional District of Mount Waddington on Vancouver Island, whose indoor ice arena, the Chilton Regional Arena, is now carbon neutral and rely on solely on electricity from flooding their ice to mowing the grass. [121] The province intends to accelerate the deployment of natural gas vehicles.[122] Under the LiveSmart BC initiative, natural gas furnaces and water heaters receive cash back thereby promoting the burning of fossil fuel in the province. [123] The province states that an important part of new natural gas production will come from the Horn River basin where about 500 million tonnes of CO 2 will be released into the atmosphere. [124] [125]
On September 24, 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged to make Canada carbon neutral by 2050 if re-elected. [126] On October 21, 2019, Trudeau was re-elected, and in December 2019, the Canadian government formally announced its goal for Canada to be carbon neutral by 2050. [127] In its speech from the throne, which was delivered on September 23, 2020, the federal government pledged to legislate its goal of making Canada carbon neutral by 2050. [128]
The city of Edmonton, Alberta is currently developing a carbon neutral community called Blatchford, on the grounds of its former City Centre Airport.[129]
China[edit]
By 2020, China has announced its goal of achieving carbon neutrality and has decided to complete this strategic plan by 2060. [130]
Costa Rica[edit]
Costa Rica aims to be fully carbon neutral by at least 2050. [131] In 2004, 46.7% of Costa Rica's primary energy came from renewable sources, [132] while 94% of its electricity was generated from hydroelectric power, wind farms and geothermal energy in 2006. [133] A 3.5% tax on gasoline in the country is used for payments to compensate landowners for growing trees and protecting forests and its government is making further plans for reducing emissions from transport, farming and industry.
European Union[edit]
Further information: European Green Deal
The EU has intermediate targets and in 2019 the bloc, with the exception of Poland, agreed to set a 2050 target for carbon neutrality. [134]
The European Union has become the first area to embrace climate neutrality by 2050 through the European Green Deal, being committed to forming Green Alliances with partner nations and regions across the world. [135] [136] [137]
On 29 Sept 2021, EU Commision launched 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, one of the five EU missions. This EU mission aims to have 100+ carbon-neutral and smart cities by 2030 and also, inspire other cities towards the EU target of carbon neutrality by 2050. [138]
On 28 Apr 2022, EU Commision announced a list of 112 cities, which were selected from more than 370 cities, who have pledged to be part of the EU mission’s goal of 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. [139] [140]
Denmark[edit]
Samsø island in Denmark,  with a population of 4200, based on wind-generated electricity and biomass-based district heating currently generate extra wind power and export the electricity to compensate for petro-fueled vehicles. There are future hopes of using electric or biofuel vehicles. [141] [142] [143]
France[edit]
On 27 June 2019, the French National Assembly voted into law the first article in a climate and energy package that sets goals for France to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and go carbon-neutral by 2050 in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. [144] This was approved by the French Senate on 18 July 2019. [145]
Iceland[edit]

Iceland is also moving towards climate neutrality. Iceland generates over 99% of its electricity from renewable sources, namely hydroelectricity (approximately 80%) and geothermal (approximately 20%). No other nation uses such a high proportion of renewable energy resources.[dubious – discuss][146] Over 99% of electricity production and almost 80% of total energy production comes from hydropower and geothermal. In February 2008, Costa Rica, Iceland, New Zealand and Norway were the first four countries to join the Climate Neutral Network, an initiative led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to catalyze global action towards low carbon economies and societies. [147]
Reykjavík aims to be carbon neutral by 2040. [148] [149]
Japan[edit]
In October 2020, Japan announced its plans to reach carbon neutrality in real terms by 2050, this passed the National Diet and was codified in law on 26 May 2021. [150]
Maldives[edit]
In March 2009, Mohamed Nasheed, then president of the Maldives, pledged to make his country carbon-neutral within a decade by moving to wind and solar power.[151] After he left the office, successive administrations abandoned the plan. [152]
New Zealand[edit]
On November 7, 2019, New Zealand passed a bill requiring the country to be net zero for all greenhouse gases by 2050 (with the exception of biogenic methane, with plans to reduce that by 24–47% below 2017 levels by 2050). [153] [154] [155]
Norway[edit]
This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(May 2019)
On April 19, 2007, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced to the Labour Party annual congress that Norway 's greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by 10 percent more than its Kyoto commitment by 2012, and that the government had agreed to achieve emission cuts of 30% by 2020. He also proposed that Norway should become carbon neutral by 2050, and called upon other rich countries to do likewise. [156] This carbon neutrality would be achieved partly by carbon offsetting, a proposal criticized by Greenpeace, who also called on Norway to take responsibility for the 500m tonnes of emissions caused by its exports of oil and gas. [157] World Wildlife Fund Norway also believes that the purchase of carbon offsets is unacceptable, saying 'it is a political stillbirth to believe that China will quietly accept that Norway will buy climate quotas abroad'. [158] The Norwegian environmental activist Bellona Foundation believes that the prime minister was forced to act due to pressure from anti- European Union members of the coalition government, and called the announcement 'visions without content'. [158] In January 2008, the Norwegian government went a step further and declared a goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. But the government has not been specific about any plans to reduce emissions at home; the plan is based on buying carbon offsets from other countries, and very little has actually been done to reduce Norway's emissions, apart from a very successful policy for electric vehicles [159]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, in 2014, the island of El Hierro became carbon neutral (for its power production). [160] [161] Also, the city of Logroño Montecorvo in La Rioja will be carbon neutral once completed. [162] [163]
In May 2021, Spain adopted the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. [164] In Oct 2021, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez released Spain 2050 report which sets 50 milestones towards Spain’s goal to achieve cabon-neutrality. [165]
Sweden[edit]
Sweden aims to become carbon neutral by 2045. [166] The Climate Act which enforces actions towards that goal was established in June 2017 and implemented in the beginning of 2018, making Sweden the first country with a legally-binding carbon neutrality target. [167] The vision is that net greenhouse gas emissions should be zero. The overall objective is that the increase in global temperature should be limited to two degrees, and that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere stabilizes at a maximum of 400 ppm. [168]
In April 2022 an agreement between major parties in the Swedish Parliament was reached to include consumption and exports in its carbon neutrality target, which would make Sweden the first country in the world to include emissions from international trade in the pledges to mitigate climate change. [169]
South Korea[edit]
South Korea aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, [170] and enacted, on August 31, 2021, the enactment of the Carbon Neutral and Green Growth Basic Act, which stipulates the achievement of greenhouse gas reduction. [108] This bill, also called the 'Climate Crisis Response Act', mandates, by 2030, a 35% greenhouse gas reduction in the country compared to 2018. [108]
Vatican City[edit]
In July 2007, Vatican City announced a plan to become the first carbon-neutral state in the world, following the politics of the Pope to eliminate global warming. The goal would have been reached through a forest donated by a carbon offsetting company, which would have been located in the Bükk National Park, Hungary.[171] Eventually no trees were planted under the project and the carbon offsets did not materialise. [172] [173]
In November 2008, the city state also installed and put into operation 2,400 solar panels on the roof of the Paul VI Centre audience hall. [174]
United Kingdom[edit]
As recommended by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) the government has legally committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom by 2050 [175] and the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has said it would be affordable. A range of techniques will be required including carbon sinks (greenhouse gas removal) in order to counterbalance emissions from agriculture and aviation. These carbon sinks might include reforestation, habitat restoration, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and even direct air capture.[176] The UK government has recently linked attainment of net zero targets as a potential mechanism for improved air quality as a co-benefit. [177] In 2020 the UK government estimated that eliminating fossil fuels for home heating and transportation could lead to a tripling of demand for electricity. [178]
Scotland[edit]
Scotland has set a 2045 target. [179] The islands of Orkney have significant wind and marine energy resources, and renewable energy has recently come into prominence. Although Orkney is connected to the mainland, it generates over 100% of its net power from renewables. [180][unreliable source?] This comes mainly from wind turbines situated right across Orkney
Carbon neutral initiatives[edit]
Many initiatives seek to assist individuals, businesses and states in reducing their carbon footprint or achieving climate neutrality. These include:
Australian Government Climate Active carbon neutral certification;
Climate Neutral Network;
Caring for Climate;
Carbon Neutrality Coalition;
Pathzero - Smart emission management platform for businesses to go carbon neutral;
Leader for Climate Action;
GreenWise - Complete and simple SaaS platform and consultancy service for your business to go carbon neutral;
GreenLife - Daily tips on sustainability for individuals to become carbon neutral;
The Greater Green Project: An Initiative by Forestry & Citrus Research to plant 1 billion trees by 2030 in Zimbabwe. The Project is an inspiration in the Global South towards Carbon Neutrality; and
#2050challenge by Royal Society – Sharing research by scientists about reaching net zero emissions by 2050.
Certification[edit]
Although there is currently no international certification scheme for carbon or climate neutrality, some countries have established national certification schemes. Examples include Norwegian Eco-Lighthouse Program and the Australian government's Climate Active certification. In the private sector, organizations such as ClimatePartner can, for a fee, allow companies from many sectors to offset their carbon emissions using techniques like reforestation. These companies can then claim climate neutral status and even use the title online. However, there is no international clarity around these certifications and their validity.
Certifications are also available from the CEB,[181] BSI (PAS 2060) and The CarbonNeutral Company (CarbonNeutral). [182]
Criticism[edit]
Tracing the history of certain illusions in climate policy from 1988 to 2021, climate scientists James Dyke, Robert Watson, and Wolfgang Knorr "[arrive] at the painful realisation that the idea of net zero has licensed a recklessly cavalier 'burn now, pay later' approach which has seen carbon emissions continue to soar...
Current net zero policies will not keep warming to within 1.5°C because they were never intended to. They were and still are driven by a need to protect business as usual, not the climate. If we want to keep people safe then large and sustained cuts to carbon emissions need to happen now.…The time for wishful thinking is over.” [2]
In March 2021, Tzeporah Berman, chair of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, argued that the Treaty would be a more genuine and realistic way to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement than the "Net zero" approach which, she claimed, is "delusional and based on bad science." [183]
Eric Reguly, of the Globe and Mail states that, “The net-zero pledges are both welcome and dubious.
Most are back-end loaded, meaning the majority of the cuts are to come well after 2030...Most of these targets also assume...steady technological advances and outright breakthroughs...Fossil fuel exports will not figure into the national accounting for the net-zero goal.” [184]
In his 16-page report, Dangerous Distractions, economist Marc Lee states that, “‘Net zero’ has the potential to be a dangerous distraction that reduces the political pressure to achieve actual emission reductions…” [185] [186] "A net zero target means less incentive to get to 'real zero' emissions from fossil fuels, an escape hatch that perpetuates business as usual and delays more meaningful climate action...Rather than gambling on carbon removal technologies of the future, Canada should plan for a managed wind down of fossil fuel production and invest public resources in bona fide solutions like renewables and a just transition from fossil fuels.” [186] [185]

In addition to the six nuclear plants going offline by 2030, there's another challenge. You have to factor in a massive increase in electricity demand over the coming decades. That's because if we're going to reach our net zero target, we need to stop using fossil fuels for transport and home heating.

Carbon neutral – What does that actually mean?  | ClimatePartner
What Does That Actually Mean?
Home
Carbon neutral definition
Companies, processes and products become carbon neutral when they calculate their carbon emissions and compensate for what they have produced via carbon offsetting projects. Offsetting carbon emissions, in addition to avoidance and reduction, is an important step in holistic climate action.
Greenhouse gases such as CO 2 disperse uniformly in the atmosphere, this means that the concentration of greenhouse gases is approximately the same all over the world. Consequently, in terms of the global concentration of greenhouse gases and the greenhouse gas effect, it is irrelevant where on the planet emissions are produced or avoided. Therefore, emissions that cannot be avoided locally can be offset by carbon offset projects in another location. For example, this can be done by means of forest conservation, afforestation or renewable energy expansion.
Carbon neutral does not mean carbon free
The terms carbon free and carbon neutral are often confused, however, they refer to distinct aspects of climate action. Carbon-free products, services or companies are those that do not generate any carbon emissions during the manufacturing, provision or operational process. This must apply to the entire supply chain, including all the raw materials, logistics and packaging. In actual fact, there are no examples (yet) of carbon-free products.
Conversely, any company and any product can be carbon neutral: there are current standards to calculate their emissions, and companies can support certified carbon offset projects in order to offset the emissions calculated.
Credibly carbon neutral
Companies achieve the highest degree of credibility – and the greatest positive impact on our climate – if, in addition to carbon offsetting, they also pursue a transparent carbon avoidance and reduction strategy for their carbon neutral products and their company. An example of this is the grocery retailer ALDI Süd: Since 2012, it has reduced its carbon footprint by 66 percent and, as of 2017, it is also carbon neutral. Reducing carbon emissions even further is an ongoing challenge within the company. They use their carbon footprint as a basis for setting long-term reduction targets and deciding what action to take. Some steps also bring rapid success: for example, the switch to green electricity. However, in many cases, the potential for reductions in carbon emissions is restricted – at least in the short term. It is not possible for a haulage company, for example, to replace its entire fleet of trucks from one day to the next, but maximum efficiency can be achieved incrementally through driver training and the optimisation of the carbon emission load factor per tonne-kilometre. Notwithstanding this, the company should initiate the carbon offsetting process right away and become carbon neutral as soon as possible.
Transparently carbon neutral
Official proof of credible carbon neutrality is important to consumers. Carbon neutrality must be verified by means of a recognised label. To this end, ClimatePartner already developed its own label and verification system years ago that is easy for companies to use and that allows them to communicate their own carbon neutrality in a transparent way. It involves assigning an ID number for each carbon offset allowing the offset to be tracked and verified online. This is backed up by the guarantee that the corresponding carbon emissions have been offset by ClimatePartner. This process is reviewed annually by TÜV (Technischer Überwachungsverein) Austria.

Alright, so I've got this question: "What can a business do to be carbon neutral?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what "carbon neutral" means. I think it has something to do with not adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.

Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923), the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremony.
The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he rendered by the discovery of X-rays. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2021 a total of 219 individuals have been awarded the prize. [2]

Background[edit]
Alfred Nobel, in his last will and testament, stated that his wealth should be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[3] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. [4] [5] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor (US $198 million, € 176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes. [6] Owing to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament). [7] [8] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.
The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The other prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. [9] [10] The Nobel Foundation then established guidelines for awarding the prizes. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[8] [11] According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences would award the Prize in Physics. [11]
Nomination and selection[edit]
Three Nobel Laureates in Physics. Front row L-R: Albert A. Michelson (1907 laureate), Albert Einstein (1921 laureate) and Robert A. Millikan (1923 laureate).
A maximum of three Nobel laureates and two different works may be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics. [12] Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance over the years to become the most important prize in Physics. [13]
The Nobel laureates are selected by the Nobel Committee for Physics, a Nobel Committee that consists of five members elected by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. During the first stage that begins in September, a group of about 3,000 selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and others are sent confidential nomination forms. The completed forms must arrive at the Nobel Committee by 31 January of the following year. The nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts and are narrowed to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates to the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics by a majority vote. [14]
The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. [15] While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the candidate had died after being nominated. [16]
The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been "tested by time". In practice, that means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated. [17] [18]
Prizes[edit]
A Physics Nobel Prize laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money. [19]
Medals[edit]
The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket [20] in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. [21] [22] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of the Goddess of Nature, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals, along with those for Physiology/Medicine and Literature, were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902. [23]
Diplomas[edit]
1903 Nobel Prize diploma, awarded to Marie Curie and Pierre Curie
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it. [24] The diploma contains a picture with the name of the laureate and normally a citation explaining their accomplishments. [24]
Award money[edit]
At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel Foundation. For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million), [25] but in 2012 following the Great Recession, the amount was 8 million Swedish Kronor, or US$1.1 million. [26] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others. [27] [28] [29] [30]
Ceremony[edit]
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates during the first week of October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in Stockholm Concert Hall on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount. [31]

After Nobel’s death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions.

List of Nobel laureates in Physics
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Front side (obverse) of the Nobel Prize Medal for Physics presented to Edward Victor Appleton in 1947
The Nobel Prize in Physics (Swedish: Nobelpriset i fysik) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in physics. [1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. [2] The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. [3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. [4]

Statistics[edit]
The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972. Marie Skłodowska-Curie also won two Nobel Prizes, for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911. William Lawrence Bragg was, until October 2014, the youngest ever Nobel laureate; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25.  He remains the youngest recipient of the Physics Prize. [5] Four women have won the prize: Curie, Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), and Andrea Ghez (2020). [6] As of 2021, the prize has been awarded to 218 individuals. [7]
There have been six years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was delayed for one year:
The 1914 prize awarded to Max von Laue was announced only in November 1915. [8]
The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize. [9]
This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919, [10]
the 1921 prize awarded to Albert Einstein in 1922, [11]
the 1924 prize awarded to Manne Siegbahn in 1925, [12]
the 1925 prize awarded to James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1926, [13]
the 1928 prize awarded to Owen Richardson in 1929, [14]
the 1932 prize awarded to Werner Heisenberg in 1933, [15] and
the 1943 prize awarded to Otto Stern in 1944. [16]
Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prize for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 are clustered in few disciplines. Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honored physics disciplines. [17]
