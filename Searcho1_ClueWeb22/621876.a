Alright, so I need to list the pros and cons of probation. I'm not entirely sure what probation is, to be honest, so maybe I should start by understanding what it means. I think probation is when someone who has been convicted of a crime is allowed to stay out of jail under certain conditions, like regular check-ins with a probation officer. But I'm not completely sure, so I should probably look that up first.

Probation legal definition of Probation
Probation
Also found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Medical, Financial, Idioms, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia.
Probation
A sentence whereby a convict is released from confinement but is still under court supervision; a testing or a trial period. Probation can be given in lieu of a prison term or can suspend a prison sentence if the convict has consistently demonstrated good behavior.
The status of a convicted person who is given some freedom on the condition that for a specified period he or she act in a manner approved by a special officer to whom the person must report.
An initial period of employment during which a new, transferred, or promoted employee must show the ability to perform the required duties.
Probation is the period during which a person, "the probationer," is subject to critical examination and evaluation. The word probation is derived from probatum,Latin for "the act of proving." Probation is a trial period that must be completed before a person receives greater benefits or freedom.
In the criminal justice system probation is a particular type of sentence for criminal defendants. The judicial authority to order a sentence of probation is granted in statutes on the federal and state levels. Generally, probation allows a convicted defendant to go free with a suspended sentence for a specified duration during good behavior. Probationers are placed under the supervision of a probation officer and must fulfill certain conditions. If the probationer violates a condition of probation, the court may place additional restrictions on the probationer or order the probationer to serve a term of imprisonment.
A judge also may order probation in addition to a period of incarceration. For example, a sentence might consist of a jail term and, after release, probation for a specified period of months or years. Probation is generally reserved for persons sentenced to short terms in jail: it is not combined with a long prison sentence. If a person is subjected to supervision after a stay in prison, the supervision is conducted by a Parole officer.
Both probation and parole involve the supervision of convicted criminals, but the systems are distinct. Probation is ordered by a judge; parole is granted by a parole board. Probation is an alternative to prison; parole is the early release from prison. Probation is reserved for persons convicted of less serious offenses; parole is given to persons convicted of serious offenses.
The concept of probation in the Criminal Law was inspired in the mid-nineteenth century by John Augustus,a resident of Boston. Augustus encountered a man about to be sentenced in a Boston court and believed him to be capable of reform. Augustus posted bail for the man and succeeded in getting his sentence reduced. From 1841 to 1859 Massachusetts judges released approximately 2000 offenders into Augustus's custody instead of ordering incarceration.
In 1878 Massachusetts enacted the first probation statute, and Boston hired its first probation officer. In 1880 the Massachusetts legislature approved the first statewide hiring of probation officers. By 1925 all states had laws governing probation for juveniles, and by 1939 approximately 39 states were maintaining laws on probation for adults. By 1967 adult probation was allowed by statute in all states.
Probation statutes generally identify the crimes available for a sentence of probation, or, conversely, they identify crimes for which probation may not be ordered. In Alaska, for example, a court may not order probation if the person has been convicted of sexual assault or if the person's conviction is his second assault or Robbery offense within the previous ten years (Alaska Stat. § 12.55.085 [1965]).
Statutes may also identify conditions of probation. These are actions that a probationer must do or refrain from doing during probation. Though conditions may be spelled out in statutes, a sentencing judge retains wide discretion to fashion conditions according to the best interests of both the public and the defendant. In most states a probationer must not possess a firearm, commit another offense, or possess illegal drugs during the probation period. Probationers must also report regularly to a probation officer.
A judge may place additional conditions on a probationer. For example, if a defendant pleads guilty to assault, the court may order him to stay a specified distance away from the victim of the assault. In a conviction for a small amount of marijuana a judge may order the defendant to complete treatment for drug use. If a probationer violates any condition of probation, the court may order additional conditions or impose a prison sentence that does not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that could have been imposed for the crime.
Judges in state court generally have wide discretion in sentencing. In determining whether to sentence a defendant to probation, the court may consider a variety of factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant's criminal history.
Probation became a sentencing option for federal judges with the 1925 passage of the Federal Probation Act (18 U.S.C.A. § 3651). This act authorized federal courts to suspend imposition of a sentence, or the execution of a sentence, in favor of probation. A defendant could be placed on up to five years' probation "upon such terms and conditions as the court deemed best" when the court was satisfied that "the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant [would] be served thereby."
Probation as a criminal sentence was the product of a reform movement in the criminal justice system in the early twentieth century. Part of this movement was devoted to Abolition of determinate sentencing or the legislative imposition of specific sentences for specific crimes. The reform movement fought for indeterminate sentencing, a method that left sentencing to the discretion of the judge and allowed the judge to fashion a sentence according to the rehabilitative needs of the criminal defendant.
Congress reversed indeterminate sentencing in federal court with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 3551–3556). The act replaced the Federal Probation Act and established sentencing guidelines for federal judges, allowing a judge to order probation only if the offense calls for a term of imprisonment of six months or less. The act lists offenses for which revocation of probation and imposition of imprisonment are mandatory.
The Sentencing Act also changed the role of federal probation officers in the federal criminal justice system. Under the act, probation officers must gather and present evidence on facts relevant to the sentencing guidelines. This is a shift in the focus of probation officers' work. Probation officers once worked to ensure that the sentence fit the individual offender, but subsequently they endeavored to ensure that the defendant's sentence fits the offenses charged. In other words, the probation officer became less like a social worker intent on the rehabilitation of the probationer and more like an informant for the court against the probationer.
Revocation of probation in federal court in conjunction with the federal sentencing guidelines has led to confusion over the application of probation. In United States v. Granderson,511 U.S. 39, 114 S. Ct. 1259, 127 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1994), Ralph Stuart Granderson Jr. was convicted of destruction of mail and sentenced to five years' probation and a fine. While on probation, Granderson tested positive for cocaine. Under 18 U.S.C.A. § 3565 (a) (1984), the court was required to revoke Granderson's probation "and sentence [him] to not less than one-third of the original sentence."
At the revocation hearing the government argued that this requirement meant a term of imprisonment not less than one-third the probationary period originally ordered by the court. The court agreed and resentenced Granderson to 60 months in prison. Under the federal sentencing guidelines, Granderson could have been initially sentenced to a term of imprisonment between zero and six months.
Granderson appealed, arguing that "original sentence" did not mean a term of imprisonment equal to the length of the probationary sentence imposed but instead referred to the prison sentence that the judge initially could have ordered. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed and vacated Granderson's sentence and ordered his release from prison. According to the court of appeals, it was "legal alchemy" to convert a long-term sentence of conditional liberty into an equally long term of imprisonment(United States v. Granderson,969 F.2d 980 [11th Cir. 1992]). The federal government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed the ruling.

probation
n. a chance to remain free (or serve only a short time) given by a judge to a person convicted of a crime instead of being sent to jail or prison, provided the person can be good. Probation is only given under specific court-ordered terms, such as performing public service work, staying away from liquor, paying a fine, maintaining good behavior, getting mental therapy, and reporting regularly to a probation officer. Violation of probation terms will usually result in the person being sent to jail for the normal term. Repeat criminals are normally not eligible for probation. Probation is not the same as "parole," which is freedom under certain restrictions given to convicts at the end of their imprisonment. (See: parole, sentence)

What is the legal definition of probation?
What is the legal definition of probation?
Probation is a legal punishment imposed by the judicial system. In criminal law, Probation is a term of monitoring on a convict enforced by a judge rather than jail time. Mostly, Probation only extends to custodial sentences, such as prison terms.
What is probation?
Probation is the duration where the convict is released conditionally from jail to parole. An individual on Probation is expected to meet specific court-imposed requirements and is regularly supervised by a caseworker.
If an inmate is found to violate the laws during this training time, he or she may be sent back to prison. Inmates are generally forbidden from possessing weapons and might be required to stay working, conform to a curfew, remain in a specified location. Also, follow the probation officer’s instructions, or otherwise not escape their region.
Probation statement
Further, to know what is probation, understanding the probation statement is essential. It would provide information about the prisoner, his or her family, and their activities. Likewise, he or she is not an alcoholic person. It could evaluate the inmate’s mindset, including whether they accept consideration for his or her acts. This will examine whether the defendant is serious about changing his or her attitude or activities, such as whether they are sincere about enrolling in a drug recovery program or not.
Probation requirements
Probation requirements differ from one person to the following and situation to situation and include:
Volunteering in the community
Fines Counseling
Term in prison
Submitting a statement to the probation officer
Reparations
Drug and alcohol prohibitions
Arms restrictions
Types of probation
After understanding what is probation, comes its types. The types of Probation are unsupervised Probation, supervised Probation, community supervision, shock probation, and crime-specific Probation.
Unsupervised probation
It is the Probation in which the inmate committed the minor crimes, and also it was his or her first crime. In this Probation, the inmate has not any supervisors.
Supervised probation
The prisoner must check in with his or her probation officer on a daily basis while being on supervised Probation.
Crime-specific probation
The drug addict and the person who is involved in humiliating the women have this crime-specific probation. It is also related to diversionary probation.
Diversionary services also have similar provisions to probation, such as courses, counseling, and community service. The offender will escape the stigma of getting a criminal record if he or she satisfies the criteria.
Community supervision
Community monitoring is a less intensive form of probation than regular supervision. While the offender stays in the community, he is continually monitored. You’ll likely be living under a curfew in your own home.
Shock Probation
Shock probation is given to those who commit the crime the very first time. In this probation, the inmate is afraid to live alone and the chance is that he loses his or her strength
How it becomes when one does not obey probation norms
The probation is only for the sake of the public. It’s a big mistake not to take probation seriously. The purpose of probation is to protect the community; if anyone violates a provision of their probation, the community might not be as protected as it should be. If anyone violates the terms of the probation, they must appear in front of the judge once more.
Source: The Law Team
Officer for probation service
When a person is on limited time probation, the state or agency has the probative services authority. It is the most critical aspect of it. The officer meets the person and keeps them up to date. Officer tries all his best work to keep on track of the criminal.
Taking charge of the person’s recovery
The officer also supports the criminal to get them back to their life after their probation.
They have to visit the home of the convict.
The officer is required to get the all-state agent document for the jurisdiction.
Officer also keeps the convict’s test that he or she is not using any kind of drug and alcohol during their probation time.
If they need any work and need, so the officer is also there to help out.
Conclusion
In the end, probation is basically a chance that is given to the guilty person. It is like a second chance to him or her because the court is not accepting any of the words by criminal, this law forces the opportunity to criminal that he or she can take some lesson and be a better person in the future.
The probation time has been passed so smoothly when the probation officer and the criminal both sacrifice and accept all the statements and the guidelines.

Alright, so from these search results, I've gathered that probation is a period where a person, usually someone who has been convicted of a crime, is released into the community under certain conditions and supervision. It's like a test period where the person has to prove that they can behave properly and follow the rules set by the court. If they do well, they might avoid stricter penalties like jail time. But if they mess up, they could be sent to prison or face other consequences.

So, thinking about the pros and cons of probation, I need to consider both the benefits and the drawbacks from different perspectives: the individual on probation, the victims, and society as a whole.

Let me start with the pros.

First, for the individual, probation can be a second chance. Instead of going to prison, which can be traumatic and disruptive to their life, family, and job, they get to stay in the community and try to turn their life around. This can be especially important for first-time offenders or those with minor offenses.

Second, probation can be less costly for taxpayers compared to incarceration. Prisons are expensive to run, and probation is generally cheaper since it involves supervision and sometimes treatment programs, but not the costs associated with housing and feeding inmates.

Third, probation can include rehabilitation efforts, like drug treatment, counseling, or education, which can help the individual address the underlying issues that led to their criminal behavior. This could reduce the chances of reoffending in the future.

Fourth, for victims, knowing that the offender is under supervision and has to follow certain rules can provide a sense of safety and closure. It shows that the justice system is taking steps to ensure that the offender is being held accountable.

Now, moving on to the cons.

One major con is that probation can be restrictive and burdensome for the individual. They have to follow strict rules and regulations, report regularly to a probation officer, and may have to submit to drug tests or other forms of monitoring. This loss of freedom can be difficult to handle.

Second, probation isn't always effective in preventing reoffending. Some studies suggest that recidivism rates are较高 among probationers, meaning that they end up committing more crimes after probation. This could be due to various factors, such as lack of proper support or treatment, or the individual not taking probation seriously.

Third, probation can be a drain on resources if not managed properly. Probation officers have to supervise multiple individuals, which can be time-consuming and require a lot of effort. If there aren't enough probation officers or resources allocated to supervision, it might lead to oversight or ineffective monitoring.

Fourth, some critics argue that probation is too lenient for certain types of offenses. For serious crimes, some people believe that incarceration is more appropriate to protect society and to mete out just punishment.

Lastly, there's the issue of revoking probation. If a probationer violates the terms of their probation, they might be sent to prison, sometimes for the original sentence they were avoiding. This can be seen as harsh, especially if the violation was minor.

Hmm, let me see if there's anything else.

From a societal perspective, probation can help reduce prison overcrowding, which is a big issue in many places. By keeping low-risk offenders out of prison, it frees up space for more dangerous criminals.

On the other hand, if probation fails and leads to more crime, it could undermine public safety. So, there's a balance to be struck there.

Also, probation can sometimes stigmatize individuals, making it harder for them to reintegrate into society. Employers might be hesitant to hire someone on probation, for example.

I should also consider the impact on victims. While probation might provide some reassurance, it could also be frustrating if the offender seems to be getting off lightly. Victims might feel that the punishment doesn't fit the crime, especially if the offender is allowed to remain in the community.

Moreover, there's the potential for probation officers to abuse their power or make mistakes in supervision, which could lead to injustices.

Let me think about international perspectives. Maybe probation works differently in other countries, and there are lessons to be learned from their systems.

Wait, but the question is about probation in general, so perhaps focusing on the US context is sufficient for now.

Overall, it seems that probation has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be a valuable tool for rehabilitation and crime prevention, but it also has limitations and potential pitfalls.

I should organize my thoughts better. Maybe make a list of pros and cons.

Pros of probation:

1. Second chance for individuals, especially first-time or low-level offenders.

2. Less costly than incarceration, saving taxpayer money.

3. Allows for rehabilitation through treatment and support programs.

4. Provides a sense of safety and closure for victims.

5. Helps reduce prison overcrowding.

Cons of probation:

1. Restrictive and burdensome for the individual.

2. May not effectively prevent reoffending in some cases.

3. Can be resource-intensive if not managed properly.

4. Perceived as too lenient for serious offenses.

5. Risk of probation revocation leading to incarceration.

6. Potential stigma affecting reintegration into society.

7. Possible frustration for victims who feel punishment is insufficient.

8. Risk of probation officer misconduct or errors.

I think that covers the main points. Now, depending on the specific context or type of probation, some of these pros and cons might weigh more heavily than others.

For example, in cases involving non-violent drug offenses, probation with treatment conditions might be highly beneficial. Whereas for violent crimes, some might argue that probation is inappropriate.

Also, the effectiveness of probation can depend on the quality of supervision and the availability of support services. If probation is coupled with comprehensive rehabilitation programs, it might be more successful in reducing recidivism.

Furthermore, there are different types of probation, such as supervised and unsupervised probation. Supervised probation involves regular check-ins with a probation officer, while unsupervised might have fewer requirements. Each type has its own set of pros and cons.

I should probably look into whether there are statistics or research that can support some of these points. For instance, what are the actual recidivism rates for probationers compared to those who serve prison time?

Incarceration vs. Probation: The Fine Print
By Bart Craytor
May 23, 2012
Many individuals believe that probation is not sufficient punishment for any offense.  They believe incarceration is the only answer as punishment for behavior which exposes a person to criminal charges.
Yet, probation, (also called community supervision), has been proven an effective punishment alternative to incarceration over the years.  One justification for probation is the savings to taxpayers as compared to incarceration.  Incarceration is costly to our government and citizen taxpayers.  Probation has costs associated with it as well, but it is usually a fraction of the cost of incarceration.
The Long Reach of American Corrections THE PEW CENTER ON THE STATES, 2009, cites figures of $79.00 per day for prison and $3.42 per day for probationers.  From such cost savings the need for community supervision can be justified as a viable alternative to prison.  A Texas study finds that prisons cost $44.01 per day and the daily cost of probation is only $2.13.  (2007 Texas Criminal Justice Solutions, TEXAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE COALITION, January 2007)
Other benefits to probation are found in the rehabilitative measures which probation can provide, while also maintaining public safety.  This can be better understood when one has a clear grasp of how probation is administered and the programs required by courts to successfully complete probation.  The primary goal of a probation officer is to protect the public.  A probation officer monitors the probationer's progress through frequent interaction with the probationer.  Employment status, random alcohol and drug testing, progress made toward paying fines and costs, completion of community service hours, and progress through special terms and conditions of probation as well as interaction of the probationer with law enforcement are some of the many areas reviewed by the probation officers.  While probationers are attempting to navigate through their term of community supervision, the probation officer has opportunities to identify other issues and problem areas that the probationer may be experiencing.  Areas such as mental health issues and substance addictions are often identified while a person is on probation.  Many times, it is these other areas which underlie the criminal behavior.  When such issues are identified, the court can order additional programs and requirements to rehabilitate the probationer and reduce the recidivism of probationers by immediate intervention which incarceration of the offender simply does not provide.
Probation is punishment.  Probation is not a "hug-a-thug" program.  It is more than a spanking, and beyond a second chance.  Probationers are more likely to pay toward their fines, fees, costs, restitution and less likely to re-offend after their release from probation according to the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition.  I have had clientele prefer prison than probation.  The conclusion is that some consider probation a more difficult sentence than prison or jail time.  It is the punishment aspect of probation, coupled with evidence based practices of rehabilitative programs which make probation successful.  Probation is not a compromise.  It is a consequence.  Probation officers are very serious about violations of the terms and conditions of probation and will bring such violations to the attention of the Court and the Prosecutor.  Many times a sanction is administered for violations, and sometimes the probationary terms are modified to include additional rehabilitative programs and training that the probationer will have to complete prior to discharge from probation.  Probation should be the first considered punishment option when compared to a prison sentence.
Prisons are simply warehouses for convicted.  They may protect the community while the person is incarcerated, but their effect on recidivism has been questioned.  A study published by The National Institute of Corrections at the U.S. Department of Justice study indicates that punishment alone actually increases recidivism.  Punishment when coupled with treatment and cognitive skills programs has a significant impact on recidivism.  While prisons and jails may manage recidivism, probation actually reduces recidivism.  When weighing the costs and benefits of probation as compared to prison, probation is clearly more cost effective means of punishment.  When it comes to long term protection of the community, probation wins again as a more effective program to reduce recidivism.  While not every case or defendant is a probation candidate, and prisons are necessary, they are not, and should not be, the only alternative punishment mechanism of our criminal justice system.

Probation and Parole 'Feed' Mass Incarceration: Report - The Crime Report
Probation and Parole ‘Feed’ Mass Incarceration: Report
By Andrea Cipriano |August 4, 2020
Art by Sally Deng / Human Rights Watch via HRW & ACLU report.
Probation and parole are often advertised as “alternatives to incarceration” that allow people to largely continue on with their life around a support group. However, a new report released late last week from the Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that probation and parole actually drive high numbers of people right back to jail or prison.
Many of these people are disproportionately Black and brown, and the authors say their return to a cell is largely due to the fact that they don’t get the services and resources they need.
Art by Sally Deng / Human Rights Watch via HRW & ACLU report.
“Probation and parole are seen as acts of leniency, but in the states we examined, they often lead to incarceration just for using drugs, failing to report a new address, or public order offenses like disorderly conduct,” said Allison Frankel, Aryeh Neier fellow at Human Rights Watch and the ACLU, and the report’s author.
“Incarcerating people for failing to meet the overly burdensome requirements of supervision upends peoples’ lives without meaningfully addressing their underlying needs.”
The data shows that over the past 50 years, the use of probation and parole in America has “skyrocketed” — parallel to increasing jail and prison populations. As of 2016, 4.5 million people, or 1 in every 55, were under supervision, often for years.
To better understand this problem, the authors did in-depth research on states where the problem is particularly acute — Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania — and interviewed 164 people directly impacted by the probation and parole system.
One man, Earnest Burgess, was convicted of drug possession in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 2011. After looking at his conditions of supervision document, he noticed certain conditions like “You shall not have in your possession at any time more than $100.00 in cash without agent’s approval,” felt onerous.
With more than 35 rules and conditions, Burgess said he wondered, “Are you trying to rehabilitate me, or are you trying to punish [me]?”
Researchers also spoke with a Black Pennsylvania woman who “cycled through probation and jail,” mostly for shoplifting and drug offenses, which she says “stemmed from a substance use disorder.”
“I asked for programs,” the woman told the researchers, “but [probation] didn’t want to hear that I need help; they just gave me time.”
The researchers also found that there are stark racial disparities in supervision, and its resulting punitive enforcement.
Nationwide in 2016, Pew Charitable Trusts reported that 1 in every 81 white people was under supervision, compared with 1 in every 23 Black people. They also found that Black Americans are more likely to be arrested and found in violation of their supervision terms compared to any other race or ethnicity.
Right Back Behind Bars
Because of the lack of resources, support programs, and countless rules to follow for probation and parole, many people are finding themselves right back in the cells they were in.
In 2017, 45 percent of all state prison admissions resulted from probation or parole violations, proving that this problem is pervasive in the system, the authors detail.
Art by Sally Deng / Human Rights Watch via HRW & ACLU report.
Nearly half of all prison admissions in Pennsylvania were for parole violations; and, over the last two decades, Wisconsin prisons have reincarcerated “about twice as many people for supervision violations as for regular criminal convictions.”
In Georgia, during a 5-month period in 2019, between 23 and 43 percent of all jail bookings in 9 counties involved probation or parole violations.
Because of the data, the problem the supervision-to-incarceration pipeline creates is clear, and it’s a systematic issue that must be addressed, the authors detail.
At their root, probation and parole violations “often stem from poverty; a failure by authorities to support people in addressing underlying challenges, such as substance use disorder, housing insecurity, or mental health conditions; and racially biased policing and enforcement.”
Because of this knowledge, the Human Rights Watch and the ACLU recommend that all federal, state, and local governments turn away from supervision and incarceration tactics for eligible individuals.
Instead, they suggest the governments invest in jobs and housing opportunities while encouraging voluntary treatment for substance use disorders and mental health care for those that need it.
This way, the authors write, you’re treating the criminality at its root, and ensuring that everyone is well equipped to enter back into their life.
“By investing in communities over supervision and confinement, governments can work to break the supervision-to-incarceration pipeline, and help people get the resources they need,” Frankel concluded.
Meanwhile in a separate report, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said the number of people on probation and parole has dropped to its lowest level since 1998.

Probation Effectiveness & Perceptions of Recidivism
As a citizen, a member of my community, and a taxpayer, I greatly admire the work that probation officers and other members of our corrections system do for our society.  However, I do not believe enough is being done.  Recidivism is “a person 's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime” (National Institute of Justice, 2014).  Recidivism is an important measure of program success.  The entire purpose of the corrections system is to prevent further crime by providing a punishment for past crimes and rehabilitation for criminal ways of living.  If the corrections system does not meet these goals, the recidivism rate will increase.  Thus, probation must be highly efficient in order to battle the recidivism rate.
As of 2014, the statistics on recidivism were unsettling.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a study pertaining to the recidivism rate of 404,638 prisoners in thirty American states (National Institute of Justice, 2014).  The study found that approximately two-thirds of the released prisoners were rearrested within three years after their release (National Institute of Justice, 2014).  This ratio increased to three-quarters of released prisoners within five years after their release (National Institute of Justice, 2014).  The majority of the study participants (more than fifty-six percent) were arrested within one year of their

Probation Is The Criminal Justice System
Question one
Probation is defined as ‘the conditional release of an offender into the community, under the supervision of a probation officer. ' The inclination made from this definition is that probation is not permanent and is revocable if certain conditions are not met as per the agreement between the criminal justice system and the offender (Schemalleger, 2009).
The rations for probation are usually four: allowing the offender to be part of the community’s reintegration services. It relies on

Full Report
Overview
Probation has been viewed traditionally as an alternative and solution to the problem of mass incarceration. However, as the number of people on probation has grown massively and probation supervision has become more punitive over the past few decades, recent reports have focused on how probation is actually contributing to mass incarceration.
But there is little information about probation’s impact on jail populations in particular. To remedy this, Vera obtained detailed data from nine cities and counties participating in the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s Safety and Justice Challenge (SJC), a national initiative that seeks to address over-incarceration by changing the way the United States thinks about and uses jails. This report explores how probation drives jail populations in racially disparate ways—through stringent and difficult to meet probation conditions that can result in revocation and through the detention of people awaiting violation hearings.

Key Takeaway
Probation has been considered an alternative to incarceration, but it has become more common and more punitive over time. It is increasingly a driving force in mass incarceration. By sentencing fewer people to probation, limiting the length of probation terms, and preventing probation violations, jail populations overall can decrease.
Publication Highlights
Increasingly large numbers of people are having their probation supervision revoked and are then being sentenced to incarceration.
Two SJC sites—St. Louis County, Missouri, and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania—reduced the number of people on probation in their jails by funding support services and providing for early termination.
There are pronounced racial disparities in the population of people held in jail for probation violations, with Black and Native American people disproportionately incarcerated.
Key Facts
In 2018, Black people were over 2.6x more likely than white people to be on probation.
In 2019, one in 73 adults in the United States was on probation.
Black people are 4.3x more likely to be admitted to prison for a probation revocation.

How Probation Supervision Contributes to Jail Populations - Safety and Justice Challenge
How Probation Supervision Contributes to Jail Populations
By: Alex Roth, Sandhya Kajeepeta
Jail Populations Probation Sanctions Racial Disparities October 28, 2021
Probation is the most common sentence in the United States. In 2019, one in 73 adults was on probation, and there were almost 1.5 million more people on probation than in jails and prisons combined. Although the problems of “mass supervision,” particularly the way probation violations contribute to state prison populations, have begun to draw greater critical attention, there is very little information about how probation contributes to local jail populations.
A new report released by the Vera Institute of Justice, with support from the Safety and Justice Challenge, focuses on the ways probation can affect jail populations and what can be done differently.
Research shows people are frequently sentenced to overly long terms of probation and have to comply with an average of 10 to 20 conditions, which are often vague and sometimes conflict with each other. The difficulty of complying with all of these conditions for long periods of time frequently leads to “technical” violations (violations of supervision conditions that are not based on new criminal conduct) and can lead to revocation of probation and imposition of a jail or prison sentence. Nationally, only around 60 percent of people under supervision complete probation successfully.
Probation is also marked by significant racial disparities. Despite being more likely to be sentenced to jail or prison than probation, Black people are still over 2.6 times more likely than white people to be on probation. When they are sentenced to probation, Black people tend to be given more conditions and to be on probation for longer terms than similarly situated white people. They are also more likely to have violations filed against them, to be sanctioned with incarceration, and to have probation revoked and be sentenced to incarceration.
There are multiple ways probation supervision can result in jail incarceration, such as detention of people waiting for court hearings on violations alleged by a probation officer or sentencing of people to jail for probation violations. There is some evidence that increasing numbers of people are choosing to accept a jail sentence up front to avoid probation, as they view probation as too difficult to comply with and likely to result in eventual incarceration anyway.
National data provides almost no details on how probation contributes to jail populations. To begin to remedy this gap, we analyzed jail data from nine jurisdictions participating in the Safety and Justice Challenge. This analysis showed admissions to jail for probation violations vary from a low of 3.9 percent to a high of 23.8 percent. The data also showed that length of stay (LOS) for people with probation violations was much longer than for those held in jail for other reasons. Because of this extended LOS, on any given day, the proportion of people in jail for probation violations greatly exceeded their share of jail admissions. The probation violation ADP ranged from 9.1 percent to just over 50 percent. Our analysis also confirmed significant racial disparities: across the sites for which race data was available, Black and Native American people were held in jail for probation violations at rates far higher than their representation in the general public.
We also highlight strategies in two SJC sites to reduce probation violation populations in jail. For example, St. Louis County placed three full-time probation staff members in their jail to meet right away with people who come in on violations and work on release plans and recommendations that can be delivered directly to judges. This has led to more judges ordering release based on a probation officer’s written recommendations rather than waiting to hold a preliminary hearing.
Allegheny County, meanwhile, adopted multiple strategies to try to prevent people from going to jail on probation detainers and to get those who are jailed released more quickly. A new policy makes probation detainers an option of last resort, as probation officers in most cases must exhaust all other options for keeping people in the community before issuing detainers, while also requiring earlier release planning and regular follow up for people who do get detained. Allegheny County also developed procedures to ensure that probation violations and new charges are resolved at the same hearing, rather than waiting an average of two months between separate hearings. Finally, the County adopted criteria for termination of probation agreed on by the public defender’s and district attorney’s offices, which led to judges ending probation early for more people who were doing well under supervision.
To better understand how probation affects jail populations, probation agencies and local jails should work together to combine data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, to ensure that they can determine who is in jail for probation violations; whether the violations are all technical or include new charges; whether people are being detained pending a violation hearing, serving a sentence as a direct sanction for a violation, or serving a previously imposed jail sentence after probation has been revoked; and how long people are spending in jail pending hearings and/or after being sentenced for violations.
Because probation can be a significant driver of jail populations, jurisdictions should work to reduce the number of people detained for violations as well as the time they stay in jail for those violations. Sites should consider using alternative non-carceral sentences instead of probation, limiting the length of probation, reducing and tailoring the number of probation conditions, reducing the frequency of reporting and allowing remote reporting, using summonses instead of warrants for violations, eliminating or severely restricting the use of detainers, and using only non-carceral sanctions for technical violations.

Okay, so from these search results, I've learned that probation can have both positive and negative impacts on recidivism rates. Some studies suggest that probation can be effective in reducing recidivism, especially when coupled with rehabilitative programs and support services. On the other hand, there are concerns that probation can also lead to higher recidivism rates if it's not managed properly or if it's too punitive.

In one report from Human Rights Watch and the ACLU, they argue that probation and parole often lead to incarceration for minor infractions or technical violations, which can actually increase recidivism. They suggest that investing in community-based support services and addressing underlying issues like substance abuse and mental health could be more effective in reducing recidivism than traditional probation methods.

Another study mentioned that probation can sometimes be more challenging for individuals than incarceration, leading some to prefer prison over probation. This suggests that the conditions of probation might be too burdensome, potentially leading to higher rates of violation and subsequent incarceration.

However, there are also examples where probation has been used effectively to reduce jail and prison populations. For instance, in St. Louis County and Allegheny County, they implemented strategies to reduce the number of people entering jail for probation violations by providing support services and allowing early termination of probation. These approaches seem to have had positive effects in reducing jail populations related to probation.

Moreover, there's a racial disparity in probation and parole supervision, with Black and Native American individuals being disproportionately affected. This raises concerns about equity and fairness in the justice system.

So, in summary, probation can be a double-edged sword. When used appropriately, with a focus on rehabilitation and support, it can help reduce recidivism and keep people out of prison. However, if it's too punitive and doesn't address the root causes of criminal behavior, it can actually contribute to higher recidivism rates.

I need to consider these aspects when listing the pros and cons of probation.

Pros of probation:

1. **Alternative to Incarceration:** Probation allows individuals to remain in the community, maintain employment, and stay connected with their families, which can be crucial for rehabilitation.

2. **Cost-Effective:** Probation is generally less expensive than incarceration, saving taxpayer money.

3. **Rehabilitation Opportunities:** Probation can include requirements for treatment, education, and counseling, which can address underlying issues contributing to criminal behavior.

4. **Reduced Jail and Prison Populations:** By keeping low-risk offenders out of prisons, probation helps alleviate overcrowding and allows resources to be directed towards higher-risk individuals.

5. **Second Chance:** Probation offers offenders a chance to demonstrate they can live law-abiding lives without the constraints of incarceration.

Cons of probation:

1. **Restrictive Conditions:** Probation comes with numerous rules and requirements that can be difficult to adhere to, leading to potential violations and incarceration.

2. **High Recidivism Rates:** Some studies indicate that probationers have high rates of reoffending, suggesting that probation may not effectively reduce future criminal behavior.

3. **Resource-Intensive:** Supervising probationers requires significant resources, including probation officers and support services, which may strain already limited budgets.

4. **Perceived Leniency:** For serious offenses, some may view probation as too lenient, failing to provide adequate punishment or deterrence.

5. **Racial Disparities:** There are concerns about racial bias in probation practices, with minority groups disproportionately affected.

6. **Potential for Revocation:** The threat of probation revocation and subsequent incarceration can create stress and instability for probationers and their families.

7. **Limited Impact on Underlying Issues:** Without proper support and treatment, probation may not adequately address the root causes of criminal behavior, leading to continued issues.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of probation can vary widely depending on how it's implemented and the support systems in place. Some probation programs that incorporate evidence-based practices have shown promising results in reducing recidivism, while others that rely heavily on punitive measures may not be as effective.

In conclusion, probation has both advantages and disadvantages, and its success likely depends on a balanced approach that includes appropriate supervision, access to necessary services, and fair and consistent enforcement of rules.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Probation has both pros and cons, including being an alternative to incarceration, cost-effective, offering rehabilitation opportunities, reducing jail populations, providing a second chance, but also having restrictive conditions, high recidivism rates, being resource-intensive, perceived leniency, racial disparities, potential for revocation, and limited impact on underlying issues.}} \]
