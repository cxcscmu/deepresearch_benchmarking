Alright, so I need to figure out what educators say about attachment in the school setting. First off, I need to understand what "attachment" means in this context. I think it's related to how students form emotional bonds with their teachers or peers, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.

the tendency of human infants and animals to become emotionally close to certain individuals and to be calm and soothed while in their presence. Human infants develop strong emotional bonds with a caregiver, particularly a parent, and attachment to their caregivers is a step toward establishing a feeling of security in the world. When fearful or anxious the infant is comforted by contact with their object. For humans, attachment also involves and affects the tendency in adulthood to seek emotionally supportive relationships.
ATTACHMENT: "A person who was soothed in the presence of a specific other person and felt calm around them, could be said to feel an attachment."

Abstract
Attachment influences students’ school success. This is true of students’ attachment to their parents, as well as to their teachers. Secure attachment is associated with higher grades and standardized test scores compared to insecure attachment. Secure attachment is also associated with greater emotional regulation, social competence, and willingness to take on challenges, and with lower levels of ADHD and delinquency, each of which in turn is associated with higher achievement. These effects tend to be stronger for high-risk students. In this era of accountability, enhancing teacher–student relationships is not merely an add-on, but rather is fundamental to raising achievement. Understanding the role of attachment in the classroom will help educators be more effective, particularly with challenging students. Twelve suggestions to improve teacher–student relationships and school bonding are provided.
Children’s socioemotional well-being is critical to school success, and attachment is the foundation of socioemotional well-being. Because of this, educators—from preschool to high school—can be more effective if they understand how attachment influences their students. Attachment influences school success through two routes: indirectly through attachment to parents, and directly through attachment to teachers and schools. In this article, we briefly review basic attachment concepts for readers who are not familiar with attachment research. We then show how attachment to parents is linked to school success, and we summarize the limited research on attachment-like relationships with teachers. Finally, we discuss school bonding and conclude with recommendations for educators.
Basic Attachment Concepts
Attachment is a deep and enduring affectionate bond that connects one person to another across time and space (Ainsworth 1973; Bowlby 1969 ). It is not synonymous with dependency; instead, secure attachment liberates children to explore their world. Attachment is also not synonymous with general sociability. Both outgoing and shy children can be securely attached.
Attachment relationships are characterized by specific behaviors in children, like showing preference for or retreating to the attachment figure when threatened or upset, and using the attachment figure as a secure base while exploring their world. Specific attachment behaviors in adults include attending to the needs of the child, responding to the child’s signals, and looking toward the child. Attachment behaviors show remarkable similarity across varied cultures. Most children direct attachment behavior toward more than one preferred person. However, children are highly selective about attachment figures, and so are likely to be attached to just a few (Ainsworth 1979 ). Usually children are attached to family (e.g., mother, father, and siblings), but they may also be attached to non-family (e.g., teachers or childcare providers).
Attachment has at least two functions pertinent to classrooms. (1) Attachment provides feelings of security, so that children can explore freely. While all children seek to feel secure, attachment helps them balance this need with their innate motivation to explore their environment. (2) Attachment forms the basis for socializing children. As children and adults are drawn together and interact harmoniously, children adopt the adults’ behavior and values.
Attachment is important across childhood, not just in toddlerhood. Toddlers’ attachment is obvious when they protest separation from their primary attachment figures (AFs). Older children may tolerate separation from their AF and may explore more widely because they do not need constant physical proximity to their AFs. However, they still need to feel secure. In middle childhood and adolescence, AFs’ availability remains important. Availability refers to physical presence, openness to communication, responsiveness to the child’s requests for help, and awareness of the child’s needs. Adolescence is a time of establishing autonomy and some independence from the family. Because some people confuse attachment with dependency, they mistakenly assume that attachment must wane during adolescence. Instead, self-reliance and independence are the result of feeling secure (Bretherton and Munholland 1999 ). A bedrock of healthy personality in adolescence is a belief in the availability of AFs.
Individual differences in attachment security
All children who are biologically normal attach to adults who take care of them, but the quality of attachment varies. Psychologists have identified four types of attachment using a variety of measures, such as the Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth et al. 1978) and the Adult Attachment Interview (Bretherton and Munholland 1999 ).
Secure
Secure children take an interest in novel surroundings when the AF is present. As toddlers they show a clear preference for the AF over others. If distressed, they readily go to the AF, are quickly soothed, and return rapidly to exploration. They show delight toward the AF (Ainsworth 1979 ). As older children they have a positive, open, engaged style of interaction with the AF (Behrens et al. 2007 ). They seek out the AF to help them cope with distress, and explore freely when they feel safe (Main and Cassidy 1988; Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). As teens they engage in productive problem-solving that allows them to preserve the relationship while asserting autonomy during disagreements with the AF (Allen and Land 1999; Allen et al. 2003 ).
What factors might lead to secure attachment? The AF’s sensitivity to the child is a core antecedent. A sensitive caregiver attends to the child’s signals, accurately interprets those signals, understands the child’s perspective, and responds promptly and appropriately to the child’s needs. For an infant, AFs might respond promptly and reliably to crying. For an older child, AFs might encourage, give assistance, instruct, or reassure the child during difficult tasks, and show interest in the child’s activities (Crittenden 1992; Pianta et al. 1989 ).
Other AF behaviors contribute to secure attachment as well (De Wolff and van IJzendoorn 1997; Pederson et al. 1998 ). These include high-quality communication that is open, direct, coherent, and fluent in attachment-related situations. AFs with secure children use warm, positive statements to direct their children and are less controlling, use less corporal punishment, and report more positive moods and enjoyment of their children than AFs with insecure children (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). AFs are accessible, cooperative, and accepting of their children. This constellation of behaviors is sometimes referred to as attunement, mutuality, synchrony, or insightfulness. Sensitive AFs and secure children respond to one another contingently, much as you would see in a well-synchronized dance. Insightful AFs consider the child’s motives and feelings, and take into consideration the child’s perspective in a child-focused way (Koren-Karie et al. 2002 ). High school students whose AFs are attuned to them are more likely to be securely attached than those whose AFs are not attuned (Allen et al. 2003 ).
Insecure/avoidant
Insecure/avoidant children appear very independent of their AF and display no clear preference for the AF. As toddlers they may turn away from the AF, appear deaf to the AF’s call, lean out of the AF’s arms, and keep their backs to the AF. As older children they do not seek contact when distressed, or communicate distress or vulnerability, and they avoid becoming emotionally close. They physically and emotionally avoid the AF (Behrens et al. 2007 ). As teens they may deny the personal impact of parent–child relationships, and may communicate dysfunctional levels of anger, but are also likely to avoid such discussions (Allen and Land 1999; Crittenden 1992; Hodges et al. 1999; Main and Cassidy 1988; Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ).
Children’s avoidant behavior makes sense because their AFs tend to be insensitive, intrusive, angry, and rejecting (Ainsworth 1979; Crittenden 1992 ). The AF may withdraw from helping the children with difficult tasks (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). The AF has been frequently unavailable when the children were in emotional turmoil. The children are left with conflict between their biological drive to contact the AF and anger toward the AF. Avoidant behavior is a defense against anger. The children suppress their negative emotions in the presence of the non-supportive AF, so that the AF will not reject or separate from them. This keeps the AF near in case they really need help (Ainsworth 1979 ). Thus, avoidant children exhibit cool indifference in order to maintain proximity with an adult who rebuffs them.
Insecure/resistant
Insecure/resistant children fail to derive feelings of security from the AF. As toddlers they have difficulty moving away from the AF to explore novel settings. They may show exaggerated emotions and are difficult to soothe. They seek contact, but do not appear to be comforted by it. They may be passive, whiney, fussy, helpless, or immature, or they may be angry, petulant, and resistant toward the AF. As older children they may also be demanding of and preoccupied with the AF (Behrens et al. 2007; Main 1999; Main and Cassidy 1988; Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). They may appear hyperactive as they drift from object to object. As teens they may express a strong need for their AF in stressful situations, have trouble separating, have excessive concern about the AF’s whereabouts, and have difficulty recovering from upset (Hodges et al. 1999 ). They may be angry with their AFs even while attempting to try to please them (Hesse 1999 ).
Resistant children may be responding to low levels of sensitivity in their AFs, who are unresponsive to all but the strongest signals from their children. AFs may seem dependent on the approval of their children. They may have difficulty allowing their children to direct their own play, often squabbling with children as though there were two children instead of an adult and child (Crittenden 1992 ). AFs often report feeling depressed, anxious, and dissatisfied with their marriages and home interactions (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). Their children are unsure of the AF’s ability or willingness to respond to them, but do not fear rejection. As a result, they may coerce the AF into constant availability by using angry threats, tantrums, pouting, sullenness, or other exaggerated displays of emotions or helplessness. Resistant children’s clingy, dependent behavior elicits caregiving from an AF who is inconsistently or inadequately responsive.
Insecure/disorganized-disoriented
Insecure/disorganized-disoriented children lack an organized response to the AF. As toddlers their attachment behaviors are contradictory. For example, they might approach the door when they hear mother returning, but then run to the other side of the room. They appear apprehensive, and their stress behaviors may actually intensify when they approach their AF. These behaviors are often fleeting and subtle. As older children they may take charge to an unnatural degree in order to reduce uncertainty and may appear confident, yet brittle and anxious (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). They may take on the parent role by behaving in a solicitous way toward the AF, or by trying to punish or embarrass the AF (Behrens et al. 2007; Main and Cassidy 1988 ). Their play may be characterized by violence and helplessness (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999 ). As teens they cannot discuss attachment coherently, or may express unresolved loss (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999 ).
Disorganized children may be responding to their AF’s incomprehensible or frightening behavior (Main 1999 ). Frightening behaviors include looming into the child’s face, approaching the child in an aggressive way, exhibiting trance-like behavior, showing fearful facial expressions, and handling the child as though the child were an inanimate object. Frightening behaviors put children in an inescapable conflict because the person they are drawn to for reassurance and security is also frightening (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999 ). Not all AFs of disorganized children are frightening; some are simply extremely insensitive (Bernier and Meins 2008; Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002 ). AFs of disorganized children often have a history of abuse, drug use, depression, or loss such as death or divorce (E. A. Carlson 1998 ). They are more likely to live without a partner, be intrusive and insensitive, and be psychologically unavailable, neglectful, or physically abusive. Many maltreated children have disorganized attachment (V. Carlson et al. 1989 ).
Child factors can also contribute to security of attachment. Children’s medical fragility or difficult temperament can make it more difficult for caregivers to develop secure attachment with them. However, children’s temperament makes only a small contribution to attachment security (Bokhorst et al. 2003; Vaughn and Bost 1999 ). Many “difficult” children become securely attached with sensitive parenting (Pauli-Pott et al. 2007; Vaughn and Bost 1999 ). Furthermore, randomized controlled experiments have found that interventions that improve parental sensitivity also improve attachment (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. 2003 ). Together, such research suggests that parent behavior drives the security of the relationship more than child behavior. About 50–60% of children are secure, another 20–25% are avoidant, and another 10–15% are resistant. About 10–25% are disorganized, but as many as 60% may be disorganized in high-risk samples (C. A. Bergin and McCullough 2009; O’Connor and McCartney 2007; van IJzendoorn et al. 1992 ). Children’s attachment type tends to be stable over time. However, when adults change in their responsiveness to children, security of attachment can change (Grossmann and Grossmann 1991; Howes et al. 1998b; Lewis et al. 2000; Weinfield et al. 2000 ).
Researchers disagree about whether these four types adequately describe the variation in attachment relationships (Fraley and Spieker 2003 ). Some research uses just two categories—secure vs. insecure—while other research uses a continuum of security in attachment. The research we will review in this article uses all of these typologies, but the most common is the 4-fold typology discussed above.
Decades of research have shown that security of attachment is linked to a remarkable array of child outcomes over long periods of time, including success at school. In general, disorganized children have the most negative outcomes, secure children have the best outcomes, and avoidant and resistant children are in-between. How might attachment affect child outcomes beyond the AF–child relationship? A widely accepted explanation is the development of internal working models, which are memories and expectations that children carry into new interactions with others, that influence whether children approach or avoid others, and that carry positive or hostile emotions (Bretherton and Munholland 1999 ). These models serve as filters for understanding current and future interactions, and help the child evaluate, predict, and choose behavior. They seem to become part of children’s internal personality by about age three (S. C. Johnson et al. 2007; Schore 2000 ).
Important components of internal working models include the following: (1) a model of others as trustworthy, (2) a model of the self as valuable, and (3) a model of the self as effective when interacting with others. Secure children create a model that the AF can be relied on to provide protection, security, and comfort (e.g., “I can count on her to help me—she is available and will help me get my emotions under control”). This becomes an expectation for the responsiveness of others in general, that others are caring and trustworthy, and that the social world is a safe place (Ainsworth 1979; Bowlby 1973; Sroufe 1996 ). In contrast, children who have a working model of the AF as inaccessible or unresponsive feel anxious.
Attachment to Parents is Linked to School Success
Security of attachment predicts academic achievement. This effect occurs as early as toddlerhood for pre-academic skills. Insecure toddlers tend to have shorter attention spans and perform worse on cognitive tasks than secure toddlers (Frankel and Bates 1990; Main 1983; Moss and St-Laurent 2001 ). While reading with their mothers, insecure toddlers are less inclined to stay on their mother’s lap and tend to be less attentive to the book. In contrast, secure toddlers tend to be more engaged during joint story-book reading (Bus and van IJzendoorn 1997 ). Secure preschoolers develop better reading or pre-reading skills and better attitudes toward reading than insecurely attached preschoolers (Bus et al. 1997; Bus and van IJzendoorn 1988a, b ).
After they enter school, insecure children tend to have lower verbal ability, math ability, reading comprehension, and overall academic achievement, and exhibit less curiosity than securely attached children (Granot and Mayseless 2001; Jacobsen and Hofmann 1997; Pianta and Harbers 1996; Weinfield et al. 1999 ). For example, one study found that attachment to mother and father predicted teacher ratings of school adaptation—like academic skills and emotional well-being—for third, fifth, and sixth graders (Kerns et al. 2000 ). In another study, attachment to mother predicted scholastic skill, GPA, and scholastic attitude among Israeli sixth graders, above and beyond the effects of IQ and self-esteem. This effect occurred for both concurrent attachment as well as for attachment measured 10 years earlier in infancy (Aviezer et al. 2002 ).
Insecure attachment in high school may also predict lower achievement during the first year in college. One study found that insecure students, compared to secure students, were more poorly prepared for exams, did not concentrate as well, feared failure, sought less help from teachers, and gave less priority to studies (Larose et al. 2005 ).
Why might parent–child attachment predict academic achievement? Possible answers come from one of the most well-known longitudinal studies of attachment, begun in Minneapolis in the 1970s with low-SES families (Sroufe et al. 1983 ). Attachment was assessed at 12 and 18 months of age. A few years later, the children’s preschool teachers rated insecure children as less curious, more dependent, less empathic, less compliant, lower in self-esteem, less emotionally positive, and less socially competent than secure children. Teachers interacted with insecure children less positively, and their peers liked them less.
At age 10, the same children were brought together for a 4-week summer camp (Shulman et al. 1994 ). During the camp, counselors again rated children who had been insecurely attached in infancy as less socially competent, less self-confident, less emotionally healthy, and more dependent compared with children with secure histories. They made fewer friends at camp and spent less time with friends. In addition, the insecure children were more likely to become friends with other insecure children. At age 15, the children attended a series of camp reunions (E. A. Carlson 1998 ). Again, infant attachment predicted social competence and independence. Psychopathology in teens was modestly predicted by insecure attachment in infancy.
Thus, the Minnesota study found that parent–child attachment was linked to several outcomes relevant to school success. These outcomes include (1) willingness to accept challenges and independence, (2) social competence, (3) emotion regulation, (4) ADHD behaviors, and (5) psychopathology and delinquency. These findings have been supported by later research, which we discuss next.
Accepting challenges and independence
In the Minnesota study, teachers rated insecure preschoolers as less persistent, enthusiastic, self-confident, and tolerant of frustration than secure children (Weinfield et al. 1999 ). At 15 years of age, they were more dependent. Similarly, in the Israeli study of sixth graders, teachers viewed insecure children as less able to work independently and cope with frustration or criticism (Aviezer et al. 2002 ).
Sroufe (1996) has argued that resistant attachment tends to result in children who are either easily frustrated, tense, and anxious, or dependent, passive, helpless, and preoccupied with the attachment figure. Avoidant attachment tends to result in children who are hostile or emotionally disconnected. This serves to keep people and feelings at a distance, which is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as “independence.” However, in the classroom, avoidant children actually seek more contact with their teachers than secure children, although they also are less likely to seek help when hurt or frustrated, and are more likely to be defiant. This elicits angry or controlling behavior from the teacher.
Social competence
Insecurely attached children are less likely to be socially competent throughout childhood than secure children. Insecure children tend to have poor quality friendships. For example, in one study, insecure 10 year olds had no good friends, or they reported having many friends but were unable to name one. They also reported being ridiculed or excluded by peers (Grossmann and Grossmann 1991 ). While being interviewed, they tended to ignore the interviewer or to be overly close, seeking physical contact.
Insecure children are also more likely than secure children to exhibit behavior problems. In one study, 71% of the cases of serious preschool aggression involved children with disorganized attachment histories (Lyons-Ruth et al. 1993 ). In another study, peers in fourth through eighth grade described insecure children as aggressive, argumentative, dishonest, disruptive, withdrawn, and anxious (Hodges et al. 1999 ). Avoidant and disorganized children are the most at risk for antisocial behavior in preschool and elementary school (Goldwyn et al. 2000; Granot and Mayseless 2001; Moss et al. 1998; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 2006 ). Still, many avoidant or disorganized children are not markedly hostile. Thus, backward prediction is clearer than forward prediction.
Cross-sectional studies indicate that secure children have more harmonious and intimate friendships, are more empathic toward peers, are more well-liked by peers, and are preferred playmates in preschool through first grade. They are described as more socially competent by preschool and high school teachers, as well as by peers in high school (Allen et al. 1998, 2007; Clark and Ladd 2000; Cohn 1990; DeMulder et al. 2000; LaFreniere et al. 1992; Weinfield et al. 1999 ). Even in college, secure freshmen report feeling more validated and cared for (Grabill and Kerns 2000) and have a larger, high-quality social support network (Anders and Tucker 2000 ).
The link between parent–child attachment and children’s social competence at school has been found from preschool to high school, and from low-risk to high-risk populations, although the effects may be strongest for low-income, minority children (Allen et al. 1998; Anan and Barnett 1999; Frankel and Bates 1990; Hodges et al. 1999; Troy and Sroufe 1987 ). Still, not all studies find an effect of attachment on peer social competence, and there is great variation in effect size. Pooling published studies, Schneider and colleagues (2001) concluded that there was an overall effect size of 0.20.
Social competence is foundational to academic achievement because schooling is a social endeavor. Across the school years, children who are prosocial tend to have higher grades and test scores than less prosocial children (Miles and Stipek 2006; Wentzel 1993 ). In contrast, antisocial and rejected children tend to have lower grades and test scores, more reading and learning disabilities, more attention and thought problems, and greater risk of dropping out (Bub et al. 2007; Buhs and Ladd 2001; Dishion et al. 1991; French and Conrad 2001; Horn and Packard 1985; Hymel et al. 2002; Ladd and Burgess 2001; Malecki and Elliot 2002; Trzesniewski et al. 2006; Wentzel 1993; Zettergren 2003 ). Antisocial children tend to spend less time on task in the classroom, exhibit poor academic skills, and complete less homework (Patterson et al. 1989 ). Antisocial children tend to have low achievement even when other risk factors such as low intelligence, single parent household, high absenteeism, unstimulating home environment, and low SES are statistically controlled (Masten et al. 2005; Prior et al. 1999; Wentzel 1993 ). Thus, attachment may affect children’s achievement at least in part through social competence at school.
What might explain the link between attachment and social competence? One mechanism is modeling. Parents of secure children model warmth, sensitivity, and positive emotions. Children who live with such parents learn to get along better with teachers and peers than children with insensitive parents (Stright et al. 2008 ). A second mechanism is through emotion regulation.
Emotional regulation
Attachment is the foundation of emotion regulation (Sroufe 1996 ). Insecure children lack experience with successful emotion regulation. As early as 4 months of age, children with insensitive mothers are poorly regulated compared to children with sensitive mothers (Braungart-Reiker et al. 2001 ). Caregivers of resistant children wait until upset has escalated to high levels before soothing. This trains children to have a rapid rise of intense emotions, makes them increasingly more difficult to soothe, and results in children who readily feel threatened, frustrated, anxious, and helpless (Thompson 1991 ). They under-regulate their emotions.
Caregivers of avoidant children are unresponsive, emotionally unavailable, or hostile. This trains children to rigidly squelch emotions and not seek others’ help, which limits their opportunity to learn more adaptive coping strategies (Cassidy 1994 ). They do not freely express emotions that make them vulnerable, they avoid emotional involvement with others, and they may become hostile, aggressive, and detached (Thompson et al. 1995 ). They over-regulate their emotions.
In contrast, secure children learn from their sensitive parents that when emotion is overwhelming, others are available to soothe them. They learn constructive coping strategies, feel comfortable communicating their emotions, are willing to take on emotionally challenging situations, and discuss “hot” topics without anger (Cassidy 1994; Kobak et al. 1993; Sroufe 1996 ). Secure children recover readily from distress without falling to pieces. Animal research shows that repeated experiences with a soothing caregiver alters brain circuitry, resulting in a brain that can appropriately dampen high arousal and regulate emotions (Cassidy 1994 ).
Emotion regulation, in turn, is foundational to the other important outcomes we have discussed thus far. For example, emotion regulation is foundational to accepting challenges at school. Because insecure children have fewer coping skills, they are unwilling to take on potentially frustrating tasks, less able to discuss emotional topics without anger, and respond negatively to novel situations at school (Kobak et al. 1993; Sroufe 1996 ).
Emotion regulation is also foundational to academic achievement. Insecure children may do poorly in school because they often feel anxiety, which interferes with learning (Gunnar et al. 1996; Hunsley 1987; Perry 1997 ). Learning is a result of engaging new, unfamiliar objects or information in a constructive way. Yet novelty causes emotional arousal. If the child does not have good emotion regulation, anxiety results and the child is not able to engage with novelty, or learn. Instead of attending to the goals that a teacher has set, anxious children attend to potential threats and their own safety. Children who are repeatedly exposed to anxiety early in life may be at risk for over-activation of the amygdala, which can lead to chronic problems with attention and thought (Blair 2001 ). Anxiety is also associated with compromised immune functioning and illness (Maier and Watkins 2000 ). Thus, anxious children may often be absent from school, which also interferes with achievement.
Finally, emotion regulation is foundational to social competence at school. Children who have poor emotion regulation are not as well-liked and are perceived as less socially competent by both teachers and peers (Eisenberg et al. 1995, 1997; McDowell et al. 2000 ). This is probably because children with poor emotion regulation typically express more negative than positive emotions, which leads to aggression and less prosocial behavior (Arsenio et al. 2000; Denham et al. 1990, 2003; Talley and Bergin 1998 ). In contrast, the smiles of happy children invite others to join them, and help sustain social interaction (Sroufe et al. 1984 ). In one study, first to fourth graders who expressed more positive than negative emotions at school were rated by teachers as more popular and well-behaved (Jones et al. 2002 ).
Healthy relationships require trust, self-disclosure, and reciprocity, so that true feelings can be shared. Secure children are free to be emotionally expressive (Sroufe 1996 ). Secure parent–child pairs can discuss past misbehavior with more emotional openness than insecure parent–child pairs (Laible and Thompson 2000 ). Secure children can express anger or say, “I hate you” to a parent, and still be confident that the parent will continue to care about them. Insecure children cannot. Their parents may not be able to contain their own negative emotions and may over-react, or they may dismiss their children’s feelings (e.g., “You can’t hate me. I’m your mother”). In self-defense, the child must shut off negative emotions so they are not overwhelming. Unfortunately, the strategies children use to protect themselves in insecure relationships can be carried over to prevent healthy future relationships with peers and teachers at school. As a result, insecure children tend to show ambivalence and contradiction in their relationships, a false self, emotional disturbance (withdrawal or aggression), fearfulness, or hyper-vigilance. Some are indiscriminant in their friendliness and attention seeking, and have difficulty forming close relationships.
Attention deficits and hyperactivity
Anxious attachment is linked to ADHD. Insecure children are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, or have ADHD symptoms regardless of being diagnosed (Clarke et al. 2002; Egeland et al. 1993 ). For example, a study of 5 to 7 year olds with disorganized attachment found they had social and attention problems according to their teachers (Goldwyn et al. 2000 ). This is presumably because anxiety impairs ability to control attention, executive functions, memory, and problem-solving, and increases task-irrelevant thoughts (Fincham et al. 1989; Ialongo et al. 1994 ). In contrast, secure children tend to have longer attention spans and higher cognitive test scores (Frankel and Bates 1990; Main 1983; Moss and St-Laurent 2001 ).
The link between attachment security and ADHD symptoms may be due to its effect on emotion regulation and anxiety. It may also be due to parents’ intrusiveness, which is a precursor to insecure attachment. Intrusiveness refers to parent behavior that directs the child’s activity according to the parent’s agenda without regard for the child’s agenda. Parents’ intrusiveness is associated with frustration, hyperactivity, and attention deficits in preschoolers, as well as academic and emotional problems in elementary children (Egeland et al. 1993 ). Parents’ intrusiveness in infancy is linked with ADHD behaviors 6 to 8 years later (Sroufe 1989, 1996 ).
Psychopathology and delinquency
Insecure attachment is not considered pathology per se, but is a risk factor for mental illness. Although most avoidant or resistant children do not develop clinically identified mental illness, according to some research 25–50% of disorganized children display significant problems by early elementary school (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999 ). In addition, compared to secure teens, insecure teens suffer greater rates of maladjustment, suicidal thoughts, depression, conduct disorders, substance abuse, and eating disorders (Allen and Land 1999; Hesse 1999; Lewis et al. 2000; Weinfield et al. 1999 ). Insecure attachment has also been linked to anxiety and social withdrawal (LaFreniere et al. 1992; Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999; Rubin and Lollis 1988 ). Delinquency and psychopathology take a toll on individual students and their peers and diminish the learning environment.
In summary, security of attachment is linked to academic achievement from preschool through high school. This link may be the result of attachment’s effect on many dimensions of children’s functioning—such as ability to take on academically challenging tasks, work independently, pay attention, tolerate frustration, be happy, contain aggression, be liked by peers, and have high-quality friendships—each of which, in turn, is linked to academic achievement. Figure 1 displays a model of relations among these variables. There is research to support each link in this model, although the full model has not been empirically tested. We present it as a framework to help educators understand how parent–child attachment may predict children’s academic achievement. Can this research be applied to children’s relationships with teachers?

Attachment to Teachers is Linked to School Success
To be effective, teachers must connect with and care for children with warmth, respect, and trust. It may be easier for teachers to establish attachment relationships in preschool or primary classrooms where teachers spend more time with students than in secondary schools, and tend to a broader range of their needs. Indeed, most of the research on teacher–student attachment has occurred in early childhood settings, rather than in secondary schools. Nevertheless, even in secondary schools both teachers and students believe that good teachers establish trusting, close relationships with students (Beishuizzen et al. 2001 ). Thus, we will discuss research pertinent to secondary schools, but by necessity emphasize early childhood. Later, we will discuss research on school bonding, which emphasizes secondary schools.
A preschool typology of teacher–child attachment
Researchers assessed attachment to early childhood teachers for 3,062 predominantly poor, European American and African American preschoolers (Howes and Ritchie 1999 ). They described four types of attachment to teachers that parallel the typology for parent–child attachment:
1.
Avoidant children were more interested in classroom materials than in the teacher or other children. They did not approach the teacher, so the teacher easily lost track of them. When the teacher approached, they acted as if they did not hear or notice the teacher. If requested to come to the teacher, they did so, but quickly left. They did not call out to the teacher to show something. When hurt or upset they did not seek the teacher, or even moved away if the teacher tried to comfort them.
2.
Resistant children were irritable and fussy with the teacher for no apparent reason. They often cried and were difficult to console. They resisted classroom routines like cleaning up. They clung to the teacher and cried if the teacher left the room. Every bump or scratch brought tears. They were easily frustrated by difficult tasks. They were demanding and impatient with the teacher and not satisfied with the teacher’s attempts to respond to them.
3.
Secure children accepted comfort if hurt or upset, molding their bodies to the teacher if held. They spontaneously hugged the teacher. They touched the teacher gently during play. They readily shared their activities with the teacher, showing things and welcoming entrance into play. They asked for help if they needed it. They read the teacher’s face for information. They easily followed directives, and acted sorry if the teacher spoke firmly to them. They made transitions smoothly. They were glad to see the teacher at the beginning of the day.
4.
Near secure children displayed moderate avoidant behaviors and some secure behaviors. They distrusted their teachers, but conformed readily to classroom procedures, such that teachers did not perceive a problem in their relationship. This category could be thought of as “attachment in the making.”
In a study of impoverished, predominantly African American 4 year olds, the same behaviors that characterize a secure mother–child attachment were characteristic of secure teacher–student relationships, such as keeping track of the other, using the adult as a secure base from which to explore, being comforted and reassured by the adult’s presence, and being attuned to the other’s facial expressions and emotions (Pianta et al. 1997 ).
An elementary school typology of teacher–child relationships
In elementary school, Pianta and colleagues distinguish between secure and dependent teacher–student relationships. A secure teacher–student relationship is “characterized by trust, feeling in tune with the student, and perceptions that the student feels safe with the teacher, the student would seek help, and the teacher could console the student” (Pianta and Nimetz 1991, p. 384). A dependent relationship is characterized by teacher perceptions that the student is “constantly seeking help or reassurance and reacting negatively to separation from the teacher” (Pianta and Nimetz 1991, p. 385). This is akin to Howes and Ritchie’s preschool typology of resistant teacher–student relationship.
Are teacher–child relationships attachment?
Not all positive relationships are attachment. Recall that attachment is a deep and enduring affectionate bond that connects one person to another across time and space. Children show preference for their attachment figure over other adults. They retreat to the AF when distressed and are readily soothed. The sensitive AF, in turn, attends to the needs of the child and responds to the child’s signals. Sensitive AFs make children feel secure, liberating them to explore their environment.
While some teacher–student relationships qualify as attachment relationships, some do not. In teacher–student relationships, it can be difficult to distinguish between extremely insecure attachment and non-attachment (Howes 1999 ). Non-attachment refers to how a child would relate to a casual acquaintance. Children have biologically innate propensities to attach to adults who spend time with them and who care for them. Thus, children, especially young children, may seek to form attachment relationships with teachers. However, some teachers and school structures promote non-attachment because they do not present the opportunity to attach. There is too little interaction between the teacher and a particular child. Other settings do present the child with the opportunity to attach, but the teacher is too unresponsive or insensitive for attachment to develop.
Many teacher–student relationships may fall between non-attachment and attachment because they have some, but not all, of the characteristics and fulfill some of the functions of an attachment relationship. Because the research we review is not limited to relationships that are clearly attachment, from this point forward we will use the term teacher–student relationships to acknowledge that while they are attachment-like, not all teacher–student relationships should be characterized as attachment.
Outcomes linked to teacher–student relationships
Preschool
Child outcomes linked to teacher–student relationships parallel those of attachment to parents. This has been found repeatedly at the preschool level. For example, Pianta and colleagues (1997) found that a positive teacher–student relationship predicted growth in language and conceptual knowledge. Howes and Ritchie (1999) found that teacher–student relationships predicted children’s social competence. Children with secure teacher–student relationships played in more complex ways with their peers. Resistant children had more difficulties with peers, and avoidant children were more hesitant to engage with peers. Teachers perceived the resistant children as more disturbed in classroom behavior than avoidant children, perhaps because the avoidant children kept away from teachers.
Elementary school
Similar effects have been found at the elementary level. In a study of several hundred first to fifth graders, emotionally warm, sensitive teachers had students with greater growth in math and reading ability (Pianta et al. 2008 ). In a study of 827 first-grade classrooms in 32 states, emotionally supportive teachers had students who were more likely to engage in academic activities, experience positive relations with peers, and avoid negative behaviors (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network 2002 ).
Other studies have found that children with close teacher–student relationships tend to perform well academically including having higher scores on achievement tests, more positive attitudes toward school, more engagement in the classroom, less retention in grade, and fewer referrals for special education (Birch and Ladd 1997; Hamre and Pianta 2001 ). Even children whose school readiness scores indicate a high risk for retention or special education referral are less likely to actually be retained or referred if they have a close teacher–student relationship in kindergarten (Pianta and Nimetz 1991 ). In contrast, children with a dependent teacher–student relationship—in which the child is possessive, clingy, and overly reliant on the teacher—tend to have adjustment problems like negative attitude toward school, poor academic performance, social withdrawal, and aggression.
Secondary school
It is more challenging to develop secure teacher–student relationships in secondary schools because children spend less time with a single teacher. Yet many adults can tell stories of secondary teachers whose caring had profound effects on them. In a recent book, The Ones We Remember (Pajares and Urdan 2008 ), educators reminisce about teachers who changed their lives. For example, Bergin (2008) wrote of a high school science teacher who influenced students’ career choices and life-long pursuit of hobbies, and whom students continued to visit many years after leaving high school.
Research confirms these anecdotal stories that teacher–student relationships are important to secondary students. In a study of high school students in rural Massachusetts, attachment to both parent and teacher contributed to student’s academic motivation and learning strategies, but the teacher–student relationship more strongly predicted classroom behavior (Learner and Kruger 1997 ). In another study, sixth to eighth graders who believed that their teacher cared about them were more motivated to try hard and pay attention in class, and earned higher grades (Wentzel 1997 ). In yet another study, Black youth were cooperative and engaged in the classrooms of teachers who focused on building trusting relationships with students; the same youth were suspended from another teacher’s classroom for defiance (Gregory and Ripski 2008 ). In a study of junior high students, poor teacher–student relationships in math classes were associated with children not valuing math (Eccles et al. 1993 ).
Secure teacher–student relationships may also protect children from antisocial behavior like aggression, drug and alcohol use, violence, and early sexual activity (Howes and Ritchie 1999; Howes et al. 1988; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 2002; Pianta et al. 1997 ). For example, in one study, youth who reported attachment-like relationships with their teachers were less likely to use drugs and alcohol, attempt suicide, engage in violence, or become sexually active at an early age (Resnick et al. 1997 ).
Longitudinal outcomes
Early teacher–student relationships may be particularly important because they predict long-term well-being in school. For example, a study in Texas found that positive teacher–student relationships in first grade were linked to engagement, effort, and attention in second grade and higher test scores in third grade among low-SES children (Hughes et al. 2008 ). In another study, a conflicted teacher–student relationship predicted reduced cooperative participation and school liking, and increased misconduct and attention problems, from fall of kindergarten to spring of first grade (Ladd and Burgess 2001 ). In a remarkable longitudinal study, an entire kindergarten population in a small city school district with a diverse population (35% African American) was followed through eighth grade (Hamre and Pianta 2001 ). A negative teacher–student relationship in kindergarten predicted lower grades, lower standardized test scores, and poorer work habits throughout elementary school, which in turn predicted lower academic achievement in eighth grade. This long-term outcome is noteworthy given that, by eighth grade, the children had transitioned through three school levels.
Early teacher–student relationships could have long-term outcomes because they influence subsequent relationships, perhaps because the quality of teacher–student relationships tends to be stable over time. For example, in the Ladd and Burgess (2001) study, teacher–student closeness and conflict were stable from fall of kindergarten to spring of first grade. In another study, 9 year olds’ perceptions of their relationship with their current elementary teacher were predicted by their relationship with their first teacher when they were toddlers or preschoolers in childcare (Howes et al. 1998a, b ). Perhaps they formed an internal working model of “teacher” as either positive or negative, and with each new teacher behaved in a way that was consistent with this model, thus eliciting similar patterns of interaction from the teachers. This is similar to parent–child attachment, which also tend to be stable across childhood.
The research on teacher–student relationships is correlational, so one cannot assume that a negative relationship caused later problems. It is plausible that early child behavior problems caused the negative relationship and/or later problems. Nevertheless, there is logical and theoretical support for causation from teacher–student relationship to school maladjustment.
In summary, evidence suggests that secure teacher–student relationships predict greater knowledge, higher test scores, greater academic motivation, and fewer retentions or special education referrals than insecure teacher–student relationships. In contrast, children who have conflicted relationships with teachers tend to like school less, experience less self-direction, and show lower levels of cooperation in classroom activities. This raises the important question of how teachers can develop more secure relationships with their students.
Antecedents of secure teacher–student relationships
The same antecedents of secure parent–child attachment predict secure teacher–student relationships. That is, secure relationships are more likely to develop when teachers are involved with, sensitive toward, and have frequent positive interactions with children (Howes and Hamilton 1992a; Howes and Smith 1995; Kontos et al. 1995; Whitebook et al. 1989 ). Ambivalent children tend to experience more teacher involvement and sensitivity than avoidant children, but less than secure children.
In addition, there may be some antecedents of secure relationships that are unique to classrooms. Teachers communicate caring for students by being well prepared for class, showing their “real” self, and holding high expectations for students (Davis 2003 ). Caring teachers also grant autonomy to students during classroom assignments. In a study of fourth and sixth graders, children reported feeling greater rapport with adults who were autonomy supporting rather than controlling (Gurland and Grolnick 2003 ). Autonomy support involved sensitivity to the child’s agenda and providing children with choice. In this study, both controlling and autonomy-supportive teachers were emotionally positive with the children, so simple positivity did not explain differences in rapport. Reeve and Jang (2006) found that teacher behaviors like allowing students to work in their own way, offering encouragement, and avoiding should/ought statements correlated with students’ perceptions of autonomy. An autonomy-supporting approach in the classroom is akin to the sensitive, non-intrusive care found in parents whose children are securely attached.
Similarity of attachment to parents and to teachers
Attachment is a relationship, not a trait inborn in children. That is, it is the result of many interactions between a specific adult and a specific child. Thus, children who are securely attached to a parent might not be securely attached to a teacher. Research confirms that there is not much relationship between attachment to parents and attachment to teachers in very young children (Howes and Hamilton 1992b ). In a study of White, middle-class preschoolers, only 45% of the children had the same security of attachment to mother and to childcare provider (Howes et al. 1988 ).
Among very young children, those with insecure parent–child attachment can develop a secure relationship with teachers. In the Howes et al. (1988) study, more children were securely attached to their caregiver than to their mother. In another study of infants in childcare in the Netherlands, where professional caregivers tend to be more sensitive than high-SES parents, half of the children who had an insecure relationship with both father and mother developed a secure relationship with the caregiver (Goossens and van IJzendoorn 1990 ).
Beyond infancy, however, children with insecure parent–child attachment are likely to develop insecure relationships with teachers (DeMulder et al. 2000 ). A possible reason why this pattern is not seen in younger children is that their internal models are still “in the making.”
Among school-age children, attachment history influences new attachment relationships. Unfortunately, the behavior of insecure children elicits responses in teachers that make it difficult to attach to them. Such behavior includes clinginess, hostility, helplessness, and disobedience. This may explain why children’s attachment to their parents affects the way teachers react to them (Pianta 1999; Sroufe 1996 ). Teachers interact with secure children in a warm manner and hold high standards for them to behave well. Teachers tend to interact with insecure children in a controlling manner, are less likely to expect compliance, and tend to use repeated directives. Teachers are more tolerant, nurturing, and controlling toward resistant children because teachers perceive them as immature and needy. Teachers tend to treat resistant children as though they were younger. Teachers are more likely to be angry and rejecting with avoidant children, and to isolate them because they defy adults and may hurt other children. Thus, teachers find it more difficult to develop a positive relationship with children who have insecure parent–child attachments.
Meeting the needs of insecure students
Recall that 1/3 to 1/2 of children have an insecure attachment with at least one parent. This means that insecure children are common in classrooms. Because teachers naturally react more negatively to insecure students, it is difficult for teachers to establish secure relationships with them. Howes and Ritchie (1999) found that children from difficult life circumstances can develop secure attachments to their preschool teachers, but less than 1/3 did so, suggesting that teachers do not readily develop a positive relationship with poor children who approach them with distrust or avoidance. Yet, a secure teacher–student relationship is an important protective factor for such children.
Fortunately, it is possible for insecure children to develop secure teacher–student relationships. Even in school-age children, both the child’s attachment history and the behavior of the current teacher contribute to the new relationship. If teachers are able to behave in ways that disconfirm the insecure child’s internal working models, then a secure relationship can develop between teacher and child. A caring teacher has to work to disconfirm insecure children’s expectation that the teacher will be hostile, rejecting, or unresponsive. This is important because children with insecure parent–child attachment who are able to develop a secure teacher–student relationship fare better socially, emotionally, and academically (O’Connor and McCartney 2007 ). For example, in a study of preschoolers, when the parent–child relationship was insecure, secure attachment to the teacher seemed to partially compensate because the children were more prosocial and emotionally positive than children with an insecure relationship to both parent and teacher (Mitchell-Copeland et al. 1997 ).
Children vary in how much they need to attach to teachers. Children who have secure attachment to parents are not likely to need an additional secure adult–child relationship, yet they are easier for teachers to attach to. In contrast, maltreated children have a special need for attachment to teachers, and may be particularly prone to seek psychological proximity to teachers, yet they are more difficult for teachers to like and support. In one study of 7- to 13-year-old maltreated children, the children were significantly more likely to wish that their teacher paid more attention to them than non-maltreated children. Children who wished that they were closer to their mothers also wished they were closer to their teachers (Lynch and Cicchetti 1992 ). In addition to having attachment-like relationships with teachers, children can feel attachment toward their school, our next topic.
School Bonding
School bonding refers to a sense of belonging at school and having a network of relationships with peers and teachers. School bonding is akin to attachment in that it can make children feel secure and valued, which can liberate them to take on intellectual and social challenges and explore new ideas. A child who is bonded to school has a sense that “people at school like me.” A child who is not bonded to school feels lonely, outcast, and alienated. In one study of a school of 1,500, students with no school bonding said “I don’t have any friends at school,” or “No one wants to talk to me at school” (Mouton et al. 1996 ). They reported not knowing the principal at all, and disliking all of the teachers except possibly one. They felt their teachers did not know or like them and treated them unfairly. They felt that teachers did not notice when they missed school, and did not want them to do well.
Both classrooms and schools can vary in socioemotional “climate,” or how valued they make students feel. The climate of a classroom is affected by the teacher–student relationship and how much a teacher enjoys students, although the particular composition of the students can make a large difference as well (Marsh et al. 2008 ). In secondary schools, how “students feel about school and their coursework is in large measure determined by the quality of the relationship they have with their teachers in specific classes” (Osterman 2000, p. 344). If students perceive their teachers as supportive and feel secure in teacher–student relationships, they have greater interest and engagement in school, which is related to achievement and grades. Clearly, teacher–student relationships are an important component of school bonding.
Participation in extracurricular activities is another important component of school bonding. High school students feel more connected to school when there is a high rate of participation in extracurricular activities in addition to a positive classroom climate (McNeely et al. 2002 ). In one study, participation in extracurricular activities at middle school prevented early school dropout (Mahoney and Cairns 1997 ). The least competent students benefited the most, even though their involvement was often a single extracurricular activity. This raises serious concerns about making extracurricular activities exclusionary. Many extracurricular activities require expertise before a child can participate (e.g., sports, music, quiz bowl, etc.) or require selection/election. Some activities require a certain GPA, even though grades have nothing to do with the activity. Such policies preclude some children—probably those who need it most—from participation and the opportunity to “belong” at school.
Children report being happier and more motivated during extracurricular activities than while in class (Mahoney et al. 2006 ). Extracurricular activities are freely chosen and provide greater opportunity for establishing relationships with peers and coaches or teachers than do most classroom activities.
Identification with school, belongingness, and positive relationships with teachers are associated with lower levels of dropping out of school (Christenson and Thurlow 2004 ). Effective programs for school completion focus, at least in part, on building students’ relationships within the school. School bonding is also linked to less depression in adolescents (Jacobson and Rowe 1999 ).
School bonding influences achievement. A study of kindergartners found that children who liked school participated in class more, which led to higher achievement (Ladd et al. 2000 ). In a study of low-income African American and Hispanic children, overall school climate—which leads to school bonding—predicted reading and math achievement scores in first grade and school adjustment in second grade (Esposito 2000 ). The positive effects of school bonding may be strongest in high poverty schools and for high-risk youth (Osterman 2000; Resnick et al. 1997 ).
School bonding is particularly important in middle schools (Osterman 2000 ), yet elementary schools are more likely to meet children’s need for belongingness. Indeed, as children transition from elementary to junior high or middle school, and then again to high school they become more negative about school. These transitions are linked to a decline in grades, self-confidence, school interest, and extracurricular involvement (Juvonen 2007 ). The decline is not extreme for most children. It may be worse for children experiencing other changes such as moving or a divorce (Burchinal et al. 2008; Simmons and Blyth 1987; Zanobini and Usai 2002 ). With each transition, children must adjust to new teachers, new class structure, and a new mix of peers.
Why is there increased negativity in secondary schools? Too often attributes of the children, such as so-called raging hormones, are mistakenly blamed for school negativity, but the real problem may be that secondary schools are not designed for belongingness. Eccles and colleagues investigated the transition from elementary school to junior high school, from grade 6 to grade 7 (Eccles et al. 1993 ). They found a poor fit between the needs of children at this age and school structure. Junior highs are structured differently from elementary schools in several ways. Two key differences that interfere with school bonding are:
1.
There is more emphasis on teacher control and discipline with less emphasis on student choice and self-management. Teachers spend less time teaching, and more time maintaining order. Yet, at this age, children seek more autonomy.
2.
Teacher–student relationships are less personal and positive. Children see teachers as less friendly and teachers see children as less trustworthy, compared with the same children’s relationships with their elementary teachers just 1 year earlier.
Children in K-8 programs, who do not make as many transitions, fare better than those who make more transitions. Simmons and Blyth (1987) followed 621 children in Milwaukee from sixth to tenth grade. Some children attended elementary school until sixth grade, junior high for 3 years, and high school for 3 years. Others attended elementary until eighth grade, and high school for 4 years. Those who had to transition to the junior high were more negative toward school, were less involved in extracurricular activities, had lower math achievement, lower grades, lower self-esteem (girls only), and were more victimized (boys only) than their same-age peers who did not make the transition. There were more negative reactions when they transitioned yet again from the junior high to the senior high, particularly in self-esteem and extracurricular participation.
A decrease in school bonding as children move from elementary to secondary school is not inevitable. International comparisons of 11 to 15 year olds find that U.S. secondary students feel markedly less bonded and dislike school more than in some other countries (Juvonen 2007 ). Whether students bond to a school depends on whether the structure of the school presents opportunities for meeting attachment needs. We address ways to do this in the next section.
Recommendations
To feel securely connected to others is a basic human need (Baumeister and Leary 1995 ). Ideally, this need is met at school as well as at home. While attachment research has altered other major institutions such as hospitals for the better, it has not influenced schools sufficiently. One study found that about 25% of children in the upper elementary grades perceive school as an uncaring place (Watson et al. 1997 ). Clearly there is room for improvement. We recommend several approaches to promoting attachment-like relationships with teachers and school bonding. Some simply require individual teachers to behave in specific ways with children, but others may require programmatic or even structural changes in schools. We will begin with individual teachers.
Individual teachers
A teacher’s relationship with each child is important for raising achievement levels as well as for improving socioemotional well-being. Teachers need to learn how to deal constructively with children who have insecure attachment to parents. It is a challenge not to act in ways that confirm insecure children’s working models. Insecure children seek positive, warm, trusting relationships, but do not have the skills to create them. This means it is up to the teacher to change children’s views of relationships and meet their socioemotional needs. Based on the research summarized above, we make six recommendations for how teachers can improve their relationships with students and foster school bonding:
1.
Increase sensitivity and warm, positive interactions with students. Teacher sensitivity refers to accurate detection and interpretation of children’s cues, provision of comfort, and responsiveness to distress (Pianta et al. 2008 ). One way teachers become more sensitive to children is to increase their knowledge of child development. Teachers who know more about child development are more sensitive in their interactions with children (Howes et al. 1988; Whitebook et al. 1989 ). Unfortunately, many colleges of education give too little time to child development coursework.
2.
Be well prepared for class and hold high expectations for students. This is one way that teachers show they care about student achievement, in addition to increasing sensitivity and being responsive (Davis 2003 ). Wentzel (1997) found that middle-school students felt their teachers cared for them if they helped each student academically, like asking if they needed help, calling on them, making sure they understood content, teaching in a special way, and making class interesting. Non-caring teachers got off task, taught while students were not paying attention, and did not answer questions or explain things.
3.
Be responsive to students’ agendas by providing choice whenever possible. This may help students feel greater rapport with teachers. Note that choice may be less important for students from collectivist cultures than those from individualist cultures (Iyengar and Lepper 2000; Katz and Assor 2007 ).
4.
Use induction rather than coercive discipline. Induction involves explaining the reason for rules and pointing out the consequences of breaking rules. Coercive discipline involves using threats, imposing the teacher’s superior power, and taking advantage of the teacher’s ability to control resources like recess time, grades, or detentions. Coercion interferes with caring relationships (Noddings 1992 ). High school students are more likely to feel school bonding if their school does not have harsh discipline policies, like expelling students for relatively minor infractions (McNeely et al. 2002 ). Children who are disciplined with induction—particularly victim-centered induction in which the adult points out how the child’s behavior has made someone else feel—are likely to become prosocial and emotionally positive (C. Bergin 1987; Krevans and Gibbs 1996; Paulussen-Hoogeboom et al. 2007 ). Unfortunately, even though teachers find discipline to be a pervasive problem, less than 1% of peer-reviewed articles in elementary education journals over a 10-year period addressed the issue of how to effectively discipline (Hardman and Smith 2003 ). While there are many approaches to classroom discipline, few have been evaluated using good science. Readers are referred to Bergin and Bergin (1999) who discuss how to implement non-coercive discipline from a sound theoretical and research basis. They point out that effective discipline achieves compliance, but by using the least possible power and by keeping the emotional tone positive and respectful. Teachers can do this by using reasoned persuasion, rather than coercion.
5.
Help students be kind, helpful, and accepting of one another. Peer culture is a key component of school bonding (Juvonen 2007 ). Students tend to feel greater school bonding if peers get along with each other (McNeely et al. 2002 ). One program, the Child Development Project, effectively promotes prosocial behavior through building a strong sense of community in the school and creating a caring classroom climate where teachers are warm, use inductive discipline, encourage cooperation among students, and use an authoritative teaching style (Schaps et al. 2004 ). Teachers can also help children become more prosocial by providing children with opportunities to care for and help each other (Mussen and Eisenberg 2001; Noddings 1992 ). Teachers can increase prosocial behavior through modeling, such as complimenting students, respecting students, and avoiding hurting their feelings (Wentzel 1997 ). Teachers can increase prosocial behavior by praising and expressing gratitude for kindnesses, such as “ you are a nice person ” or “ I really appreciate that you took the trouble to do that ” (Bartlett and DeSteno 2006; McCullough et al. 2008; Mills and Grusec 1989; Mussen and Eisenberg 2001 ).
6.
Implement interventions for specific, difficult relationships. Pianta (1999) describes an intervention he refers to as “banking time” because the teacher “saves up” positive experiences in relationship “capital” that can later be “drawn upon.” For 5 to 15 min each day, the teacher gives the child undivided attention and follows the child’s lead in whatever activity the child chooses. During these few minutes, the teacher does not do any teaching, directing, or reinforcing, but rather acts as a sportscaster, simply giving a play-by-play narrative of the child’s actions. The teacher conveys acceptance, interest, and safety to the child. This approach helps repair relationships where there are high levels of conflict and the adult has been controlling and dominating with the child. Relationship repair takes time, because insecure children have expectations that adults are negative, unsafe, and untrustworthy. The school psychologist or counselors should be able to help teachers repair a difficult relationship with a specific child.
School-wide policies
The six approaches described above can be implemented by individual teachers within the confines of their own classrooms, regardless of the larger school context. However, some school policies and procedures can facilitate, or undermine, teacher–student relationships and school bonding. We make six additional recommendations for improving school-wide policies:
1.
Implement school-wide interventions. In schools with high-risk populations, teacher–student relationships can be improved throughout the school. For example, in a therapeutic preschool where most children had been expelled from other preschools for misbehavior, teachers focused on being consistently positive in order to disconfirm children’s internal models of adults as inconsistent, neglectful, or harsh. Very few of the children were securely attached to their teachers, but over time some became more secure (Howes and Ritchie 1998 ). Those who made the most progress were those who had initially been the most insecure.
2.
Provide a variety of extracurricular activities that are accessible to students. High school students feel more connected when there is a high rate of participation in extracurricular activities (McNeely et al. 2002 ). Many high schools make participation expensive in a way that limits accessibility (e.g., Bettis and Adams 2003 ).
3.
Keep schools small. A nationally representative study of 75,000 seventh to twelfth graders found that students feel more connected to their schools if the school is small (McNeely et al. 2002 ). The optimal size for bonding was about 300; however, the optimal size for academic curriculum may be larger. Some secondary schools are able to partially mimic the positive effects of smaller schools by creating “schools-within-a-school,” which may also be called teams, pods, or learning communities (Felner et al. 2007 ). In contrast to school size, class size may not affect school bonding (McNeely et al. 2002 ). In fact, classrooms that are too small can result in children not having enough opportunity to find a peer buddy.
4.
Provide continuity of people and place. Attachment takes time to develop. This requires that teachers and students stay together long enough to form relationships. In a preschool that emphasized relationships by having teachers move with children to older classrooms, researchers found that it took at least 9 months with an expert teacher before the children developed secure teacher–student relationships (Raikes 1993 ). This is probably an underestimate of the time needed for high-risk children, older children, or children with insecure attachment histories to establish secure relationships. In a childcare setting for homeless children in New York, attachment to teachers took from several months to a few years, even though bonding was given priority, and one-on-one time was regularly scheduled between teacher and child (Ansbach and Epstein 2000 ). Thus, we might not expect bonding to occur until the end of a typical school year, when relationships are normally ended. This situation could be improved in three ways:
(a)
Keep students together so peer groups are stable. Some secondary schools attempt to do this by having teams of children attend multiple classes together.
(b)
Keep children in the same building for several years. Some communities locate kindergarten and preschools for high-risk children for the entire district in a single central location that is different from where they will attend elementary school. This means that as children advance in grade, they cannot drop in on their previous teachers. Some school districts have too many levels of schools—elementary, middle, junior high, and senior high—so that children only spend a few years at each building. This undermines school bonding.
(c)
Keep children with the same teacher or team of teachers for multiple years. For example, in Sweden, teachers have the same students for grades 5–8 (Kerr and Stattin 2000 ). Pianta (1999) taught the same middle school children for multiple years and found that classroom management problems decreased, motivation for difficult academic tasks increased, and performance increased because he was able to develop relationships with children. Too few American schools do this. Even in high school, where it is theoretically possible to teach the same child for multiple years, teachers’ course assignments sometimes keep this from happening. A child who takes math or a foreign language for 4 years might have a different teacher each year because one teacher is assigned to freshmen and another teacher is assigned to advanced students.
5.
Facilitate transitions to new schools or teachers. If children must move from one school to another, they should be helped to make connections with children, families, and teachers as they transition. Two procedures that help are to place new students with the same teacher their older siblings had and to place children with friends. Other procedures might include hosting informal family nights with teachers at the school, hosting school visits in the spring for children who will enter the new school in the fall, and assigning an older student as a “buddy” to show the new student around.
6.
Decrease transitions in and out of the classroom. In a single day, an elementary child may go to a speech therapist, reading specialist, and counselor or other specialist. When this coming and going is combined with the other teachers the child experiences such as gym, music, art, and science, there are too many transitions. Ironically, high-risk children who have difficulty adapting to the classroom and most need stability tend to spend the most time coming and going from the classroom. When there are several transitioning children in a classroom, it can be disruptive to the students. When services are delivered by many different specialists to high-risk children, their risk may actually increase (Pianta 1999 ). Such a structure is designed to meet the academic needs of children, but disregards their socioemotional needs. One possible solution is to have specialists serve as in-classroom consultants to teachers, so that children stay in the classroom. Some high schools attempt to eliminate classroom transitions for high-risk adolescents with a “school within a school” approach, but this may be too late for children disenfranchised from school.

Conclusions
Nel Noddings (1992) argues that the first job of schools is to care for children. It is morally and practically wrong to assert that schools should only concentrate on academic goals; children do not learn academically if they are not cared for. All students want to learn, although not necessarily the content they are asked to learn in school. Caring for children prepares them to be receptive to learning such content. Children should feel safe in their relationships with their teachers—they should be able to admit confusion, errors, and even a dislike of the subject matter. Teachers should care for students even if they are not interested in the subject the teacher is passionate about. Of course, teachers are more attracted to children who share their passions for a topic, but all children, even those with interests different from the teacher’s, must be valued and cared for. Noddings suggests that teachers should avoid pernicious gossip about children in the lounge, know where their students live, join them for lunch, and chat with them. She points out that while families use mealtime as an important arena for relationship building, teachers seldom do.
Positive teacher–student relationships may be particularly important for children at the bottom of the achievement gap. Several of the studies reviewed above found that positive effects were strongest for low-SES, low-achieving, and African American children. For example, in the Hamre and Pianta (2001) longitudinal study, relationship problems with their kindergarten teacher predicted maladjustment in junior high most strongly for boys, African Americans, children with poor verbal ability, and children with initial behavior problems. Vulnerable children who developed positive relationships with teachers were less likely to develop later behavior problems at school. It may be more challenging for teachers to establish secure relationships with low-SES children because low SES is related to insecure parent–child attachment (e.g., NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 1997 ). Disorganized attachment is almost twice as prevalent in low-SES than middle-SES children (Lyons-Ruth et al. 1990 ). Perhaps this is because low SES is linked to a series of risk factors such as low education, increased drug use, and lack of support from the father, which are linked with less sensitive parenting (Tarabulsy et al. 2005 ). Yet, secure attachment occurs in spite of poverty when parents are warm and accepting, not intrusive, and do not use physical punishment (Barnett et al. 1998 ).
Establishing school bonding may be especially challenging for students who are in the ethnic minority at their school. Adolescents tend to feel more attached to school when a high proportion of students are their same ethnicity (M. K. Johnson et al. 2001 ). However, ethnically segregated schools are not ideal for many reasons, including inequality of education, so multi-ethnic schools may need to put forth special effort to ensure that all students feel they belong.
Secure teacher–student relationships may seem like a low priority in an era of high stakes testing. However, children’s socioemotional well-being is linked to achievement. Higher quality education is the result of healthy relationships from preschool to high school. In a study of preschoolers, teacher–student interaction was more predictive of academic, language, and social skill development than other aspects of the preschool setting, such as teacher–student ratio, curriculum, class size, and physical environment (Mashburn et al. 2008 ). Among school-age children, the effect size of teacher–student relationships is large, larger than typical educational innovations or curriculum changes (Cornelius-White 2007 ). This suggests that improving teacher–student relationships could be a particularly powerful way to improve achievement, particularly for at-risk groups. Most of our recommendations are low cost because they simply require improved relationships with children, rather than new curriculum or infrastructure. More importantly, promoting attachment-like teacher–student relationships and school bonding should be given priority because it promotes children’s well-being.

Abstract Attachment influences students school success. This is true of students attachment
to their parents, as well as to their teachers. Secure attachment is associated with higher grades
and standardized test scores compared to insecure attachment. Secure attachment is also
associated with greater emotional regulation, social competence, and willingness to take on
challenges, and with lower levels of ADHD and delinquency, each of which in turn is
associated with higher achievement. These effects tend to be stronger for high-risk students. In
this era of accountability, enhancing teacherstudent relationships is not merely an add-on, but
rather is fundamental to raising achievement. Understanding the role of attachment in the
classroom will help educators be more effective, particularly with challenging students.
Twelve suggestions to improve teacherstudent relationships and school bonding are provided.

Childrens socioemotional well-being is critical to school success, and attachment is the
foundation of socioemotional well-being. Because of this, educatorsfrom preschool to
high schoolcan be more effective if they understand how attachment influences their
students. Attachment influences school success through two routes: indirectly through
attachment to parents, and directly through attachment to teachers and schools. In this
article, we briefly review basic attachment concepts for readers who are not familiar with
attachment research. We then show how attachment to parents is linked to school success,
and we summarize the limited research on attachment-like relationships with teachers.
Finally, we discuss school bonding and conclude with recommendations for educators.

Basic Attachment Concepts
Attachment is a deep and enduring affectionate bond that connects one person to another
across time and space (Ainsworth 1973; Bowlby 1969). It is not synonymous with
dependency; instead, secure attachment liberates children to explore their world.
Attachment is also not synonymous with general sociability. Both outgoing and shy
children can be securely attached.
Attachment relationships are characterized by specific behaviors in children, like
showing preference for or retreating to the attachment figure when threatened or upset, and
using the attachment figure as a secure base while exploring their world. Specific
attachment behaviors in adults include attending to the needs of the child, responding to the
childs signals, and looking toward the child. Attachment behaviors show remarkable
similarity across varied cultures. Most children direct attachment behavior toward more
than one preferred person. However, children are highly selective about attachment figures,
and so are likely to be attached to just a few (Ainsworth 1979). Usually children are
attached to family (e.g., mother, father, and siblings), but they may also be attached to nonfamily (e.g., teachers or childcare providers).
Attachment has at least two functions pertinent to classrooms. (1) Attachment provides
feelings of security, so that children can explore freely. While all children seek to feel secure,
attachment helps them balance this need with their innate motivation to explore their
environment. (2) Attachment forms the basis for socializing children. As children and adults
are drawn together and interact harmoniously, children adopt the adults behavior and values.
Attachment is important across childhood, not just in toddlerhood. Toddlers attachment is
obvious when they protest separation from their primary attachment figures (AFs). Older
children may tolerate separation from their AF and may explore more widely because they do
not need constant physical proximity to their AFs. However, they still need to feel secure. In
middle childhood and adolescence, AFs availability remains important. Availability refers to
physical presence, openness to communication, responsiveness to the childs requests for help,
and awareness of the childs needs. Adolescence is a time of establishing autonomy and some
independence from the family. Because some people confuse attachment with dependency,
they mistakenly assume that attachment must wane during adolescence. Instead, self-reliance
and independence are the result of feeling secure (Bretherton and Munholland 1999). A
bedrock of healthy personality in adolescence is a belief in the availability of AFs.
Individual differences in attachment security
All children who are biologically normal attach to adults who take care of them, but the
quality of attachment varies. Psychologists have identified four types of attachment using a
variety of measures, such as the Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth et al. 1978) and
the Adult Attachment Interview (Bretherton and Munholland 1999).
Secure
Secure children take an interest in novel surroundings when the AF is present. As toddlers
they show a clear preference for the AF over others. If distressed, they readily go to the AF,
are quickly soothed, and return rapidly to exploration. They show delight toward the AF
(Ainsworth 1979). As older children they have a positive, open, engaged style of interaction
with the AF (Behrens et al. 2007). They seek out the AF to help them cope with distress,
and explore freely when they feel safe (Main and Cassidy 1988; Stevenson-Hinde and
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
143
Verschueren 2002). As teens they engage in productive problem-solving that allows them to
preserve the relationship while asserting autonomy during disagreements with the AF
(Allen and Land 1999; Allen et al. 2003).
What factors might lead to secure attachment? The AFs sensitivity to the child is a core
antecedent. A sensitive caregiver attends to the childs signals, accurately interprets those
signals, understands the childs perspective, and responds promptly and appropriately to the
childs needs. For an infant, AFs might respond promptly and reliably to crying. For an older
child, AFs might encourage, give assistance, instruct, or reassure the child during difficult
tasks, and show interest in the childs activities (Crittenden 1992; Pianta et al. 1989).
Other AF behaviors contribute to secure attachment as well (De Wolff and van
IJzendoorn 1997; Pederson et al. 1998). These include high-quality communication that is
open, direct, coherent, and fluent in attachment-related situations. AFs with secure children
use warm, positive statements to direct their children and are less controlling, use less
corporal punishment, and report more positive moods and enjoyment of their children than
AFs with insecure children (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002). AFs are accessible,
cooperative, and accepting of their children. This constellation of behaviors is sometimes
referred to as attunement, mutuality, synchrony, or insightfulness. Sensitive AFs and secure
children respond to one another contingently, much as you would see in a wellsynchronized dance. Insightful AFs consider the childs motives and feelings, and take
into consideration the childs perspective in a child-focused way (Koren-Karie et al. 2002).
High school students whose AFs are attuned to them are more likely to be securely attached
than those whose AFs are not attuned (Allen et al. 2003).
Insecure/avoidant
Insecure/avoidant children appear very independent of their AF and display no clear
preference for the AF. As toddlers they may turn away from the AF, appear deaf to the AFs
call, lean out of the AFs arms, and keep their backs to the AF. As older children they do
not seek contact when distressed, or communicate distress or vulnerability, and they avoid
becoming emotionally close. They physically and emotionally avoid the AF (Behrens et al.
2007). As teens they may deny the personal impact of parentchild relationships, and may
communicate dysfunctional levels of anger, but are also likely to avoid such discussions
(Allen and Land 1999; Crittenden 1992; Hodges et al. 1999; Main and Cassidy 1988;
Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002).
Childrens avoidant behavior makes sense because their AFs tend to be insensitive,
intrusive, angry, and rejecting (Ainsworth 1979; Crittenden 1992). The AF may withdraw
from helping the children with difficult tasks (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002).
The AF has been frequently unavailable when the children were in emotional turmoil. The
children are left with conflict between their biological drive to contact the AF and anger
toward the AF. Avoidant behavior is a defense against anger. The children suppress their
negative emotions in the presence of the non-supportive AF, so that the AF will not reject
or separate from them. This keeps the AF near in case they really need help (Ainsworth
1979). Thus, avoidant children exhibit cool indifference in order to maintain proximity with
an adult who rebuffs them.
Insecure/resistant
Insecure/resistant children fail to derive feelings of security from the AF. As toddlers they
have difficulty moving away from the AF to explore novel settings. They may show
f144
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
exaggerated emotions and are difficult to soothe. They seek contact, but do not appear to be
comforted by it. They may be passive, whiney, fussy, helpless, or immature, or they may be
angry, petulant, and resistant toward the AF. As older children they may also be demanding
of and preoccupied with the AF (Behrens et al. 2007; Main 1999; Main and Cassidy 1988;
Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002). They may appear hyperactive as they drift from
object to object. As teens they may express a strong need for their AF in stressful situations,
have trouble separating, have excessive concern about the AFs whereabouts, and have
difficulty recovering from upset (Hodges et al. 1999). They may be angry with their AFs
even while attempting to try to please them (Hesse 1999).
Resistant children may be responding to low levels of sensitivity in their AFs, who are
unresponsive to all but the strongest signals from their children. AFs may seem dependent
on the approval of their children. They may have difficulty allowing their children to direct
their own play, often squabbling with children as though there were two children instead of
an adult and child (Crittenden 1992). AFs often report feeling depressed, anxious, and
dissatisfied with their marriages and home interactions (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren
2002). Their children are unsure of the AFs ability or willingness to respond to them, but
do not fear rejection. As a result, they may coerce the AF into constant availability by using
angry threats, tantrums, pouting, sullenness, or other exaggerated displays of emotions or
helplessness. Resistant childrens clingy, dependent behavior elicits caregiving from an AF
who is inconsistently or inadequately responsive.
Insecure/disorganized-disoriented
Insecure/disorganized-disoriented children lack an organized response to the AF. As
toddlers their attachment behaviors are contradictory. For example, they might approach the
door when they hear mother returning, but then run to the other side of the room. They
appear apprehensive, and their stress behaviors may actually intensify when they approach
their AF. These behaviors are often fleeting and subtle. As older children they may take
charge to an unnatural degree in order to reduce uncertainty and may appear confident, yet
brittle and anxious (Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002). They may take on the parent
role by behaving in a solicitous way toward the AF, or by trying to punish or embarrass the
AF (Behrens et al. 2007; Main and Cassidy 1988). Their play may be characterized by
violence and helplessness (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999). As teens they cannot discuss
attachment coherently, or may express unresolved loss (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999).
Disorganized children may be responding to their AFs incomprehensible or frightening
behavior (Main 1999). Frightening behaviors include looming into the childs face,
approaching the child in an aggressive way, exhibiting trance-like behavior, showing fearful
facial expressions, and handling the child as though the child were an inanimate object.
Frightening behaviors put children in an inescapable conflict because the person they are
drawn to for reassurance and security is also frightening (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999).
Not all AFs of disorganized children are frightening; some are simply extremely insensitive
(Bernier and Meins 2008; Stevenson-Hinde and Verschueren 2002). AFs of disorganized
children often have a history of abuse, drug use, depression, or loss such as death or divorce
(E. A. Carlson 1998). They are more likely to live without a partner, be intrusive and
insensitive, and be psychologically unavailable, neglectful, or physically abusive. Many
maltreated children have disorganized attachment (V. Carlson et al. 1989).
Child factors can also contribute to security of attachment. Childrens medical fragility
or difficult temperament can make it more difficult for caregivers to develop secure
attachment with them. However, childrens temperament makes only a small contribution to
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
145
attachment security (Bokhorst et al. 2003; Vaughn and Bost 1999). Many difficult children
become securely attached with sensitive parenting (Pauli-Pott et al. 2007; Vaughn and Bost
1999). Furthermore, randomized controlled experiments have found that interventions that
improve parental sensitivity also improve attachment (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. 2003).
Together, such research suggests that parent behavior drives the security of the relationship
more than child behavior. About 5060% of children are secure, another 2025% are
avoidant, and another 1015% are resistant. About 1025% are disorganized, but as many as
60% may be disorganized in high-risk samples (C. A. Bergin and McCullough 2009;
OConnor and McCartney 2007; van IJzendoorn et al. 1992). Childrens attachment type
tends to be stable over time. However, when adults change in their responsiveness to
children, security of attachment can change (Grossmann and Grossmann 1991; Howes et al.
1998b; Lewis et al. 2000; Weinfield et al. 2000).
Researchers disagree about whether these four types adequately describe the variation in
attachment relationships (Fraley and Spieker 2003). Some research uses just two categories
secure vs. insecurewhile other research uses a continuum of security in attachment. The
research we will review in this article uses all of these typologies, but the most common
is the 4-fold typology discussed above.
Decades of research have shown that security of attachment is linked to a remarkable
array of child outcomes over long periods of time, including success at school. In general,
disorganized children have the most negative outcomes, secure children have the best
outcomes, and avoidant and resistant children are in-between. How might attachment affect
child outcomes beyond the AFchild relationship? A widely accepted explanation is the
development of internal working models, which are memories and expectations that
children carry into new interactions with others, that influence whether children approach or
avoid others, and that carry positive or hostile emotions (Bretherton and Munholland 1999).
These models serve as filters for understanding current and future interactions, and help the
child evaluate, predict, and choose behavior. They seem to become part of childrens
internal personality by about age three (S. C. Johnson et al. 2007; Schore 2000).
Important components of internal working models include the following: (1) a model of
others as trustworthy, (2) a model of the self as valuable, and (3) a model of the self as effective
when interacting with others. Secure children create a model that the AF can be relied on to
provide protection, security, and comfort (e.g., I can count on her to help meshe is
available and will help me get my emotions under control). This becomes an expectation for
the responsiveness of others in general, that others are caring and trustworthy, and that the
social world is a safe place (Ainsworth 1979; Bowlby 1973; Sroufe 1996). In contrast,
children who have a working model of the AF as inaccessible or unresponsive feel anxious.
Attachment to Parents is Linked to School Success
Security of attachment predicts academic achievement. This effect occurs as early as
toddlerhood for pre-academic skills. Insecure toddlers tend to have shorter attention spans
and perform worse on cognitive tasks than secure toddlers (Frankel and Bates 1990; Main
1983; Moss and St-Laurent 2001). While reading with their mothers, insecure toddlers are
less inclined to stay on their mothers lap and tend to be less attentive to the book. In
contrast, secure toddlers tend to be more engaged during joint story-book reading (Bus and
van IJzendoorn 1997). Secure preschoolers develop better reading or pre-reading skills and
better attitudes toward reading than insecurely attached preschoolers (Bus et al. 1997; Bus
and van IJzendoorn 1988a, b).
f146
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
After they enter school, insecure children tend to have lower verbal ability, math ability,
reading comprehension, and overall academic achievement, and exhibit less curiosity than
securely attached children (Granot and Mayseless 2001; Jacobsen and Hofmann 1997;
Pianta and Harbers 1996; Weinfield et al. 1999). For example, one study found that
attachment to mother and father predicted teacher ratings of school adaptationlike
academic skills and emotional well-beingfor third, fifth, and sixth graders (Kerns et al.
2000). In another study, attachment to mother predicted scholastic skill, GPA, and
scholastic attitude among Israeli sixth graders, above and beyond the effects of IQ and selfesteem. This effect occurred for both concurrent attachment as well as for attachment
measured 10 years earlier in infancy (Aviezer et al. 2002).
Insecure attachment in high school may also predict lower achievement during the first
year in college. One study found that insecure students, compared to secure students, were
more poorly prepared for exams, did not concentrate as well, feared failure, sought less help
from teachers, and gave less priority to studies (Larose et al. 2005).
Why might parentchild attachment predict academic achievement? Possible answers
come from one of the most well-known longitudinal studies of attachment, begun in
Minneapolis in the 1970s with low-SES families (Sroufe et al. 1983). Attachment was
assessed at 12 and 18 months of age. A few years later, the childrens preschool teachers rated
insecure children as less curious, more dependent, less empathic, less compliant, lower in
self-esteem, less emotionally positive, and less socially competent than secure children.
Teachers interacted with insecure children less positively, and their peers liked them less.
At age 10, the same children were brought together for a 4-week summer camp
(Shulman et al. 1994). During the camp, counselors again rated children who had been
insecurely attached in infancy as less socially competent, less self-confident, less
emotionally healthy, and more dependent compared with children with secure histories.
They made fewer friends at camp and spent less time with friends. In addition, the insecure
children were more likely to become friends with other insecure children. At age 15, the
children attended a series of camp reunions (E. A. Carlson 1998). Again, infant attachment
predicted social competence and independence. Psychopathology in teens was modestly
predicted by insecure attachment in infancy.
Thus, the Minnesota study found that parentchild attachment was linked to several
outcomes relevant to school success. These outcomes include (1) willingness to accept
challenges and independence, (2) social competence, (3) emotion regulation, (4) ADHD
behaviors, and (5) psychopathology and delinquency. These findings have been supported
by later research, which we discuss next.
Accepting challenges and independence
In the Minnesota study, teachers rated insecure preschoolers as less persistent, enthusiastic,
self-confident, and tolerant of frustration than secure children (Weinfield et al. 1999). At
15 years of age, they were more dependent. Similarly, in the Israeli study of sixth graders,
teachers viewed insecure children as less able to work independently and cope with
frustration or criticism (Aviezer et al. 2002).
Sroufe (1996) has argued that resistant attachment tends to result in children who are
either easily frustrated, tense, and anxious, or dependent, passive, helpless, and preoccupied
with the attachment figure. Avoidant attachment tends to result in children who are hostile
or emotionally disconnected. This serves to keep people and feelings at a distance, which is
sometimes mistakenly interpreted as independence. However, in the classroom, avoidant
children actually seek more contact with their teachers than secure children, although they
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
147
also are less likely to seek help when hurt or frustrated, and are more likely to be defiant.
This elicits angry or controlling behavior from the teacher.
Social competence
Insecurely attached children are less likely to be socially competent throughout childhood
than secure children. Insecure children tend to have poor quality friendships. For example,
in one study, insecure 10 year olds had no good friends, or they reported having many
friends but were unable to name one. They also reported being ridiculed or excluded by
peers (Grossmann and Grossmann 1991). While being interviewed, they tended to ignore
the interviewer or to be overly close, seeking physical contact.
Insecure children are also more likely than secure children to exhibit behavior problems.
In one study, 71% of the cases of serious preschool aggression involved children with
disorganized attachment histories (Lyons-Ruth et al. 1993). In another study, peers in fourth
through eighth grade described insecure children as aggressive, argumentative, dishonest,
disruptive, withdrawn, and anxious (Hodges et al. 1999). Avoidant and disorganized
children are the most at risk for antisocial behavior in preschool and elementary school
(Goldwyn et al. 2000; Granot and Mayseless 2001; Moss et al. 1998; NICHD Early Child
Care Research Network 2006). Still, many avoidant or disorganized children are not
markedly hostile. Thus, backward prediction is clearer than forward prediction.
Cross-sectional studies indicate that secure children have more harmonious and intimate
friendships, are more empathic toward peers, are more well-liked by peers, and are
preferred playmates in preschool through first grade. They are described as more socially
competent by preschool and high school teachers, as well as by peers in high school (Allen
et al. 1998, 2007; Clark and Ladd 2000; Cohn 1990; DeMulder et al. 2000; LaFreniere et
al. 1992; Weinfield et al. 1999). Even in college, secure freshmen report feeling more
validated and cared for (Grabill and Kerns 2000) and have a larger, high-quality social
support network (Anders and Tucker 2000).
The link between parentchild attachment and childrens social competence at school
has been found from preschool to high school, and from low-risk to high-risk populations,
although the effects may be strongest for low-income, minority children (Allen et al. 1998;
Anan and Barnett 1999; Frankel and Bates 1990; Hodges et al. 1999; Troy and Sroufe
1987). Still, not all studies find an effect of attachment on peer social competence, and there
is great variation in effect size. Pooling published studies, Schneider and colleagues (2001)
concluded that there was an overall effect size of 0.20.
Social competence is foundational to academic achievement because schooling is a
social endeavor. Across the school years, children who are prosocial tend to have higher
grades and test scores than less prosocial children (Miles and Stipek 2006; Wentzel 1993).
In contrast, antisocial and rejected children tend to have lower grades and test scores, more
reading and learning disabilities, more attention and thought problems, and greater risk of
dropping out (Bub et al. 2007; Buhs and Ladd 2001; Dishion et al. 1991; French and
Conrad 2001; Horn and Packard 1985; Hymel et al. 2002; Ladd and Burgess 2001; Malecki
and Elliot 2002; Trzesniewski et al. 2006; Wentzel 1993; Zettergren 2003). Antisocial
children tend to spend less time on task in the classroom, exhibit poor academic skills, and
complete less homework (Patterson et al. 1989). Antisocial children tend to have low
achievement even when other risk factors such as low intelligence, single parent household,
high absenteeism, unstimulating home environment, and low SES are statistically
controlled (Masten et al. 2005; Prior et al. 1999; Wentzel 1993). Thus, attachment may
affect childrens achievement at least in part through social competence at school.

Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
What might explain the link between attachment and social competence? One
mechanism is modeling. Parents of secure children model warmth, sensitivity, and positive
emotions. Children who live with such parents learn to get along better with teachers and
peers than children with insensitive parents (Stright et al. 2008). A second mechanism is
through emotion regulation.
Emotional regulation
Attachment is the foundation of emotion regulation (Sroufe 1996). Insecure children lack
experience with successful emotion regulation. As early as 4 months of age, children with
insensitive mothers are poorly regulated compared to children with sensitive mothers
(Braungart-Reiker et al. 2001). Caregivers of resistant children wait until upset has
escalated to high levels before soothing. This trains children to have a rapid rise of intense
emotions, makes them increasingly more difficult to soothe, and results in children who
readily feel threatened, frustrated, anxious, and helpless (Thompson 1991). They underregulate their emotions.
Caregivers of avoidant children are unresponsive, emotionally unavailable, or hostile.
This trains children to rigidly squelch emotions and not seek others help, which limits their
opportunity to learn more adaptive coping strategies (Cassidy 1994). They do not freely
express emotions that make them vulnerable, they avoid emotional involvement with
others, and they may become hostile, aggressive, and detached (Thompson et al. 1995).
They over-regulate their emotions.
In contrast, secure children learn from their sensitive parents that when emotion is
overwhelming, others are available to soothe them. They learn constructive coping
strategies, feel comfortable communicating their emotions, are willing to take on
emotionally challenging situations, and discuss hot topics without anger (Cassidy 1994;
Kobak et al. 1993; Sroufe 1996). Secure children recover readily from distress without
falling to pieces. Animal research shows that repeated experiences with a soothing
caregiver alters brain circuitry, resulting in a brain that can appropriately dampen high
arousal and regulate emotions (Cassidy 1994).
Emotion regulation, in turn, is foundational to the other important outcomes we have
discussed thus far. For example, emotion regulation is foundational to accepting challenges
at school. Because insecure children have fewer coping skills, they are unwilling to take on
potentially frustrating tasks, less able to discuss emotional topics without anger, and
respond negatively to novel situations at school (Kobak et al. 1993; Sroufe 1996).
Emotion regulation is also foundational to academic achievement. Insecure children may
do poorly in school because they often feel anxiety, which interferes with learning (Gunnar
et al. 1996; Hunsley 1987; Perry 1997). Learning is a result of engaging new, unfamiliar
objects or information in a constructive way. Yet novelty causes emotional arousal. If the
child does not have good emotion regulation, anxiety results and the child is not able to
engage with novelty, or learn. Instead of attending to the goals that a teacher has set,
anxious children attend to potential threats and their own safety. Children who are
repeatedly exposed to anxiety early in life may be at risk for over-activation of the
amygdala, which can lead to chronic problems with attention and thought (Blair 2001).
Anxiety is also associated with compromised immune functioning and illness (Maier and
Watkins 2000). Thus, anxious children may often be absent from school, which also
interferes with achievement.
Finally, emotion regulation is foundational to social competence at school. Children who
have poor emotion regulation are not as well-liked and are perceived as less socially
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
149
competent by both teachers and peers (Eisenberg et al. 1995, 1997; McDowell et al. 2000).
This is probably because children with poor emotion regulation typically express more
negative than positive emotions, which leads to aggression and less prosocial behavior
(Arsenio et al. 2000; Denham et al. 1990, 2003; Talley and Bergin 1998). In contrast, the
smiles of happy children invite others to join them, and help sustain social interaction
(Sroufe et al. 1984). In one study, first to fourth graders who expressed more positive than
negative emotions at school were rated by teachers as more popular and well-behaved
(Jones et al. 2002).
Healthy relationships require trust, self-disclosure, and reciprocity, so that true feelings
can be shared. Secure children are free to be emotionally expressive (Sroufe 1996). Secure
parentchild pairs can discuss past misbehavior with more emotional openness than
insecure parentchild pairs (Laible and Thompson 2000). Secure children can express anger
or say, I hate you to a parent, and still be confident that the parent will continue to care
about them. Insecure children cannot. Their parents may not be able to contain their own
negative emotions and may over-react, or they may dismiss their childrens feelings (e.g.,
You cant hate me. Im your mother). In self-defense, the child must shut off negative
emotions so they are not overwhelming. Unfortunately, the strategies children use to
protect themselves in insecure relationships can be carried over to prevent healthy future
relationships with peers and teachers at school. As a result, insecure children tend to
show ambivalence and contradiction in their relationships, a false self, emotional
disturbance (withdrawal or aggression), fearfulness, or hyper-vigilance. Some are
indiscriminant in their friendliness and attention seeking, and have difficulty forming
close relationships.
Attention deficits and hyperactivity
Anxious attachment is linked to ADHD. Insecure children are more likely to be diagnosed
with ADHD, or have ADHD symptoms regardless of being diagnosed (Clarke et al. 2002;
Egeland et al. 1993). For example, a study of 5 to 7 year olds with disorganized attachment
found they had social and attention problems according to their teachers (Goldwyn et al.
2000). This is presumably because anxiety impairs ability to control attention, executive
functions, memory, and problem-solving, and increases task-irrelevant thoughts (Fincham
et al. 1989; Ialongo et al. 1994). In contrast, secure children tend to have longer attention
spans and higher cognitive test scores (Frankel and Bates 1990; Main 1983; Moss and
St-Laurent 2001).
The link between attachment security and ADHD symptoms may be due to its effect on
emotion regulation and anxiety. It may also be due to parents intrusiveness, which is a
precursor to insecure attachment. Intrusiveness refers to parent behavior that directs the
childs activity according to the parents agenda without regard for the childs agenda.
Parents intrusiveness is associated with frustration, hyperactivity, and attention deficits in
preschoolers, as well as academic and emotional problems in elementary children (Egeland
et al. 1993). Parents intrusiveness in infancy is linked with ADHD behaviors 6 to 8 years
later (Sroufe 1989, 1996).
Psychopathology and delinquency
Insecure attachment is not considered pathology per se, but is a risk factor for mental
illness. Although most avoidant or resistant children do not develop clinically identified
mental illness, according to some research 2550% of disorganized children display
f150
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
significant problems by early elementary school (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999). In
addition, compared to secure teens, insecure teens suffer greater rates of maladjustment,
suicidal thoughts, depression, conduct disorders, substance abuse, and eating disorders
(Allen and Land 1999; Hesse 1999; Lewis et al. 2000; Weinfield et al. 1999). Insecure
attachment has also been linked to anxiety and social withdrawal (LaFreniere et al. 1992;
Lyons-Ruth and Jacobvitz 1999; Rubin and Lollis 1988). Delinquency and psychopathology take a toll on individual students and their peers and diminish the learning
environment.
In summary, security of attachment is linked to academic achievement from preschool
through high school. This link may be the result of attachments effect on many dimensions
of childrens functioningsuch as ability to take on academically challenging tasks, work
independently, pay attention, tolerate frustration, be happy, contain aggression, be liked by
peers, and have high-quality friendshipseach of which, in turn, is linked to academic
achievement. Figure 1 displays a model of relations among these variables. There is
research to support each link in this model, although the full model has not been empirically
tested. We present it as a framework to help educators understand how parentchild
attachment may predict childrens academic achievement. Can this research be applied to
childrens relationships with teachers?
Attachment to Teachers is Linked to School Success
To be effective, teachers must connect with and care for children with warmth, respect, and
trust. It may be easier for teachers to establish attachment relationships in preschool or
primary classrooms where teachers spend more time with students than in secondary
schools, and tend to a broader range of their needs. Indeed, most of the research on teacher
student attachment has occurred in early childhood settings, rather than in secondary
schools. Nevertheless, even in secondary schools both teachers and students believe that
good teachers establish trusting, close relationships with students (Beishuizzen et al. 2001).
Thus, we will discuss research pertinent to secondary schools, but by necessity emphasize
early childhood. Later, we will discuss research on school bonding, which emphasizes
secondary schools.
A preschool typology of teacherchild attachment
Researchers assessed attachment to early childhood teachers for 3,062 predominantly poor,
European American and African American preschoolers (Howes and Ritchie 1999). They

described four types of attachment to teachers that parallel the typology for parentchild
attachment:
1. Avoidant children were more interested in classroom materials than in the teacher or
other children. They did not approach the teacher, so the teacher easily lost track of
them. When the teacher approached, they acted as if they did not hear or notice the
teacher. If requested to come to the teacher, they did so, but quickly left. They did not
call out to the teacher to show something. When hurt or upset they did not seek the
teacher, or even moved away if the teacher tried to comfort them.
2. Resistant children were irritable and fussy with the teacher for no apparent reason.
They often cried and were difficult to console. They resisted classroom routines like
cleaning up. They clung to the teacher and cried if the teacher left the room. Every
bump or scratch brought tears. They were easily frustrated by difficult tasks. They were
demanding and impatient with the teacher and not satisfied with the teachers attempts
to respond to them.
3. Secure children accepted comfort if hurt or upset, molding their bodies to the teacher if
held. They spontaneously hugged the teacher. They touched the teacher gently during
play. They readily shared their activities with the teacher, showing things and
welcoming entrance into play. They asked for help if they needed it. They read the
teachers face for information. They easily followed directives, and acted sorry if the
teacher spoke firmly to them. They made transitions smoothly. They were glad to see
the teacher at the beginning of the day.
4. Near secure children displayed moderate avoidant behaviors and some secure
behaviors. They distrusted their teachers, but conformed readily to classroom
procedures, such that teachers did not perceive a problem in their relationship. This
category could be thought of as attachment in the making.
In a study of impoverished, predominantly African American 4 year olds, the same
behaviors that characterize a secure motherchild attachment were characteristic of secure
teacherstudent relationships, such as keeping track of the other, using the adult as a secure
base from which to explore, being comforted and reassured by the adults presence, and
being attuned to the others facial expressions and emotions (Pianta et al. 1997).
An elementary school typology of teacherchild relationships
In elementary school, Pianta and colleagues distinguish between secure and dependent
teacherstudent relationships. A secure teacherstudent relationship is characterized by
trust, feeling in tune with the student, and perceptions that the student feels safe with the
teacher, the student would seek help, and the teacher could console the student (Pianta and
Nimetz 1991, p. 384). A dependent relationship is characterized by teacher perceptions that
the student is constantly seeking help or reassurance and reacting negatively to separation
from the teacher (Pianta and Nimetz 1991, p. 385). This is akin to Howes and Ritchies
preschool typology of resistant teacherstudent relationship.
Are teacherchild relationships attachment?
Not all positive relationships are attachment. Recall that attachment is a deep and enduring
affectionate bond that connects one person to another across time and space. Children show
preference for their attachment figure over other adults. They retreat to the AF when
distressed and are readily soothed. The sensitive AF, in turn, attends to the needs of the
f152
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
child and responds to the childs signals. Sensitive AFs make children feel secure, liberating
them to explore their environment.
While some teacherstudent relationships qualify as attachment relationships, some do
not. In teacherstudent relationships, it can be difficult to distinguish between extremely
insecure attachment and non-attachment (Howes 1999). Non-attachment refers to how a
child would relate to a casual acquaintance. Children have biologically innate propensities
to attach to adults who spend time with them and who care for them. Thus, children,
especially young children, may seek to form attachment relationships with teachers.
However, some teachers and school structures promote non-attachment because they do not
present the opportunity to attach. There is too little interaction between the teacher and a
particular child. Other settings do present the child with the opportunity to attach, but the
teacher is too unresponsive or insensitive for attachment to develop.
Many teacherstudent relationships may fall between non-attachment and attachment
because they have some, but not all, of the characteristics and fulfill some of the functions
of an attachment relationship. Because the research we review is not limited to relationships
that are clearly attachment, from this point forward we will use the term teacherstudent
relationships to acknowledge that while they are attachment-like, not all teacherstudent
relationships should be characterized as attachment.
Outcomes linked to teacherstudent relationships
Preschool
Child outcomes linked to teacherstudent relationships parallel those of attachment to
parents. This has been found repeatedly at the preschool level. For example, Pianta and
colleagues (1997) found that a positive teacherstudent relationship predicted growth in
language and conceptual knowledge. Howes and Ritchie (1999) found that teacherstudent
relationships predicted childrens social competence. Children with secure teacherstudent
relationships played in more complex ways with their peers. Resistant children had more
difficulties with peers, and avoidant children were more hesitant to engage with peers.
Teachers perceived the resistant children as more disturbed in classroom behavior than
avoidant children, perhaps because the avoidant children kept away from teachers.
Elementary school
Similar effects have been found at the elementary level. In a study of several hundred first
to fifth graders, emotionally warm, sensitive teachers had students with greater growth in
math and reading ability (Pianta et al. 2008). In a study of 827 first-grade classrooms in 32
states, emotionally supportive teachers had students who were more likely to engage in
academic activities, experience positive relations with peers, and avoid negative behaviors
(National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research
Network 2002).
Other studies have found that children with close teacherstudent relationships tend
to perform well academically including having higher scores on achievement tests, more
positive attitudes toward school, more engagement in the classroom, less retention in
grade, and fewer referrals for special education (Birch and Ladd 1997; Hamre and Pianta
2001). Even children whose school readiness scores indicate a high risk for retention or
special education referral are less likely to actually be retained or referred if they have a
close teacherstudent relationship in kindergarten (Pianta and Nimetz 1991). In contrast,
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
153
children with a dependent teacherstudent relationshipin which the child is
possessive, clingy, and overly reliant on the teachertend to have adjustment problems
like negative attitude toward school, poor academic performance, social withdrawal, and
aggression.
Secondary school
It is more challenging to develop secure teacherstudent relationships in secondary schools
because children spend less time with a single teacher. Yet many adults can tell stories of
secondary teachers whose caring had profound effects on them. In a recent book, The Ones
We Remember (Pajares and Urdan 2008), educators reminisce about teachers who changed
their lives. For example, Bergin (2008) wrote of a high school science teacher who
influenced students career choices and life-long pursuit of hobbies, and whom students
continued to visit many years after leaving high school.
Research confirms these anecdotal stories that teacherstudent relationships are
important to secondary students. In a study of high school students in rural Massachusetts,
attachment to both parent and teacher contributed to students academic motivation and
learning strategies, but the teacherstudent relationship more strongly predicted classroom
behavior (Learner and Kruger 1997). In another study, sixth to eighth graders who believed
that their teacher cared about them were more motivated to try hard and pay attention in
class, and earned higher grades (Wentzel 1997). In yet another study, Black youth were
cooperative and engaged in the classrooms of teachers who focused on building trusting
relationships with students; the same youth were suspended from another teachers
classroom for defiance (Gregory and Ripski 2008). In a study of junior high students, poor
teacherstudent relationships in math classes were associated with children not valuing
math (Eccles et al. 1993).
Secure teacherstudent relationships may also protect children from antisocial behavior
like aggression, drug and alcohol use, violence, and early sexual activity (Howes and
Ritchie 1999; Howes et al. 1988; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 2002; Pianta
et al. 1997). For example, in one study, youth who reported attachment-like relationships
with their teachers were less likely to use drugs and alcohol, attempt suicide, engage in
violence, or become sexually active at an early age (Resnick et al. 1997).
Longitudinal outcomes
Early teacherstudent relationships may be particularly important because they predict
long-term well-being in school. For example, a study in Texas found that positive teacher
student relationships in first grade were linked to engagement, effort, and attention in
second grade and higher test scores in third grade among low-SES children (Hughes et al.
2008). In another study, a conflicted teacherstudent relationship predicted reduced
cooperative participation and school liking, and increased misconduct and attention
problems, from fall of kindergarten to spring of first grade (Ladd and Burgess 2001). In
a remarkable longitudinal study, an entire kindergarten population in a small city school
district with a diverse population (35% African American) was followed through eighth
grade (Hamre and Pianta 2001). A negative teacherstudent relationship in kindergarten
predicted lower grades, lower standardized test scores, and poorer work habits throughout
elementary school, which in turn predicted lower academic achievement in eighth grade.
This long-term outcome is noteworthy given that, by eighth grade, the children had
transitioned through three school levels.
f154
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
Early teacherstudent relationships could have long-term outcomes because they
influence subsequent relationships, perhaps because the quality of teacherstudent
relationships tends to be stable over time. For example, in the Ladd and Burgess (2001)
study, teacherstudent closeness and conflict were stable from fall of kindergarten to spring
of first grade. In another study, 9 year olds perceptions of their relationship with their
current elementary teacher were predicted by their relationship with their first teacher when
they were toddlers or preschoolers in childcare (Howes et al. 1998a, b). Perhaps they
formed an internal working model of teacher as either positive or negative, and with each
new teacher behaved in a way that was consistent with this model, thus eliciting similar
patterns of interaction from the teachers. This is similar to parentchild attachment, which
also tend to be stable across childhood.
The research on teacherstudent relationships is correlational, so one cannot assume that
a negative relationship caused later problems. It is plausible that early child behavior
problems caused the negative relationship and/or later problems. Nevertheless, there is
logical and theoretical support for causation from teacherstudent relationship to school
maladjustment.
In summary, evidence suggests that secure teacherstudent relationships predict greater
knowledge, higher test scores, greater academic motivation, and fewer retentions or special
education referrals than insecure teacherstudent relationships. In contrast, children who have
conflicted relationships with teachers tend to like school less, experience less self-direction,
and show lower levels of cooperation in classroom activities. This raises the important
question of how teachers can develop more secure relationships with their students.
Antecedents of secure teacherstudent relationships
The same antecedents of secure parentchild attachment predict secure teacherstudent
relationships. That is, secure relationships are more likely to develop when teachers are
involved with, sensitive toward, and have frequent positive interactions with children
(Howes and Hamilton 1992a; Howes and Smith 1995; Kontos et al. 1995; Whitebook et al.
1989). Ambivalent children tend to experience more teacher involvement and sensitivity
than avoidant children, but less than secure children.
In addition, there may be some antecedents of secure relationships that are unique to
classrooms. Teachers communicate caring for students by being well prepared for class,
showing their real self, and holding high expectations for students (Davis 2003). Caring
teachers also grant autonomy to students during classroom assignments. In a study of fourth
and sixth graders, children reported feeling greater rapport with adults who were autonomy
supporting rather than controlling (Gurland and Grolnick 2003). Autonomy support
involved sensitivity to the childs agenda and providing children with choice. In this study,
both controlling and autonomy-supportive teachers were emotionally positive with the
children, so simple positivity did not explain differences in rapport. Reeve and Jang (2006)
found that teacher behaviors like allowing students to work in their own way, offering
encouragement, and avoiding should/ought statements correlated with students perceptions
of autonomy. An autonomy-supporting approach in the classroom is akin to the sensitive,
non-intrusive care found in parents whose children are securely attached.
Similarity of attachment to parents and to teachers
Attachment is a relationship, not a trait inborn in children. That is, it is the result of many
interactions between a specific adult and a specific child. Thus, children who are securely
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
155
attached to a parent might not be securely attached to a teacher. Research confirms that
there is not much relationship between attachment to parents and attachment to teachers in
very young children (Howes and Hamilton 1992b). In a study of White, middle-class
preschoolers, only 45% of the children had the same security of attachment to mother and
to childcare provider (Howes et al. 1988).
Among very young children, those with insecure parentchild attachment can develop a
secure relationship with teachers. In the Howes et al. (1988) study, more children were
securely attached to their caregiver than to their mother. In another study of infants in
childcare in the Netherlands, where professional caregivers tend to be more sensitive than
high-SES parents, half of the children who had an insecure relationship with both father and
mother developed a secure relationship with the caregiver (Goossens and van IJzendoorn
1990).
Beyond infancy, however, children with insecure parentchild attachment are likely to
develop insecure relationships with teachers (DeMulder et al. 2000). A possible reason why
this pattern is not seen in younger children is that their internal models are still in the
making.
Among school-age children, attachment history influences new attachment relationships.
Unfortunately, the behavior of insecure children elicits responses in teachers that make it
difficult to attach to them. Such behavior includes clinginess, hostility, helplessness, and
disobedience. This may explain why childrens attachment to their parents affects the way
teachers react to them (Pianta 1999; Sroufe 1996). Teachers interact with secure children in
a warm manner and hold high standards for them to behave well. Teachers tend to interact
with insecure children in a controlling manner, are less likely to expect compliance, and
tend to use repeated directives. Teachers are more tolerant, nurturing, and controlling
toward resistant children because teachers perceive them as immature and needy. Teachers
tend to treat resistant children as though they were younger. Teachers are more likely to be
angry and rejecting with avoidant children, and to isolate them because they defy adults and
may hurt other children. Thus, teachers find it more difficult to develop a positive
relationship with children who have insecure parentchild attachments.
Meeting the needs of insecure students
Recall that 1/3 to 1/2 of children have an insecure attachment with at least one parent. This
means that insecure children are common in classrooms. Because teachers naturally react
more negatively to insecure students, it is difficult for teachers to establish secure
relationships with them. Howes and Ritchie (1999) found that children from difficult life
circumstances can develop secure attachments to their preschool teachers, but less than 1/3
did so, suggesting that teachers do not readily develop a positive relationship with poor
children who approach them with distrust or avoidance. Yet, a secure teacherstudent
relationship is an important protective factor for such children.
Fortunately, it is possible for insecure children to develop secure teacherstudent
relationships. Even in school-age children, both the childs attachment history and the
behavior of the current teacher contribute to the new relationship. If teachers are able to
behave in ways that disconfirm the insecure childs internal working models, then a secure
relationship can develop between teacher and child. A caring teacher has to work to
disconfirm insecure childrens expectation that the teacher will be hostile, rejecting, or
unresponsive. This is important because children with insecure parentchild attachment
who are able to develop a secure teacherstudent relationship fare better socially,
emotionally, and academically (OConnor and McCartney 2007). For example, in a study
f156
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
of preschoolers, when the parentchild relationship was insecure, secure attachment to the
teacher seemed to partially compensate because the children were more prosocial and
emotionally positive than children with an insecure relationship to both parent and teacher
(Mitchell-Copeland et al. 1997).
Children vary in how much they need to attach to teachers. Children who have secure
attachment to parents are not likely to need an additional secure adultchild relationship,
yet they are easier for teachers to attach to. In contrast, maltreated children have a special
need for attachment to teachers, and may be particularly prone to seek psychological
proximity to teachers, yet they are more difficult for teachers to like and support. In one
study of 7- to 13-year-old maltreated children, the children were significantly more likely to
wish that their teacher paid more attention to them than non-maltreated children. Children
who wished that they were closer to their mothers also wished they were closer to their
teachers (Lynch and Cicchetti 1992). In addition to having attachment-like relationships
with teachers, children can feel attachment toward their school, our next topic.
School Bonding
School bonding refers to a sense of belonging at school and having a network of
relationships with peers and teachers. School bonding is akin to attachment in that it can
make children feel secure and valued, which can liberate them to take on intellectual and
social challenges and explore new ideas. A child who is bonded to school has a sense that
people at school like me. A child who is not bonded to school feels lonely, outcast, and
alienated. In one study of a school of 1,500, students with no school bonding said I dont
have any friends at school, or No one wants to talk to me at school (Mouton et al. 1996).
They reported not knowing the principal at all, and disliking all of the teachers except
possibly one. They felt their teachers did not know or like them and treated them unfairly.
They felt that teachers did not notice when they missed school, and did not want them to
do well.
Both classrooms and schools can vary in socioemotional climate, or how valued they
make students feel. The climate of a classroom is affected by the teacherstudent
relationship and how much a teacher enjoys students, although the particular composition
of the students can make a large difference as well (Marsh et al. 2008). In secondary
schools, how students feel about school and their coursework is in large measure
determined by the quality of the relationship they have with their teachers in specific
classes (Osterman 2000, p. 344). If students perceive their teachers as supportive and feel
secure in teacherstudent relationships, they have greater interest and engagement in
school, which is related to achievement and grades. Clearly, teacherstudent relationships
are an important component of school bonding.
Participation in extracurricular activities is another important component of school
bonding. High school students feel more connected to school when there is a high rate of
participation in extracurricular activities in addition to a positive classroom climate
(McNeely et al. 2002). In one study, participation in extracurricular activities at middle
school prevented early school dropout (Mahoney and Cairns 1997). The least competent
students benefited the most, even though their involvement was often a single
extracurricular activity. This raises serious concerns about making extracurricular activities
exclusionary. Many extracurricular activities require expertise before a child can participate
(e.g., sports, music, quiz bowl, etc.) or require selection/election. Some activities require a
certain GPA, even though grades have nothing to do with the activity. Such policies
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
157
preclude some childrenprobably those who need it mostfrom participation and the
opportunity to belong at school.
Children report being happier and more motivated during extracurricular activities than
while in class (Mahoney et al. 2006). Extracurricular activities are freely chosen and
provide greater opportunity for establishing relationships with peers and coaches or teachers
than do most classroom activities.
Identification with school, belongingness, and positive relationships with teachers are
associated with lower levels of dropping out of school (Christenson and Thurlow 2004).
Effective programs for school completion focus, at least in part, on building students
relationships within the school. School bonding is also linked to less depression in
adolescents (Jacobson and Rowe 1999).
School bonding influences achievement. A study of kindergartners found that children
who liked school participated in class more, which led to higher achievement (Ladd et al.
2000). In a study of low-income African American and Hispanic children, overall school
climatewhich leads to school bondingpredicted reading and math achievement scores
in first grade and school adjustment in second grade (Esposito 2000). The positive effects
of school bonding may be strongest in high poverty schools and for high-risk youth
(Osterman 2000; Resnick et al. 1997).
School bonding is particularly important in middle schools (Osterman 2000), yet
elementary schools are more likely to meet childrens need for belongingness. Indeed, as
children transition from elementary to junior high or middle school, and then again to high
school they become more negative about school. These transitions are linked to a decline in
grades, self-confidence, school interest, and extracurricular involvement (Juvonen 2007).
The decline is not extreme for most children. It may be worse for children experiencing
other changes such as moving or a divorce (Burchinal et al. 2008; Simmons and Blyth
1987; Zanobini and Usai 2002). With each transition, children must adjust to new teachers,
new class structure, and a new mix of peers.
Why is there increased negativity in secondary schools? Too often attributes of the
children, such as so-called raging hormones, are mistakenly blamed for school negativity,
but the real problem may be that secondary schools are not designed for belongingness.
Eccles and colleagues investigated the transition from elementary school to junior high
school, from grade 6 to grade 7 (Eccles et al. 1993). They found a poor fit between the
needs of children at this age and school structure. Junior highs are structured differently
from elementary schools in several ways. Two key differences that interfere with school
bonding are:
1. There is more emphasis on teacher control and discipline with less emphasis on student
choice and self-management. Teachers spend less time teaching, and more time
maintaining order. Yet, at this age, children seek more autonomy.
2. Teacherstudent relationships are less personal and positive. Children see teachers as
less friendly and teachers see children as less trustworthy, compared with the same
childrens relationships with their elementary teachers just 1 year earlier.
Children in K-8 programs, who do not make as many transitions, fare better than those who
make more transitions. Simmons and Blyth (1987) followed 621 children in Milwaukee from
sixth to tenth grade. Some children attended elementary school until sixth grade, junior high
for 3 years, and high school for 3 years. Others attended elementary until eighth grade, and
high school for 4 years. Those who had to transition to the junior high were more negative
toward school, were less involved in extracurricular activities, had lower math achievement,
lower grades, lower self-esteem (girls only), and were more victimized (boys only) than their
f158
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
same-age peers who did not make the transition. There were more negative reactions when
they transitioned yet again from the junior high to the senior high, particularly in selfesteem and extracurricular participation.
A decrease in school bonding as children move from elementary to secondary school is
not inevitable. International comparisons of 11 to 15 year olds find that U.S. secondary
students feel markedly less bonded and dislike school more than in some other countries
(Juvonen 2007). Whether students bond to a school depends on whether the structure of the
school presents opportunities for meeting attachment needs. We address ways to do this in
the next section.
Recommendations
To feel securely connected to others is a basic human need (Baumeister and Leary 1995).
Ideally, this need is met at school as well as at home. While attachment research has altered
other major institutions such as hospitals for the better, it has not influenced schools
sufficiently. One study found that about 25% of children in the upper elementary grades
perceive school as an uncaring place (Watson et al. 1997). Clearly there is room for
improvement. We recommend several approaches to promoting attachment-like relationships with teachers and school bonding. Some simply require individual teachers to behave
in specific ways with children, but others may require programmatic or even structural
changes in schools. We will begin with individual teachers.
Individual teachers
A teachers relationship with each child is important for raising achievement levels as well
as for improving socioemotional well-being. Teachers need to learn how to deal
constructively with children who have insecure attachment to parents. It is a challenge
not to act in ways that confirm insecure childrens working models. Insecure children seek
positive, warm, trusting relationships, but do not have the skills to create them. This means
it is up to the teacher to change childrens views of relationships and meet their
socioemotional needs. Based on the research summarized above, we make six recommendations for how teachers can improve their relationships with students and foster school
bonding:
1. Increase sensitivity and warm, positive interactions with students. Teacher sensitivity
refers to accurate detection and interpretation of childrens cues, provision of comfort,
and responsiveness to distress (Pianta et al. 2008). One way teachers become more
sensitive to children is to increase their knowledge of child development. Teachers who
know more about child development are more sensitive in their interactions with
children (Howes et al. 1988; Whitebook et al. 1989). Unfortunately, many colleges of
education give too little time to child development coursework.
2. Be well prepared for class and hold high expectations for students. This is one way that
teachers show they care about student achievement, in addition to increasing sensitivity
and being responsive (Davis 2003). Wentzel (1997) found that middle-school students
felt their teachers cared for them if they helped each student academically, like asking if
they needed help, calling on them, making sure they understood content, teaching in a
special way, and making class interesting. Non-caring teachers got off task, taught while
students were not paying attention, and did not answer questions or explain things.

3. Be responsive to students agendas by providing choice whenever possible. This may
help students feel greater rapport with teachers. Note that choice may be less important
for students from collectivist cultures than those from individualist cultures (Iyengar
and Lepper 2000; Katz and Assor 2007).
4. Use induction rather than coercive discipline. Induction involves explaining the reason
for rules and pointing out the consequences of breaking rules. Coercive discipline
involves using threats, imposing the teachers superior power, and taking advantage of
the teachers ability to control resources like recess time, grades, or detentions.
Coercion interferes with caring relationships (Noddings 1992). High school students
are more likely to feel school bonding if their school does not have harsh discipline
policies, like expelling students for relatively minor infractions (McNeely et al. 2002).
Children who are disciplined with inductionparticularly victim-centered induction in
which the adult points out how the childs behavior has made someone else feelare
likely to become prosocial and emotionally positive (C. Bergin 1987; Krevans and
Gibbs 1996; Paulussen-Hoogeboom et al. 2007). Unfortunately, even though teachers
find discipline to be a pervasive problem, less than 1% of peer-reviewed articles in
elementary education journals over a 10-year period addressed the issue of how to
effectively discipline (Hardman and Smith 2003). While there are many approaches to
classroom discipline, few have been evaluated using good science. Readers are referred
to Bergin and Bergin (1999) who discuss how to implement non-coercive discipline
from a sound theoretical and research basis. They point out that effective discipline
achieves compliance, but by using the least possible power and by keeping the
emotional tone positive and respectful. Teachers can do this by using reasoned
persuasion, rather than coercion.
5. Help students be kind, helpful, and accepting of one another. Peer culture is a key
component of school bonding (Juvonen 2007). Students tend to feel greater school
bonding if peers get along with each other (McNeely et al. 2002). One program, the
Child Development Project, effectively promotes prosocial behavior through building a
strong sense of community in the school and creating a caring classroom climate where
teachers are warm, use inductive discipline, encourage cooperation among students,
and use an authoritative teaching style (Schaps et al. 2004). Teachers can also help
children become more prosocial by providing children with opportunities to care for
and help each other (Mussen and Eisenberg 2001; Noddings 1992). Teachers can
increase prosocial behavior through modeling, such as complimenting students,
respecting students, and avoiding hurting their feelings (Wentzel 1997). Teachers can
increase prosocial behavior by praising and expressing gratitude for kindnesses, such as
you are a nice person or I really appreciate that you took the trouble to do that
(Bartlett and DeSteno 2006; McCullough et al. 2008; Mills and Grusec 1989; Mussen
and Eisenberg 2001).
6. Implement interventions for specific, difficult relationships. Pianta (1999) describes an
intervention he refers to as banking time because the teacher saves up positive
experiences in relationship capital that can later be drawn upon. For 5 to 15 min
each day, the teacher gives the child undivided attention and follows the childs lead in
whatever activity the child chooses. During these few minutes, the teacher does not do
any teaching, directing, or reinforcing, but rather acts as a sportscaster, simply giving a
play-by-play narrative of the childs actions. The teacher conveys acceptance, interest,
and safety to the child. This approach helps repair relationships where there are high
levels of conflict and the adult has been controlling and dominating with the child.
Relationship repair takes time, because insecure children have expectations that adults
f160
Educ Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
are negative, unsafe, and untrustworthy. The school psychologist or counselors should
be able to help teachers repair a difficult relationship with a specific child.
School-wide policies
The six approaches described above can be implemented by individual teachers within the
confines of their own classrooms, regardless of the larger school context. However, some
school policies and procedures can facilitate, or undermine, teacherstudent relationships
and school bonding. We make six additional recommendations for improving school-wide
policies:
1. Implement school-wide interventions. In schools with high-risk populations, teacher
student relationships can be improved throughout the school. For example, in a
therapeutic preschool where most children had been expelled from other preschools for
misbehavior, teachers focused on being consistently positive in order to disconfirm
childrens internal models of adults as inconsistent, neglectful, or harsh. Very few of
the children were securely attached to their teachers, but over time some became more
secure (Howes and Ritchie 1998). Those who made the most progress were those who
had initially been the most insecure.
2. Provide a variety of extracurricular activities that are accessible to students. High
school students feel more connected when there is a high rate of participation in
extracurricular activities (McNeely et al. 2002). Many high schools make participation
expensive in a way that limits accessibility (e.g., Bettis and Adams 2003).
3. Keep schools small. A nationally representative study of 75,000 seventh to twelfth
graders found that students feel more connected to their schools if the school is small
(McNeely et al. 2002). The optimal size for bonding was about 300; however, the
optimal size for academic curriculum may be larger. Some secondary schools are able
to partially mimic the positive effects of smaller schools by creating schools-within-aschool, which may also be called teams, pods, or learning communities (Felner et al.
2007). In contrast to school size, class size may not affect school bonding (McNeely et
al. 2002). In fact, classrooms that are too small can result in children not having
enough opportunity to find a peer buddy.
4. Provide continuity of people and place. Attachment takes time to develop. This
requires that teachers and students stay together long enough to form relationships. In a
preschool that emphasized relationships by having teachers move with children to older
classrooms, researchers found that it took at least 9 months with an expert teacher
before the children developed secure teacherstudent relationships (Raikes 1993). This
is probably an underestimate of the time needed for high-risk children, older children,
or children with insecure attachment histories to establish secure relationships. In a
childcare setting for homeless children in New York, attachment to teachers took from
several months to a few years, even though bonding was given priority, and one-on-one
time was regularly scheduled between teacher and child (Ansbach and Epstein 2000).
Thus, we might not expect bonding to occur until the end of a typical school year,
when relationships are normally ended. This situation could be improved in three ways:
(a)
Keep students together so peer groups are stable. Some secondary schools attempt
to do this by having teams of children attend multiple classes together.
(b) Keep children in the same building for several years. Some communities locate
kindergarten and preschools for high-risk children for the entire district in a single
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
161
central location that is different from where they will attend elementary school.
This means that as children advance in grade, they cannot drop in on their
previous teachers. Some school districts have too many levels of schools
elementary, middle, junior high, and senior highso that children only spend a
few years at each building. This undermines school bonding.
(c) Keep children with the same teacher or team of teachers for multiple years. For
example, in Sweden, teachers have the same students for grades 58 (Kerr and
Stattin 2000). Pianta (1999) taught the same middle school children for multiple
years and found that classroom management problems decreased, motivation for
difficult academic tasks increased, and performance increased because he was able
to develop relationships with children. Too few American schools do this. Even in
high school, where it is theoretically possible to teach the same child for multiple
years, teachers course assignments sometimes keep this from happening. A child
who takes math or a foreign language for 4 years might have a different teacher
each year because one teacher is assigned to freshmen and another teacher is
assigned to advanced students.
5. Facilitate transitions to new schools or teachers. If children must move from one school
to another, they should be helped to make connections with children, families, and
teachers as they transition. Two procedures that help are to place new students with the
same teacher their older siblings had and to place children with friends. Other
procedures might include hosting informal family nights with teachers at the school,
hosting school visits in the spring for children who will enter the new school in the fall,
and assigning an older student as a buddy to show the new student around.
6. Decrease transitions in and out of the classroom. In a single day, an elementary child
may go to a speech therapist, reading specialist, and counselor or other specialist.
When this coming and going is combined with the other teachers the child experiences
such as gym, music, art, and science, there are too many transitions. Ironically, highrisk children who have difficulty adapting to the classroom and most need stability tend
to spend the most time coming and going from the classroom. When there are several
transitioning children in a classroom, it can be disruptive to the students. When services
are delivered by many different specialists to high-risk children, their risk may actually
increase (Pianta 1999). Such a structure is designed to meet the academic needs of
children, but disregards their socioemotional needs. One possible solution is to have
specialists serve as in-classroom consultants to teachers, so that children stay in the
classroom. Some high schools attempt to eliminate classroom transitions for high-risk
adolescents with a school within a school approach, but this may be too late for
children disenfranchised from school.

attachment at school and academic achievement.
Conclusions
Nel Noddings (1992) argues that the first job of schools is to care for children. It is morally
and practically wrong to assert that schools should only concentrate on academic goals;
children do not learn academically if they are not cared for. All students want to learn,
although not necessarily the content they are asked to learn in school. Caring for children
prepares them to be receptive to learning such content. Children should feel safe in their

relationships with their teachersthey should be able to admit confusion, errors, and even a
dislike of the subject matter. Teachers should care for students even if they are not
interested in the subject the teacher is passionate about. Of course, teachers are more
attracted to children who share their passions for a topic, but all children, even those with
interests different from the teachers, must be valued and cared for. Noddings suggests that
teachers should avoid pernicious gossip about children in the lounge, know where their
students live, join them for lunch, and chat with them. She points out that while families use
mealtime as an important arena for relationship building, teachers seldom do.
Positive teacherstudent relationships may be particularly important for children at the
bottom of the achievement gap. Several of the studies reviewed above found that positive
effects were strongest for low-SES, low-achieving, and African American children. For
example, in the Hamre and Pianta (2001) longitudinal study, relationship problems with
their kindergarten teacher predicted maladjustment in junior high most strongly for boys,
African Americans, children with poor verbal ability, and children with initial behavior
problems. Vulnerable children who developed positive relationships with teachers were less
likely to develop later behavior problems at school. It may be more challenging for teachers
to establish secure relationships with low-SES children because low SES is related to
insecure parentchild attachment (e.g., NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 1997).
Disorganized attachment is almost twice as prevalent in low-SES than middle-SES children
(Lyons-Ruth et al. 1990). Perhaps this is because low SES is linked to a series of risk
factors such as low education, increased drug use, and lack of support from the father,
which are linked with less sensitive parenting (Tarabulsy et al. 2005). Yet, secure
attachment occurs in spite of poverty when parents are warm and accepting, not intrusive,
and do not use physical punishment (Barnett et al. 1998).
Establishing school bonding may be especially challenging for students who are in the
ethnic minority at their school. Adolescents tend to feel more attached to school when a
high proportion of students are their same ethnicity (M. K. Johnson et al. 2001). However,
ethnically segregated schools are not ideal for many reasons, including inequality of
education, so multi-ethnic schools may need to put forth special effort to ensure that all
students feel they belong.
Secure teacherstudent relationships may seem like a low priority in an era of high
stakes testing. However, childrens socioemotional well-being is linked to achievement.
Higher quality education is the result of healthy relationships from preschool to high
school. In a study of preschoolers, teacherstudent interaction was more predictive of
academic, language, and social skill development than other aspects of the preschool
fEduc Psychol Rev (2009) 21:141170
163
setting, such as teacherstudent ratio, curriculum, class size, and physical environment
(Mashburn et al. 2008). Among school-age children, the effect size of teacherstudent
relationships is large, larger than typical educational innovations or curriculum changes
(Cornelius-White 2007). This suggests that improving teacherstudent relationships could
be a particularly powerful way to improve achievement, particularly for at-risk groups.
Most of our recommendations are low cost because they simply require improved
relationships with children, rather than new curriculum or infrastructure. More importantly,
promoting attachment-like teacherstudent relationships and school bonding should be
given priority because it promotes childrens well-being.

Approaches to Early Childhood Education
Psychoanalyst, John Bowlby was the first person to describe ‘attachment’ and although it initially referred to the connection between a mother and child, we now know that attachment also plays a key role in early childhood education and care (ECEC).
In the ECEC context, secure bonds between educators and children help little ones to regulate their emotions and behaviours, develop social competencies, and venture confidently into the child care world, safe in the knowledge that a trusted adult has their back.
Healthy attachments support children’s play-based learning and lifelong learning, so let’s look at Bowlby’s theory of attachment, and see how educators and children can form secure attachments at ECEC.
What is Bowlby’s theory of attachment?
Attachment has been simply described as, ‘The bond that is formed between people as a result of their interactions,’ but Bowlby came up with his psychological theory of attachment when researching the extreme distress that infants experienced when separated from their parents.
He saw children crying, screaming and clinging when they wanted to avoid being separated from their parent, or when they saw them again, and came to the conclusion that these attachment behaviours were instinctive responses to the perceived threat of losing an attachment figure (someone who provides primary care, support and protection).
Attachment theory then developed as a framework for explaining attachment behaviours and helping us understand how children feel, in terms of security and insecurity.
R. Chris Fraley explains that Bowlby’s ‘attachment behavioural system’ asks whether an attachment figure is nearby, accessible and attentive:
If the child thinks they are, they’ll feel secure, loved and confident, and will behave in playful, exploratory and social ways.
If the child doesn’t think an attachment figure is available, they’ll feel anxious and will exhibit behaviours that can range from low-level visual searching to intense crying, screaming, clinging or avoidance of their adult.
What do different attachment relationships look like?
Attachment theory recognises that individual children will judge the availability of their attachment figure and regulate their behaviour in different ways, and research on Bowlby’s theory has identified three types of attachment relationships:
Secure relationships, where children are confident that their primary care-giver will be available, comforting and helpful if a scary situation happens,
Anxious-ambivalent relationships, where children aren’t sure whether their care-giver will be responsive or available, and
Avoidant relationships, where children have lost all confidence that their care-giver will help them (because the adult constantly rejects them when they’re seeking comfort/protection).
In early childhood, it’s particularly important that children know they have a parent or other adult who will provide care and protection on a predictable basis, and a safe haven in times of need.
Adults who are caring, consistent, sensitive and responsive help children to feel secure; and the good news is that attachment relationships are stable, but also flexible. They can change as a result of new experiences or ways of thinking, and strong early attachments have the power to shape a child’s social, emotional and cognitive development in positive ways.
Lady Gowrie Child Centre says children’s developmental outcomes depend on how well adults can relate to them and help them develop secure attachments, and quality early childhood educators provide a secure base that children can explore from and safely return to.
How do early childhood educators form secure attachments with young children?
Lady Gowrie says, ‘Children form attachments with the adults who are caring for them through regular day-to-day activities and routines and by experiencing their caregiver’s responses through those routines – such as feeding, bathing, dressing, playing, and so on.’
In the ECEC setting, they say:
Educators build and shape relationships with the children in their care by taking responsibility for improving relationships and encouraging positive interactions.
They help youngsters to develop a sense of self and of others by providing warm and caring interactions that support each child’s sense of self-worth, self-esteem and confidence.
They support under fives’ cognitive development by offering children interactions that help to ‘wire’ their brains and promote lifelong learning.
Educators also make children feel safe and secure, so they can focus their time and energy on play, exploration and learning, instead of negative feelings, like fear or stress.
Educators tailor their interactions to suit individual children, reading and responding to their signals, and being ‘emotional available’. This means they’re sensitive and responsive to children’s needs and help children to make sense of their emotions and cope with life’s challenges.
They partner with children’s families to learn about each child and support the development of secure attachments. For example, an educator might mirror home routines around soothing or feeding, so that new ECEC experiences feel familiar to a young child.
Educators model regulated behaviours that help children learn what’s expected of them, and they respond in a calm, consistent, predictable and supportive way in different situations.
If a challenging behaviour emerges, a quality educator will focus on the child’s need, rather than behaviour, and teach them how to better express this need. For example, if a child feels a need for connection and is acting in a disruptive, attention-seeking way, they’ll be taught to seek out an adult.
All in all, quality educators provide much more than just a shoulder to cry on. They carefully and consistently build secure attachments with children, and help youngsters to feel safe, listened to, and delighted in. Confidence grows, competencies develop, and the child care environment becomes a place of wonder, not worry, for little people.
