Alright, so I need to figure out what constitutes a hostile work environment. This seems important because it affects people's well-being at work, and it's something that employers need to be aware of and prevent. I don't want to make any mistakes here, so I should probably look up some authoritative sources to get a clear definition.

First, I should probably understand what a hostile work environment is not. Maybe it's just a stressful workplace or a place where people don't get along. But I think it's more than that. I recall that there are legal definitions for this, so perhaps starting with labor laws or employment law resources would be a good idea.

Let me consider making a search query to find out more about this. Maybe something like "definition of hostile work environment in law." That should give me some precise information.

Hostile work environment
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In United States labor law, a hostile work environment exists when one's behavior within a workplace creates an environment that is difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work in, due to illegal discrimination. [1] Common complaints in sexual harassment lawsuits include fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually-suggestive photos displayed in the workplace, use of sexual language, or off-color jokes.[2] Small matters, annoyances, and isolated incidents are usually not considered to be statutory violations of the discrimination laws. For a violation to impose liability, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to a reasonable person. An employer can be held liable for failing to prevent these workplace conditions, unless it can prove that it attempted to prevent the harassment and that the employee failed to take advantage of existing harassment counter-measures or tools provided by the employer. [3]
A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee quit in retaliation for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a union, or reported regulatory violations by management, and management's response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the complaining employee to a distant work location.
The United States Supreme Court stated in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. [4] that Title VII is "not a general civility code". Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual's employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe or pervasive.

Burdens of proof[edit]
Where a hostile environment is alleged, the legality of behaviors must be determined on a case by case basis. In the workplace, such a claim focuses on the working conditions that must be experienced by the victim as a condition of employment, rather than on tangible job changes. To establish whether the situation is actionable the "totality of circumstances" must be weighed with an eye to determining "that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment in that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment". [5]
Relation to other laws[edit]
In many United States jurisdictions, a hostile work environment is not an independent legal claim. That is, an employee could not file a lawsuit on the basis of a hostile work environment alone. Instead, an employee must prove they have been treated in a hostile manner because of their membership in a protected class, such as gender, age, race, national origin, disability status, and similar protected traits. [3] Importantly, the hostile work environment is gender neutral, that is, men can sexually harass men or women and women can sexually harass men or women.
Likewise, a hostile work environment can be considered the "adverse employment action" that is an element of a whistleblower claim or a reprisal (retaliation) claim under a civil rights statute. When an employee claims that a hostile work environment is an adverse employment action, the legal analysis is similar to the burdens of proof described above. However, to recover damages, the employee must also establish all other elements of the claim, such as that the employee engaged in protected conduct such as making a report of discrimination or reporting an employer's violation of law, and also establish that the employer created the hostile work environment, at least in part, because the employee engaged in the protected activity.

Hostile Work Environment
Modified date: December 22, 2019
What is a Hostile Work Environment?
A hostile work environment refers to an unstable or sometimes even dangerous work setting. In most cases, a hostile work environment exists when an employee experiences habitual workplace harassment at the hands of his or her co-workers or boss. The harassment becomes so debilitating that the victim fears going to work because of the oppressive, hostile or intimidating atmosphere spawned by the aggressors. A hostile work environment, as somewhat of a broad term, may also be defined as when an employer, boss or manager engages in a manner designed to make the employee quit or perform his or her job function in a poor manner.
Examples of Workplace Harassment:
Suppose an employee reports a safety violation while at work. The report is unheard and promptly sparks an injury. In response, the employee attempts to join a union where he or she can actively complain to upper level management about the problem at work. Following this, the company’s response is to put pressure on the employee so that he or she quits and ceases the whistleblowing actions. In this situation, the employee, in essence, frames or blackmails the employee by writing him or her up for work violations that weren’t’ broken, by reducing the employee’s hours or increasing them to impede productivity or to create conflicts with the employees out-of-work schedule.
Other ways to essentially force an employee’s hand through workplace harassment include the following: reduce the employee’s salary without merit, adjust his or her responsibilities to either underwhelm or overwhelm the individual, start rumors about the employee to create a rift among his or her co-workers, or perpetually make comments about the employee’s appearance or skill set. In essence, any reaction that prompts a company to create a hostile work environment is instituted to protect the company’s best interests or to disqualify the individual from receiving unemployment compensation.
Laws against Workplace Harassment:
Laws protecting against workplace harassment are instituted as anti-discrimination statutes. These regulations govern are; however, not a civility code. As a result, federal laws will not prohibit simple harassment, such as teasing, isolated incidents, offhand comments, or any remarks that are not extremely serious. Workplace harassment, as a broad term, will be enforced to the fullest extent if the conduct attached is objectively offensive to the point where it alters the conditions of the individual’s employment. These situations arise only if the workplace harassment culminates in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe to create a hostile workplace.

What Is a Hostile Work Environment?
Offered by Nilges Draher LLC
Understanding what does and doesn’t constitute illegal harassment
Work isn’t always pleasant. Nearly anyone who has been in the workforce for a few years has dealt with unfair bosses, difficult coworkers, personality conflicts, frustrating customers, poorly maintained workspaces, or other problems at work. Sometimes, you’ll hear employees describe these circumstances as a “hostile work environment.”
However, an unpleasant or uncomfortable workplace is not necessarily a hostile work environment in the legal sense. A difficult environment at work is usually a result of poor management or decision-making on the company’s part, but that is not illegal. To have a legal claim against your employer, your work environment must meet specific criteria to meet the definition of a hostile work environment.
If you suspect you’re in a hostile work environment, you need to know your rights – and take action to protect them. It’s best to discuss your situation with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible.
The key elements of a hostile work environment
Again, annoyances, rudeness, petty slights, and other ordinary conflicts in the workplace do not constitute a hostile work environment in themselves. To rise to the level of a hostile work environment, the harassing behavior in question must be unwelcome, pervasive, severe, and persistent. It must be meaningfully disruptive to the victim’s work. Finally, to have a legal claim against the employer, the behavior must be something the employer knew about and did not adequately address.
The legal definition of “harassment” at work
Illegal harassment in the workplace is unwelcome conduct based on membership in a protected class. At the federal level, protected classes include:
Race, color, or national origin
Religion
Sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity
Pregnancy
Disability
Genetic information, or
Older age (40 and up)
Federal law also prohibits harassment against employees in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge in good faith, participating in an investigation, or opposing employment practices they reasonably believe are discriminatory. Some states have established additional protected classes such as marital status or political affiliation.
Unlawful harassment doesn’t have to be committed by a supervisor or manager – the harasser could be a coworker, or even a non-employee such as a vendor or customer.
Unlawful harassment also doesn’t need to involve financial harm, such as loss of pay, or termination. It doesn’t have to involve poor performance reviews or loss of desirable work assignments.
What matters is that the unlawful conduct happens at work and the employer doesn’t take adequate measures to stop it.
What is “pervasive, severe, and persistent” conduct?
In general, a single incident does not rise to the level of a hostile work environment unless it is particularly extreme, such as assault. Usually, a hostile work environment is something that continues over a substantial period of time. Some examples of conduct that can lead to a hostile work environment include:
Offensive or inappropriate joking
Obstruction of movement within the office
Frequent comments about physical appearance
Forwarding inappropriate media through email or office messaging systems
Mocking or teasing on the basis of a protected characteristic
Unwelcome touching or violations of personal space
A hostile work environment is often sexual in nature – for instance, unwanted sexual advances or frequent discussion of sexual activities – but, again, this is not required to meet the legal definition. What is required is that the work environment becomes intimidating, offensive, and abusive, to the point where it interferes with work. Courts consider both the frequency and severity of the alleged harassment to determine whether it meets the legal definition of a hostile work environment.
Understanding liability in hostile work environment cases
If the harassment that creates a hostile work environment is committed by a supervisor and involves a negative employment action (such as termination or loss of wages), then the employer is automatically responsible – and must take reasonable, prompt action to prevent or correct the harassing behavior to avoid legal liability. An employer can also be held responsible for harassment by non-employees and non-supervisory employees if the employer knew or should have known about the harassment.
Either way, once the employer becomes aware (or should become aware) of a hostile work environment, it’s on the employer to promptly address it. How that plays out depends on the nature of the hostile work environment and the cause of the harassment. If a single employee is committing harassment, for instance, then addressing the situation may be as simple as disciplining or firing that employee. When the problem is the culture of a whole department or even the entire organization, resolving it may require much more significant change, such as creating new policies, conducting training, monitoring internal communications for harassing content, and even making structural changes to the organization itself.
Regardless, it’s the employer’s responsibility to address the problem, and they can face legal consequences if they don’t.
What to do if you’re in a hostile workplace
As with any legal matter, if you are in what you believe to be a hostile work environment, you need to document the behavior in question. Take note of each instance of harassing behavior: when and where it happened, who was involved, and who witnessed it.
Follow your company’s protocol for filing an official report with your human resources department. Remember, federal law protects you from retaliation for filing a complaint in good faith. Put your complaint in writing, submit it to the right person, and keep a copy for your records in case the employer later tries to claim they were not aware of the illegal behavior.
Again, you need to prove that your organization knew about the harassment and failed to act. Documenting your official report helps with this. If you can prove a management employee witnessed or was aware of the hostile environment, document that as well.
A key element of a hostile work environment claim is that the harassment was severe and pervasive enough to interfere with your ability to do your job. Gather any performance reviews or other work assessments that can help show a connection between the harassment and changes in job performance. In addition, take note of any ways the harassment has affected your physical or mental health.
Talk to an experienced employment law attorney today
The laws around hostile work environments are complex and not always intuitive for employees (or employers, for that matter). Only a lawyer with experience handling employment law cases in your state can assess the situation and determine whether you have legal recourse. Remember, talking to a lawyer isn’t necessarily adversarial and doesn’t mean you’re obligated to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your employer. It’s an opportunity to learn your rights, discuss your options, and work toward a solution.
Most employment lawyers offer free, confidential consultations, so you have little to lose by taking the time to talk to an attorney about your situation. If you suspect you’re in a hostile work environment, find an experienced employment law attorney in your area today.

What is a Hostile Work Environment?
By Antonoplos & Associates
Jun 23, 2021
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines the legal term “hostile work environment” as “unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.” The EEOC definition means that behavior, actions, or communication must be discriminatory in nature.
Thus, teasing, yelling, or isolated incidents—unless extremely serious—are not considered harassment. While these acts may create a toxic work environment, it does not meet the legal definition of a hostile one. A toxic work environment is never good, however, you are typically only able to take legal action from teasing or other verbal abuse if you are part of a protected class. Finally, though issues such as weight or appearance are not in any of the protected classes, if this verbal abuse is severe enough, you may still be able to bring forth a lawsuit.
Conduct that represents harassment:
Consistently disciplining an employee more harshly than other employees on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age;
Discussing sex acts or using sexually suggestive language;
Inappropriate sexual touching;
Racist or otherwise offensive jokes;
A boss taunting an employee for their religious beliefs;
Consistently using highly insensitive language;
Making unwanted comments about someone’s appearance;
And more.
Conduct that does not represent harassment:
A coworker who is rude or passive aggressive:
A supervisor who doesn’t take your ideas seriously:
A manager who yells constantly and sets unattainable goals or deadlines (with no underlying discrimination).
Is a Hostile Work Environment Illegal?
Workplace harassment is illegal if the person bringing the claim (1) reasonably believes that enduring the offensive conduct is a condition of continued employment or (2) if the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work environment to the reasonable person. One important note is that if an employee dealing with harassment knows that they could report the conduct to human resources and the conduct would stop, they would be less likely to win in a lawsuit.
Many people think that work place harassment is a federal law. Instead, harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Only protected classes can file a charge of discrimination under Title VII. Before going to court, an employee looking to file a lawsuit must report their case with the EEOC. If the EEOC investigates and decides not to pursue the case any further, the EEOC can issue a “right to sue” letter to the employee that they can use to file a case in federal court within 90 days of the date of the letter.
Another important note is that you typically only have 180 days to file a complaint with the EEOC after a given incident. However, in some cases, you will have 300 days to file a complaint.
The EEOC also makes it illegal for a reported employer to retaliate against an individual as payback for their reporting of the employer’s improper behavior. This could be by firing, demoting, additional harassing, or other forms of retaliation.
Employer’s Defense to Hostile Work Environment
Most employer’s strongest defenses of a hostile work environment claim is the Faragher-Ellerth defense. The Faragher-Ellerth defense requires the employer to prove that (1) they took all reasonable preventative and corrective measures to remedy the harassment; and (2) the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the employer’s harassment complaint reporting procedure set out in the employer’s anti-harassment policies.
Additionally, the employer must have in place an effective anti-harassment policy and complaint reporting procedure to be considered preventative.

Hostile work environment: defined and explained.
What is a hostile work environment?
April 20, 2015 Mike Ivancie, Esq.
*Potential client note, we are no longer accepting any new EEOC cases at this time.
In today’s Fast Legal Answers series, I’ll be defining and explaining what a “ hostile work environment ” is. I hear this phrase thrown around so much that I think many people don’t actually know what a hostile work environment actually is. Is it an unpleasant work environment? Is it an unbearable one? How does it relate to discrimination and protected classes?
After reading this article you will know the legal definition of a hostile work environment, and should have a better idea of what is, and what is not, legally recognized as a hostile work environment.
Hostile work environment and harassment
A hostile work environment is really just a specific form of harassment. The EEOC defines harassment as:
unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.
Essentially, harassment occurs when a person suffers consistent and unwanted, and objectively offensive, conduct at work as a result of their membership in a protected class.
Elements of a hostile work environment claim
To establish a claim of hostile environment harassment, a complainant (employee) must prove all of the following elements:
They belong to a statutorily protected class;
They were subjected to harassment in the form of unwelcome verbal or physical conduct involving that protected class;
The harassment complained of was based on his or her statutorily protected class;
The harassment affected a term or condition of employment and/or had the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the work environment and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and
There is a basis for imputing liability to the employer (it is fair to find the employer liable, they were on notice of the conduct and did nothing, etc.)
Failure to meet or prove all of the above elements will likely result in you losing your case.
Hostile work environment: Legal definition vs. common (mis)conception
I think the common conception of a hostile work environment is a work environment that is unpleasant, generally sucks, or that makes you unhappy. However, as you can see above not only must the environment be intimidating, hostile, and/or offensive, the hostility you are enduring must also be a result of your membership in a protected class. This means that if your boss is a jerk to everyone including you, you won’t have a hostile work environment claim–the harassment must be based on your membership in legally recognized protected class. To illustrate, your boss not liking you because you are fans of rival sports teams, is not actionable discrimination. This is because what team you are a fan of is not a protected class. However, if your boss treated you differently because of the color of your skin, and only used your different team alliances as a pretext, that would be considered discrimination.
How bad does it have to be to be a hostile or offensive work environment?
In determining when a working environment is hostile, factors to consider are the frequency of the alleged discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and if it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance. See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993); EEOC Enforcement Guidance, Harris. But the working environment must be objectively hostile. Harris, 510 U.S. at 22. This means that a reasonable person in your shoes would find the work environment hostile or abusive too. So, if your hostile work environment claim rests on the fact that your boss doesn’t say please and thank you whenever they talk to you–your claims will likely fail. A simple way to evaluate whether your claim passes this “reasonable person” test is to explain your working situation to friends or acquaintances, if they strongly agree that your work environment is hostile or unbearable then its likely it is objectively hostile.
Obviously, each case is different, and the EEOC recognizes that a “hostile work environment harassment takes a variety of forms, many factors may affect this determination, including: whether the conduct was verbal or physical, or both; how frequently it was repeated; whether the conduct was hostile and patently offensive; whether others joined in perpetrating the harassment.” Brew v. Holder, EEOC Appeal No. 0120090045 (2009).
It needs to be consistent and pervasive
Generally, a hostile work environment needs to be ongoing and pervasive, typically a single incident or isolated incidents of offensive conduct or remarks generally do not create an abusive environment.” Id .; EEOC Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment, N-915-050, No. 137 (March 19, 1990) (“A ‘hostile environment’ claim generally requires a showing of a pattern of offensive conduct.”).
Typically the “mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not affect the conditions of employment to a sufficiently significant degree to violate Title VII.” Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986). However, a limited number of highly offensive slurs or derogatory comments may in fact state a claim or support a finding of discrimination under Title VII. See, e.g., Yabuki v. Department of the Army, EEOC Request No. 05920778 (June 4, 1993) (single incident of verbal abuse and negative comment concerning Japanese people sufficient to constitute race and national origin discrimination); Brooks v. Department of the Navy, EEOC Request No. 05950484 (June 25, 1996) (three racially derogatory comments over a two-month period by an individual with a history of making such statements was sufficient to state a claim); McAllister v. Department of Defense, EEOC Request No. 05960416 (May 22, 1997) (a supervisor’s disparaging and racist comments to complainant, in conjunction with prior comments by the supervisor demeaning to other protected classes, was sufficient to justify an AJ’s finding of discrimination).
All these cases really just tell us that: it depends. But the more shocking the abuse or negative environment you have been subject to, the less duration or instances of exposure you will have to demonstrate. To put it more directly: as the harassment becomes more severe judge’s will require less instances of the harassment to support a finding of actionable discrimination. Additionally, physical violence, clearly offensive conduct, or group harassment will shift the balance in favor a conclusion of a hostile work environment.
Conclusion
A hostile work environment is much more than just an unpleasant workplace. While each case is different, generally you must make a showing of a persistent and offensive working environment that was generated as a result of your membership in a protected class. Ultimately, it is critical that you consult with an attorney early on if you think you have been subject to harassment or a hostile work environment because the deadline to report discrimination is only 45 days.

How much is my discrimination case worth? →

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got some information here from different sources about what constitutes a hostile work environment. Let's try to make sense of it all.

First, from Wikipedia, it says that a hostile work environment exists when someone's behavior at work makes it difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work there, especially due to illegal discrimination. It gives examples like fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually suggestive photos, using sexual language, or telling off-color jokes. It emphasizes that small matters or isolated incidents usually aren't considered violations, but the conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create an environment that's intimidating, hostile, or offensive to a reasonable person.

Also, it mentions that employers can be held liable if they fail to prevent such harassment, unless they can show they tried to prevent it and that the employee didn't take advantage of the preventive measures provided.

Another point is that a hostile work environment can be created when management acts to make an employee quit in retaliation for actions like reporting safety violations, getting injured, trying to join a union, or reporting regulatory violations.

The US Supreme Court case Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. stated that Title VII is not a general civility code, meaning that simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that aren't extremely serious aren't covered. The conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that's abusive.

Moving on to the next source from Employment Laws, it says that a hostile work environment is when an employee experiences habitual harassment from coworkers or bosses that's so debilitating that they fear going to work because of the oppressive atmosphere. It also mentions that it can be when an employer tries to force an employee to quit or perform poorly by engaging in certain behaviors.

Examples given include reducing hours, cutting salary without cause, changing responsibilities to overwhelm or underwhelm the employee, spreading rumors, or making comments about the employee's appearance or skills.

The laws against workplace harassment are anti-discrimination statutes, and it's not a civility code. So, federal laws don't cover simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents unless they're extremely serious.

For workplace harassment to be actionable, the conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive work environment.

The third source from Law.com talks about what constitutes a hostile work environment in legal terms. It explains that annoyances, rudeness, and other ordinary conflicts aren't enough; the harassment must be unwelcome, based on a protected characteristic, and severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive work environment.

Protected classes under federal law include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, and age (40 and up). Some states have additional protected classes.

The harassment doesn't have to be committed by a supervisor; it could be a coworker or even a non-employee like a vendor or customer.

The key is that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment and didn't take adequate steps to stop it.

The fourth source from AntonLegal.com provides the EEOC's definition: unwelcome conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. It emphasizes that teasing, yelling, or isolated incidents aren't considered harassment unless extremely serious.

It lists examples of conduct that can lead to a hostile work environment, such as offensive joking, obstruction of movement, frequent comments about physical appearance, unwanted touching, and mocking based on a protected characteristic.

It also explains that the employer is automatically responsible if a supervisor's harassment results in a negative employment action, like termination or loss of wages. For harassment by non-supervisors, the employer is responsible if they knew or should have known about it and didn't take prompt and appropriate action.

The fifth source from IvanCieLaw.com delves into the elements required to prove a hostile work environment claim:

1. Belonging to a protected class.

2. Being subjected to unwelcome harassment based on that protected class.

3. The harassment affecting a term or condition of employment or unreasonably interfering with work performance.

4. A basis for holding the employer liable (e.g., they knew or should have known about the harassment and didn't act).

It also clarifies that the work environment must be objectively hostile, meaning a reasonable person would find it intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

The severity and frequency of the conduct are crucial. A single incident usually isn't enough unless it's extremely severe. The more severe the harassment, the less need there is to show pervasive conduct.

Physical violence, clearly offensive conduct, or group harassment can more easily support a finding of a hostile work environment.

In conclusion, a hostile work environment is more than just a unpleasant workplace. It involves persistent, severe harassment based on a protected characteristic that creates an abusive work environment, and the employer knew or should have known about it but didn't take appropriate action.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A hostile work environment is a work setting where harassment based on a protected characteristic is severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive atmosphere, and the employer fails to take appropriate action to address it.}} \]
