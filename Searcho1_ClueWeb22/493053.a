I'm trying to understand why natural gas prices are going up. I don't know much about this topic, so I need to do some research. First, I should probably look into what factors affect natural gas prices in general. Maybe supply and demand play a big role? Or perhaps there are other elements like geopolitical tensions or economic indicators. I think starting with a basic understanding of how natural gas prices are determined would be a good approach.

Let me consider doing a web search to gather some information. I'll search for "factors affecting natural gas prices" or something similar. That should give me a overview of the main influences on natural gas pricing.

Factors affecting natural gas prices - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Natural gas explained Factors affecting natural gas prices
Natural gas prices are a function of market supply and demand
Increases in natural gas supply generally result in lower natural gas prices, and decreases in supply tend to lead to higher prices. Increases in demand generally lead to higher prices, and decreases in demand tend to lead to lower prices. In turn, higher prices tend to moderate or reduce demand and encourage production, and lower prices tend to have the opposite effects.
Three major supply-side factors affect prices:
Amount of natural gas production
Level of natural gas in storage
Volumes of natural gas imports and exports
Three major demand-side factors affect prices:
Variations in winter and summer weather
Level of economic growth
Availability and prices of other fuels
Because of natural gas supply infrastructure constraints and limitations in the ability of many natural gas consumers to switch fuels quickly, short-term increases in demand and/or reductions in supply may cause large changes in natural gas prices, especially during the wintertime.
Domestic natural gas production increased in recent years
The United States produces most of the natural gas that it consumes. Annual U.S. dry natural gas production generally increased from 2005 through 2019, and U.S. natural gas prices generally decreased during the same period and have been less volatile since 2010.

Economic growth can affect natural gas demand and prices
The strength of the economy influences natural gas markets. During periods of economic growth, increases in demand for goods and services from the commercial and industrial sectors may increase natural gas consumption. Economic-related increases in consumption can be particularly strong in the industrial sector, which uses natural gas as a fuel and a feedstock for making many products such as fertilizer and pharmaceuticals.
Severe weather can disrupt supply
Hurricanes and other severe weather can affect the supply of natural gas. Natural gas prices have been affected when hurricanes disrupted natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico as in 2005 with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In recent years, disruptions in Gulf of Mexico production tend to affect prices less than in the past because the share of total U.S. dry natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico has declined from about 25% in 2001 to 2% in 2020. Very cold weather can also disrupt natural gas production. If these supply disruptions occur when demand for natural gas is high, prices may increase more than expected.

Winter weather strongly influences residential and commercial demand
During cold months, natural gas demand for heating by residential and commercial consumers generally increases overall natural gas demand and can put upward pressure on prices. If unexpected cold or severe weather occurs, the effect on prices can intensify because supply is often unable to react quickly to short-term increases in demand. The effect of weather on natural gas prices may be greater if the natural gas transmission (pipeline) system is already operating at or near full capacity. Natural gas supplies in storage can help to cushion the impact of high demand during cold weather.
Hot summer weather can increase electric power demand for natural gas
High summer temperatures can have direct and indirect effects on natural gas prices. Hot weather tends to increase demand for air conditioning in homes and buildings, which generally increases the power sector's demand for natural gas. During high demand periods, natural gas prices on the spot market may increase sharply if natural gas supply sources are relatively low or constrained. In addition, increases in natural gas consumption by the electric power sector during the summer may lead to smaller-than-normal injections of natural gas into storage and to lower available storage volumes in the winter, which could affect prices.
Natural gas supplies held in storage play a key role in meeting peak demand
The level of natural gas in underground storage fields has a large influence on overall supply. Storage helps to meet seasonal and sudden increases in demand, which domestic production and imports might not otherwise meet. When demand is lower, storage absorbs excess domestic supply. Storage also supports pipeline operations and trading hub services. Levels of natural gas in storage typically increase from April through October, when overall demand for natural gas is lower. However, in recent years, injections of natural gas into storage have often continued into the first half of November. Levels of natural gas in storage typically decrease from November through March, when demand for natural gas for heating is generally high.
Competition with other fuels can influence natural gas prices
Some large-volume fuel consumers such as power plants and iron, steel, and paper mills can switch between natural gas, coal, and petroleum, depending on the cost of each fuel. When the costs of the other fuels fall, demand for natural gas may decrease, which may reduce natural gas prices. When the prices of competing fuels rise relative to the price of natural gas, switching from those fuels to natural gas may increase natural gas demand and prices. However, the capability of the U.S. manufacturing sector to switch fuels has declined in recent decades. Favorable natural gas prices in recent years have contributed to increased natural gas use by the electric power sector.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
What are the major factors affecting natural gas prices?
Natural gas prices are mainly a function of market supply and demand. Because there are limited short-term alternatives to natural gas as a fuel for heating and electricity generation during periods of high demand, changes in supply or demand over a short period may result in large price changes. Prices themselves often act to balance supply and demand.
Factors on the supply-side that affect prices include natural gas production, net imports, and storage inventory levels. Increases in supply tend to pull prices down, while decreases in supply tend to push prices up. Increases in prices tend to encourage natural gas production and imports, and sales from natural gas storage inventories. Declining prices tend to have the opposite effects.
Factors on the demand-side include weather (temperatures), economic conditions, and petroleum prices. Cold weather (low temperatures) increases demand for heating, while hot weather (high temperatures) increases demand for cooling, which increases natural gas demand by electric power plants. Economic conditions influence demand for natural gas, especially by manufacturers. Demand may be moderated by petroleum fuel prices, which may be an economical substitute for natural gas for power generators, manufacturers, and large building owners. Higher demand tends to lead to higher prices, while lower demand can lead to lower prices. Increases and decreases in prices tend to reduce or increase demand.

6 Factors Affecting Natural Gas Prices (And 1 That’s Raising Them Now)
Impact of Weather

Seasonal weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes, can have a great influence on natural gas production. This supply side factor forces refineries to slow or shut down production during periods when weather events pose a threat to workers and facilities.
Hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast in the mid-2000s forced natural gas companies to halt domestic operations in the area for close to a year (from summer 2005 through summer 2006). The resulting slowdown cost the country four percent of its normal total natural gas output over that period.
Weather that impacts travel, including blizzards and tornadoes, can also affect pricing due to artificial scarcity caused by delayed deliveries of natural gas. Milder temperatures during seasons of traditionally higher natural gas usage — fall and winter — can mean lower prices because consumers use their home heating systems less. Hot weather during the summer can jump-start natural prices because 30 percent of power plants in the United States use natural gas to generate electricity. When more homeowners turn their air conditioners on, natural gas prices could go up.
Economic Growth
As the economy grows, so does the price of natural gas. In a strong economy that shows good growth, particularly in industrial and commercial markets, demand for this resource spikes. Companies experience an increase in demand for their goods and services, which in turn raises the want level on natural gas as a power source. As more economic sectors demand natural gas, the price invariably increases. A variety of industries use natural gas that consumers may not realize.
Pharmaceutical companies use butane, ethane, and propane to make a myriad of consumer health products. Industrial companies use natural gas to make cleaner-burning fuel sources, including gasoline (methanol). It also has a use in the farming industry as a part in fertilizer. Heating and cooling systems — particularly infrared heating units used by the metals industry — in commercial areas also use natural gas. These devices give an environmentally friendly and efficient means to heat and cool water and other materials.
Competition Among Resources
Use of natural resources among energy companies and industrial operations changes regularly depending on availability and price. Typically, these companies look to leverage the cheapest natural fuel source to control their own production cost. Because of the inter-related nature of fuel markets — oil, natural gas, and coal — swings in interest to any one of them drives down the price for the others. For example, a shift by electricity companies to coal usually lowers the demand for natural gas and oil. As demand falls, so does price. Because of large volume associated with natural resource consumption, even a small decrease or increase in price can have a noticeable effect on demand.
As of 2013, utility companies in the United States use natural gas to generate 27 percent of all electricity used by homes and businesses alike. Coal, as of the same year, still generates a higher percentage of total electricity in the nation at 39 percent. The use of natural gas by power companies, however, is on the rise. This trend is occurring, in part, because of the fuel’s low-carbon footprint and its domestic availability — most notably in the Marcellus Formation.
Crude Oil Price Fluctuations
Crude oil prices can influence the use and price of natural gas in ways that coal or other home heating oils do not. When the price per barrel of crude oil rises, so does the cost of the products manufacturers and refineries produce from it, including gasoline. When gasoline prices increase, consumers adjust their travel plans and buying strategies. They may go on fewer vacations, take shorter trips, and spend less when they do.
Businesses that use petroleum products may also cut back on gasoline usage to control overhead. Natural gas is an attractive alternative as many machines that run on petroleum can also use natural gas.
Natural gas occurs in two varieties: associated and non-associated gas. Crude oil refineries extract dissolved associated natural gas from crude oil as a byproduct of the purification process. An increase in demand for crude oil can increase the cost of production, which increases the price for crude oil as well as natural gas refined along with it. Increased drilling to find new sources of crude oil can also drive up the cost, which influences the price of associated natural gas.
Natural Gas Storage
The cost of maintaining storage facilities for natural gas can influence its end price for the consumer. Known as storage levels, these underground field locations are a key link in the supply chain for delivering natural gas to utility companies, businesses, and homes throughout the year. An uptick in fees associated with storage levels can cause a corresponding increase in natural gas prices. Supply and demand also influences storage needs. A lower demand for natural gas means more time in storage, which causes costs associated with maintaining storage levels to rise.
Now: Natural Gas Supply
Reserves of natural gas kept in storage levels across the United States have the greatest current influence over natural gas prices. Without adequate reserves to meet demand during peak usage months, increased scarcity spurs natural gas companies to push production to refine more usable gas.
As production rises higher, associated resource costs, including worker wages, machinery upkeep, and fuel, increase, as well. Consumers and businesses feel the effects in the form of higher natural gas prices. Natural gas proved reserves fell by 7 percent in the United States by 7 in 2012 on the back of low prices. In 2013, the price of natural gas per MMBtu (British Thermal Unit) shot up to over $3.60.
As the competition among industrial companies to find the most cost-effective fuel increases, so does the interest in natural gas as a long-term solution. How the United States manages its natural gas reserves will tell the true story of whether businesses can adopt this strategy or leave it for cheaper alternatives.

8 Factors That Affect the Natural Gas Market – Spark Energy
8 Factors That Affect the Natural Gas Market
In some parts of the country, natural gas is pretty common. It powers heating systems, electricity generation, appliances and vehicles among other things. Residential, commercial and industrial entities all rely on natural gas day in and day out.
The thing is, the natural gas market is always changing. The production and prices fluctuate constantly, influenced by a number of outside factors. At the center of it all is supply and demand. The more people need natural gas the more it will be produced and the higher the cost will be. Changes in the supply line can also impact pricing in the market.
Understand the carbon-neutral natural gas solutions offered by Spark Energy.
Factors Affecting Natural Gas Demand
Natural gas companies pay careful attention to the demand for their product. Factors that influence the need for natural gas can be short-term or long-term.
Time of Year
In the winter demand for natural gas is at an all time high because the majority of U.S. homes have heating systems that use it as a power source. If temperatures remain low the increased demand could last into early Spring. Demand gets so high in winter, the U.S. imports natural gas from Canada, Trinidad and a few other countries. The hot weather in mid-summer also increases demand at electric power plants. Currently, about 25% of electricity is generated by natural gas, and that percentage is increasing.
Health of the Economy
When people are doing well financially they are a little less conservative with their energy consumption. During economic downturns and recessions people and businesses scale back their consumption and demand goes down. This is most notable in the industrial sector. Unemployment, the housing market, the stock market and manufacturing indexes can all indicate natural gas demand.
Petroleum and Coal Prices
Petroleum is an alternative of natural gas for power production. If the price of petroleum drops the demand shifts away from natural gas. The same is true for coal to a lesser degree since coal-fired power plants are being retired. Some experts predict the adoption of renewable energy sources will have an impact as well.
Nuclear Plant Operation
This factor is one that you may not think about but can have a big impact on the natural gas market. When nuclear plants are down and not working more natural gas is needed to produce electricity.
Factors Affecting Natural Gas Supply
Anything that aids or disrupts the production, storage or import of natural gas is a factor that affects supply.
Weather
Natural gas production is always going to be influenced by the weather since the job requires pulling resources out of the earth. Normal rainstorms can slow down workers out in the oil fields, but big storms can be majorly disruptive. A hurricane or tornado can cause serious damage to equipment, make working conditions unsafe and derail the supply chain.
Production
This one is pretty straightforward. The level of production is the most direct factor affecting supply. Typically, production ramps up when demand is high or reserves are low.
Storage
Underground storage facilities make it possible to supply natural gas year round. When there’s an abundance of natural gas it’s stored for later use when supply is low or demand is high. The storage level and cost associated with storing natural gas impacts price, which can in turn affect demand. The Energy Information Agency releases a weekly report highlighting how much natural gas is in government storage facilities.
Civil Unrest/War
In the U.S. we produce a lot of our own natural gas, but global factors can affect the market as a whole. Civil unrest at home or in a country we import and export from can be a factor in supply.
Thanks to new drilling techniques, additional sources of electricity and more conscious energy consumers the U.S. is producing slightly more natural gas on an annual basis than we consume. Right now natural gas rates are very reasonable for consumers.

Learn About Natural Gas Rates
Natural gas prices are based on supply and demand in the market. This means that changes in supply or demand for natural gas can result in a change in prices for this resource in order to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium. Fluctuations in the market can directly impact your natural gas rates so it’s important to understand what factors contribute to changes in natural gas prices.
Supply and demand impacts prices
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), there are four supply side factors and three demand side factors that may affect natural gas prices.
During severe weather it is common to see disruption in the market. During such high demand period, storage inventories of natural gas may be below-average causing pressure on prices. Also during inclement weather natural gas production could be shut down causing a shortage of supply and increased prices.
Overall, increases in natural gas supply typically lead to lower prices, whereas decreases in supply tend to result in increased natural gas rates.
Supply factors that may affect prices
Variations in the amount of natural gas produced
Volume of gas imported and/or exported
Delivery constraints
Amount of gas in storage facilities
Demand factors that may affect prices
The economy
Seasonal weather changes
Oil prices
Components of natural gas rates
Rates for residential consumers include two main costs: commodity costs and transmission and distribution costs.
The commodity cost is the cost of the resource itself.
The transmission and distribution cost is the cost to move the natural gas from where the resource is produced through pipelines to a utility company and then from the utility to a customer’s home.
In addition to these costs, a number of taxes are also included in rates.
Secured-rate plans
Many consumers want stability when it comes to rates and monthly bills. Due to supply and demand and the factors listed above, however, price changes are inevitable. One way to protect your rates from monthly changes is to sign up for a fixed rate supply service plan. Seasonal temperature changes and the market won’t change your rates, therefore you can better predict your bill and not worry over the market or weather conditions.
As demand for this natural resource continues to increase, prices may continuously change. Stay informed of the factors that affect prices so you know when to expect rate changes.

Alright, so I've got this information from these documents. Let's see what they say about factors affecting natural gas prices.

From Doc 1, which is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), it looks like natural gas prices are mainly determined by supply and demand. That makes sense. So, if there's more demand for natural gas, prices go up, and if there's more supply, prices go down. It also mentions that supply-side factors include production, storage levels, and imports/exports. Demand-side factors include weather, economic growth, and prices of other fuels.

Doc 2 is another FAQ from EIA, reiterating that prices are a function of supply and demand. It also emphasizes that because there are limited alternatives to natural gas for heating and electricity generation, sudden changes in demand can lead to large price fluctuations.

Doc 3 from Worldwide Power Products lists six factors affecting natural gas prices and mentions one that's currently raising prices. The factors include weather, economic growth, competition among resources, crude oil price fluctuations, natural gas storage, and now, natural gas supply.

Doc 4 from Spark Energy talks about eight factors affecting the natural gas market, including time of year, health of the economy, petroleum and coal prices, nuclear plant operations, weather, production levels, storage, and civil unrest or war.

Doc 5 from Just Energy explains that natural gas rates consist of commodity costs and transmission/distribution costs, and that prices are based on supply and demand.

So, overall, it seems that supply and demand are the primary drivers, with various factors influencing both supply and demand.

Now, to answer the question "why are natural gas prices going up?", I need to identify which of these factors are currently causing an increase in demand or a decrease in supply, leading to higher prices.

Looking back at Doc 3, it mentions that "now: natural gas supply" is the factor with the greatest current influence over natural gas prices. It says that lower reserves lead to higher production needs, which in turn increases costs and thus prices.

But I need to verify if this is still accurate or if there are other factors at play currently.

Maybe I should look for more recent information or news about natural gas prices.

Why Are Natural Gas Costs Rising?
Posted 
                                        on Wednesday, October 27, 2021
Natural gas customers across the country will likely experience increased heating costs this winter, due to a rise in natural gas market prices. While there is no single answer to why market prices are up, there are a few key factors.
Natural Gas Supply
Low supplies of a commodity tend to drive market prices higher. Current supplies of natural gas are lower than normal because of long and short-term factors. Low market prices for crude oil over the past decade have limited investment in new oil drilling sites, cutting down on the amount of gas produced. Further COVID-related economic signals also limited investment in natural gas production.
Meanwhile, supplies of gas in the U.S. have also been depleted by 2021 weather events such as the February extreme winter storm across the Midwest and South. The summer was very hot in the West, which meant more gas than normal was needed to produce electricity. And fall hurricanes forced the Gulf of Mexico’s gas output offline. In addition, European countries are experiencing a gas shortage, so exports from the United States are up.
Tracking Historic Trends
U.S. natural gas prices have been at historic lows since hydraulic fracturing (fracking) unlocked new supplies over a decade ago. Natural gas heating customers have benefited from the low natural gas market prices during that time.
Last winter, normal gas prices were around $3 per unit. Average prices were much higher in the early 2000s. Experts aren’t sure if we are experiencing a short-term price increase in 2021 or a return of higher prices closer to historic norms.
CFU will continue to control the costs we can, protect customers as much as possible from market volatility and keep customers informed about the impact of energy markets on utility bills.

Natural gas prices moved past $5.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in trading on Wednesday to finish the day at $5.46. That was the highest settlement since February 2014. While the contract pulled back slightly from that level on Thursday and Friday’s session to settle at $5.105 per MMBtu, it still registered the fourth weekly climb in a row. As a matter of fact, natural gas prices have more than doubled year to date and a staggering 250% off the 25-year lows from June 2020.
Let’s discuss the most important factors shaping the commodity’s stunning rally.
Slow Restoration of Hurricane-Affected Operations: A large part of natural gas’ recent bull run has been supported by hurricane-curtailed supplies. Ida — the year’s ninth named storm — made landfall in Louisiana on Aug 29, resulting in copious rainfall, catastrophic wind damage, and power losses for hundreds of thousands of customers. This was followed by Hurricane Nicholas earlier this month. In particular, the extreme weather events significantly disrupted natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and some of it remains offline. The platform shutdowns have dragged down daily production to around 90 Bcf of late when an average of around 93 Bcf is needed to balance the demand.
Late-Season Hot Weather: Domestic usage has been strong over the 2021 summer months as record-breaking heat in most parts of the country led to a higher power burn (or cooling demand) for the fuel. Besides, the latest models are anticipating lofty temperatures for the remainder of September, which will keep on driving the commodity’s consumption above normal levels.
Strong LNG Export Demand: Shipments of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and higher prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Data from the Energy Information Administration’s ("EIA") suggests that over the past six years (2015-2020), exports from America surged from 28,381 million cubic feet to 2,389,838 million cubic feet – a record high. Most analysts believe that deliveries appear poised for further gains this year on surging consumption in Europe, Asia and Latin America, especially as we head into winter. The circumstances are particularly dire in Europe where gas supply is running low with the need for steady refill from U.S. ahead of the heating season.
Pre-Winter Supply Crunch: As a result of all the above-mentioned factors, current natural gas stocks — at 3,006 billion cubic feet (Bcf) — are 595 Bcf (16.5%) below the 2020 level at this time and 231 Bcf (7.1%) less than the five-year (2016-2020) average. In fact, working gas in U.S. storage currently sits at its lowest level for this time of year since 2018 going into the peak demand season.
Final Words
Overall, given natural gas’ fundamental set-up, prices are expected to stay strong. The upward trend should aid gas-weighted producers like Cabot Oil & Gas COG, SilverBow Resources SBOW, Range Resources RRC and Comstock Resources CRK, while LNG exporter Cheniere Energy LNG is also primed for growth. Cabot, Range, Comstock and SilverBow sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Cheniere carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Q&A: What’s Up with Natural Gas Prices?
Mark Green
Posted November 3, 2021
Natural gas prices around the world have risen over the past few months, in some places reaching record levels. In Europe and Asia, prices have hovered near $35 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu), more than four times their long-term averages and equivalent to more than $200 per barrel of crude oil. U.S. natural gas prices have also risen, though much more modestly, hovering around $5/MMBtu the past few months and even briefly rising above $6/MMBtu.
Even with the recent increase, the U.S. continues to have the lowest natural gas prices among the world’s major users. The fact that the U.S. is the world’s largest natural gas producer and has ample domestic production has largely insulated U.S. consumers from global price spikes. Still, price increases have been noted by consumers and businesses alike, especially heading into the winter heating season when natural gas demand hits its peak.
Rapidly rising global demand for natural gas over the past decade has been driven by its versatility – possessing unique attributes for power generation, advantages as a heating and cooking fuel and its key role in the production of cement, fertilizer, glass and many other processes. Natural gas has a relatively low emissions profile, with about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal. The use of natural gas in place of coal fosters even greater reductions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. For all those reasons, natural gas is in high demand.
Below, in the first of two Q&A blogs with Dustin Meyer, API vice president of Natural Gas Markets, explains what has caused natural gas prices to increase around the world and in the U.S.
Q: Why are natural gas prices rising globally?
A: There are many reasons, and different regions of the world have different dominating factors. Let’s just say what we’ve seen is a rare confluence of events that could be deemed a “perfect storm” for putting upward pressure on global natural gas prices.
What we’ve seen recently is that global demand has risen along with the economic recovery from the pandemic. After an anomalous 2020, this year represents a return to a decade-long historical trend of strong global demand growth for natural gas. Yet, while demand has risen, global gas supply has been largely flat, which puts upward pressure on prices. And across nearly every demand region, a number of individual factors have combined to leave global markets quite tight.
Look at China – long the world’s largest driver of natural gas demand growth. This year China’s natural gas demand has increased by about 20% year-on-year, which is stunning. In South America, low hydropower output has led to increased regional gas demand and more upward pressure on prices. In Northwest Europe, unexpectedly low offshore wind production in August and September increased demand for gas in the power sector, putting upward pressure on prices.
All this comes after both Europe and Asia experienced a colder than average winter followed by a warmer than average summer. Both increased natural gas demand and consequently left gas storage at multi-year lows—another key contributor to high prices.
In contrast to the U.S., many of these regions are heavily dependent on natural gas imports and have relatively little domestic production. For example, European natural gas production, from Norway and the Netherlands, has continued to fall this year, and Russia – Europe’s largest gas supplier – diverted some of its production to refill domestic storage instead of increasing flows to Europe. More upward pressure on prices.
Finally, natural gas often competes against coal in power generation, which some regions switch back to when gas prices increase. However, global coal prices have also risen sharply this year.
This is the 30,000-foot view. The result is that market dynamics are stretching in advance of meeting peak demand this winter. Because of this, there’s a lot of upward pressure on heating and electricity costs and an especially cold winter could present risk of physical shortages in countries that lack secure supplies.

Watch on
Q: Why are natural gas prices rising in the U.S.?
A: As I mentioned, natural gas prices in the United States remain far below global prices, and the U.S. continues to have the lowest natural gas prices among major consuming regions in the world. Still, U.S. prices have increased – especially compared to last year’s pandemic-driven record-low prices.
For the past two months, U.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices have averaged $5.30/MMBTU compared to a $3.11/MMBTU 10-year average and a $3.22/MMBTU winter average. U.S. natural gas prices have risen in recent months due to a cold 2020-21 winter, persistently strong power sector demand during a warmer than average summer, weak hydropower output in the western U.S., a busier-than-usual nuclear maintenance schedule and relatively modest new production growth. All have contributed to lower gas storage levels, which is a key indicator heading into peak winter demand.
Typically, higher prices could spur more natural gas production and/or less demand in the power sector. However, what we’ve seen is U.S. gas production remaining largely flat as producers grappled with the workforce and supply-chain limitations that have impacted so many industries and paid down debt.
Further, gas demand in the power sector has remained relatively strong despite high prices due to hot summer weather keeping electricity demand elevated, and reduced fuel switching because of higher coal prices and significant plant retirements in recent years.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, many Americans could see higher gas and power bills this winter though they may be somewhat insulated by utility hedging programs and various state consumer protection mechanisms. The EIA expects U.S. natural gas prices to return closer to average levels after winter as demand falls and production ramps up. Further, the EIA continues to expect U.S. natural gas prices to remain low in the long-term.
Q: What's the role of policy, including climate policy, in what’s happening?
A: Every country is different, but at least in the U.S., it’s a little difficult to draw an immediate connection between current market dynamics and specific existing policies. There are definitely some regions of the country – the Northeast, for example – which routinely have faced higher natural gas prices due to state-level policy restrictions on building much-needed gas infrastructure.
Still, the overall situation is a good reminder of the importance of remaining energy independent as opposed to relying on imports. It wasn’t that long ago that the U.S. was projected to be the world’s largest gas importer, but that’s changed dramatically over the past decade thanks to the shale revolution (we’re actually now among the world’s largest gas exporters).
Retaining this advantage requires prudent energy policymaking that recognizes the importance of domestic production and the challenge of meeting energy demand in a reliable, affordable way.

Natural Gas Price Fluctuations - What Causes Them? - EnergyWatch
What Causes Natural Gas Price Fluctuations?
Anyone who follows energy prices knows first-hand how volatile natural gas prices can be. Since March 2016, prices have fluctuated from a low of $1.639/MMBtu on 3/3/16 to a high of $3.93/MMBtu on 12/28/16, a swing of $2.291 or 140% from low to high. But why exactly does the price of natural gas move up and down so frequently?
The short answer is that natural gas price fluctuations are a function of market supply and demand. The alternatives to natural gas are limited, particularly in the short-term. This means that any change in the supply or demand for natural gas, even over short periods, can result in significant price changes.
Supply-side factors
As a non-renewable energy source, the price of natural gas is determined primarily by supply levels. If supply is restricted for whatever reason (while demand remains the same), prices will increase. If there is a surplus in supply and plenty of natural gas in storage (again, while demand remains constant), prices may decrease. The supply of natural gas can change for the following reasons:
US natural gas production. Nearly all of the natural gas we consume comes from domestic sources. In the last decade, natural gas production has increased dramatically thanks to more efficient and cost-effective drilling techniques and the shale revolution.
US oil production. Additionally, as domestic oil drilling increases, “associated gas” increases as well (i.e. gas that comes up with oil).
Underground storage levels. When demand is weak, excess gas produced or imported is stored in underground storage fields. If storage levels are high when demand increases, stored gas can meet demand and help to keep prices stable.
Demand-side factors
There is only so much natural gas available. That means changes to demand levels will affect price, too. If demand increases, suppliers can increase the price. On the other hand, should demand decrease, prices may fall, too. The demand for natural gas can fluctuate due to:
The weather. The colder it is, the more people switch on their heating. When it’s hotter, however, the demand for air conditioning and other forms of cooling increases which also increases the demand for natural gas as power plants need more fuel.
LNG Exports. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are expected to increase through 2021. The Sabine Pass facility and 4 additional export facilities will be operational by 2021, with an export capacity of 9.2 bcf per day (for reference, total daily demand in US is about 70 bcf/d).
Exports to Mexico. Exports to Mexico have doubled since 2009 and are expected to increase through 2020 as additional pipelines come online.
Economic conditions. The strength of the economy has a significant impact on natural gas prices. When there is economic growth, increased demand from consumers and manufacturers can lead to price rises and even higher production levels. Naturally, weak economies and recessions will have the opposite effect and can cause lower prices.
Alternative fuel prices. The cost of other fuel alternatives, specifically coal and petroleum, can impact demand levels for natural gas. If the price of alternative fuels spike, demand for natural gas, which will be comparatively cheaper, can increase. If the price of fuel alternatives fall, however, then consumers may switch to cheaper alternatives and the demand for natural gas will decrease.
The price of natural gas is a major factor in electricity power pricing due to increased reliance on natural gas-fired generators, rather than nuclear, coal, and oil-powered alternatives.

Host of reasons, including economic recovery and geopolitics, behind trend
This is supposed to be an off season. Winter is yet to set in. But natural gas prices soared over the past few months, especially in Europe. The price of natural gas in Europe is now six times higher than what it was last year. Across the continent, natural gas inventories are falling. On Wednesday, the benchmark Dutch gas futures price jumped 40% in the morning trade to touch €162.13 a megawatt-hour, an eight-year high, but reversed course after Russian President Vladimir Putin assured Europe of supplies . But even after the day’s fall, gas prices in Europe remained twice as high as they were a month earlier. And on Friday, prices started rising again. What’s driving up the prices?

Supply constraints
A host of reasons, from economic recovery to geopolitics, are attributed to the price rise. Global energy demand fell last year when economies slipped into COVID-induced lockdowns. When growth returned this year, especially to Asian economies, demand shot up and energy producers struggled to meet the growing demand, pushing up prices. Even in the U.S., the world’s largest natural gas producer, prices rose from $1.7 per million British thermal units on March 31 to $6.3 per mBtu on October 5. Europe, which is heavily dependent on imports to meet its energy demand, was particularly hit hard.
As part of Europe’s shift towards cleaner energy, many countries had moved away from coal to gas to produce electricity. This increased Europe’s reliance on gas. On the other side, the continent’s natural gas production has shrunk over the years, as many countries shut down production fields over environmental concerns. If Europe’s natural gas production (excluding Russia) was about 300 billion cubic metres in 2005, it fell to less than 200 bcm in 2021, according to Rystad Energy. Norway, Europe’s main producer of natural gas, has seen its production shrink from 117.6 bcm in 2015 to 105.3 bcm in 2021. This has left Europe largely dependent on Russia.
Energy geopolitics
As prices shot up amid growing worldwide demand and falling production in Europe, supplies from Russia via a pipeline that passes through Ukraine and Poland also shrank, which made the situation worse. Russia has built another gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will take Russian gas directly to Germany bypassing Ukraine and Poland, whose governments are critical of the Kremlin. But supplies to Europe through Nord Stream 2 are yet to start as the pipeline is awaiting approval from European authorities.
In the past when Europe’s energy demand shot up, Russia had stepped up supplies. But this year, Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled energy giant that supplies about 35% of Europe’s gas requirements, has booked less additional exports than the traders wanted, adding pressure on supplies. The International Energy Agency said this week Russian exports to Europe this year were lower than they were in 2019. This has fuelled speculation that Mr. Putin is using the energy crunch in Europe to get approval from the EU for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several countries in Europe as well as the United States remain critical of the pipeline, which they say would help Russia enhance its leverage over the continent and would also allow Russia to economically punish Ukraine and Poland. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told the BBC on Thursday any attempts by Russia to exploit the crisis would backfire.
Putin’s assurance
The Kremlin has dismissed such criticism, saying Russia has no role in the energy crunch. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin said the amount of gas flowing through the operational pipeline is set to exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom’s contract with Ukraine. He also said Russia could “reach another record of deliveries of our energy resources to Europe, including gas”. This temporarily calmed the markets.
But Mr. Putin didn’t say how Russia was going to step up supplies — through the existing pipeline or Nord Stream 2? Russian officials have already said Gazprom can send more gas to Europe if Nord Stream 2 comes online quickly. It is to be seen if additional supplies would be tied to a quick approval for the pipeline. Furthermore, the Russian domestic gas market also remains tight. Inventories are running low, and winter is coming, which would shoot up demand constraining Russia’s export capacity. And demand is rising not only in Europe and the Americas, but also in Asia. Coal shortages in India and China could drive up prices of natural gas further.

Okay, so I have some recent information on why natural gas prices are going up. From the articles I've read, it seems like there are multiple factors at play here.

First, global demand for natural gas has been increasing rapidly over the past decade due to its versatility and lower emissions compared to other fossil fuels. It's used for power generation, heating, cooking, and in industrial processes. So, there's a lot of demand for it.

Now, looking at the global picture, it seems like several regions are facing supply constraints. For example, in Europe and Asia, natural gas prices have skyrocketed because these regions are heavily dependent on imports, and their domestic production is declining. In Europe, natural gas production has been decreasing, and Russia, which is a major supplier, hasn't been increasing exports as much as needed.

There's also mention of a "perfect storm" of events contributing to the price increase. This includes a colder than usual winter last year, followed by a warmer than usual summer, which has led to lower storage levels. Plus, there have been disruptions in supply due to hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is a significant production area.

In the U.S., although prices have increased, they are still relatively low compared to other parts of the world. The U.S. is the largest producer of natural gas and has abundant supplies, especially thanks to shale gas production. However, even in the U.S., prices have gone up due to higher demand from the power sector and lower storage levels heading into the winter.

One interesting point is the role of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The U.S. has become a major exporter of LNG, and increased exports can affect domestic prices. If more gas is being exported, less is available for domestic use, which can drive up prices.

Also, there's the issue of infrastructure. Some regions, like the Northeast in the U.S., have restrictions on building new gas pipelines, which can lead to localized price spikes during times of high demand.

Policy and politics seem to play a role as well. For instance, Russia's gas giant Gazprom hasn't been increasing exports to Europe as much as some would like, leading to speculation that Russia is using the energy crunch for political leverage, possibly to get approval for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

Lastly, the shift towards cleaner energy sources is also a factor. As countries move away from coal and towards natural gas for power generation, the demand for gas increases. However, this transition needs to be managed carefully to avoid such price volatility.

So, in summary, the current spike in natural gas prices is due to a combination of factors: strong global demand, supply constraints in key regions, infrastructure limitations, political dynamics, and the energy transition away from coal.
