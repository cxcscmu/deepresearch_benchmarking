Alright, I need to figure out what role women played in the struggle against apartheid. I don't know much about this topic, so I should probably start by understanding what apartheid was.

Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It was a policy implemented by the National Party government, which came to power in 1948, and it enforced racial separation and discrimination against non-white people, particularly black Africans.

So, women were part of the resistance against this unjust system. But what exactly did they do? I need to find out about their roles and contributions.

Maybe I should look up some key women who were involved in the anti-apartheid movement. Names like Winnie Mandela and Albertina Sisulu come to mind. I think they were both important figures in the struggle.

Let me think about Winnie Mandela first. She was the wife of Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for many years for his opposition to apartheid. Winnie Mandela herself was also imprisoned and harassed by the authorities. She was known for her activism and her support for the ANC, the African National Congress, which was the main anti-apartheid organization.

Albertina Sisulu was another prominent woman in the struggle. She was married to Walter Sisulu, who was also a key figure in the ANC. Albertina Sisulu was an activist in her own right, participating in protests and organizing resistance activities. She was also arrested and detained several times for her involvement.

I should also consider the broader context. Were there other women who played significant roles in the anti-apartheid movement? Maybe some who aren't as well-known internationally but were important locally.

Perhaps I should look into women's organizations that were involved in the struggle. I recall that there were women's leagues affiliated with the ANC and other political groups. These organizations likely played a crucial role in mobilizing women and coordinating their efforts in the resistance.

Another angle to consider is the specific issues that women faced under apartheid and how they fought against those injustices. For example, apartheid not only enforced racial segregation but also had gendered dimensions. Women experienced double discrimination because of their race and their gender.

I should try to find some resources that discuss the role of women in the anti-apartheid movement. Maybe there are books, articles, or online sources that can provide more detailed information.

Let me consider doing a web search to gather more information. I can look for keywords like "women in anti-apartheid movement," "role of women in apartheid struggle," or "famous women in South African anti-apartheid struggle."

I should be careful to use reliable sources, such as articles from reputable newspapers, academic journals, or websites maintained by historians or educational institutions.

Once I have gathered some information, I can try to synthesize it and present a coherent answer to the question.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the different ways in which women contributed to the struggle. For example, some might have been active in political organizations, while others may have provided support through community initiatives or provided care and assistance to political prisoners and their families.

I should also consider the challenges that women faced in the movement. Were there instances of gender inequality within the anti-apartheid organizations themselves? Did women have to fight for recognition and equal participation within these groups?

It would be interesting to explore how the struggle against apartheid intersected with feminist movements or gender equality campaigns.

Wait, maybe apartheid affected women differently than men, and their experiences and struggles were unique. I should try to understand those differences.

Perhaps I should look into specific events or campaigns where women played a pivotal role. For instance, I've heard of the 1956 Women's March on Pretoria, where thousands of women protested against pass laws that restricted the movement of black South Africans. That seems like a significant moment in the struggle.

I should definitely look into that march and learn more about it. Who organized it? What was its impact? Were there other similar events led by women?

Also, I should consider the long-term impact of women's involvement in the anti-apartheid movement. Did their participation lead to greater gender equality in post-apartheid South Africa?

Or, perhaps, their contributions were overlooked or undervalued after apartheid ended. It's essential to consider the broader historical context and the lasting effects of their activism.

I need to make sure that my answer is well-rounded and acknowledges the diverse roles and experiences of women in the struggle against apartheid.

Maybe I should create an outline to organize my thoughts:

I. Introduction

This outline seems comprehensive. Now, I need to fill in each section with relevant information.

Starting with the introduction, I need to provide some background on apartheid and the overall anti-apartheid movement.

Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It privileged whites and oppressed blacks, Coloureds, and Indians through laws that governed residence, employment, education, and virtually every aspect of life.

The anti-apartheid movement was a broad coalition of political parties, trade unions, student organizations, and community groups that opposed apartheid and called for equal rights and democracy. Among these groups, the African National Congress (ANC) was the most prominent and played a leading role in the struggle.

Now, moving on to key women figures. Winnie Mandela is probably the most internationally recognized woman associated with the anti-apartheid movement. She was married to Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years for his activism against apartheid. Winnie Mandela herself was actively involved in the ANC and its underground structures. She faced banning orders, house arrest, detention without trial, and exile. Her resilience and defiance made her a symbol of resistance for many.

Albertina Sisulu was another prominent woman in the movement. She was married to Walter Sisulu, who was also a key ANC leader. Albertina Sisulu was an activist in her own right, participating in various campaigns, including the Defiance Campaign and the women's anti-pass campaigns. She was arrested multiple times and spent several periods in prison.

There were many other influential women in the anti-apartheid struggle. For example, Lilian Ngoyi was one of the leaders of the 1956 Women's March and served as president of the ANC Women's League. Helen Joseph was a white anti-apartheid activist who worked closely with black activists and helped establish the Black Sash, an organization that advocated for human rights.

In terms of women's organizations, the ANC Women's League was founded in 1943 and played a vital role in mobilizing women for the struggle. They organized protests, provided support to political prisoners and their families, and pushed for women's rights within the ANC and broader society.

Other women's organizations included the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW), which was formed in 1954 and brought together women from different racial and class backgrounds to fight for democratic rights and an end to apartheid.

These women's organizations were instrumental in organizing mass action, such as the 1956 Women's March, where thousands of women of all races converged on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest against the extension of pass laws to women. This was a significant moment in the struggle and demonstrated the power of women's mobilization.

Women also played various roles in the anti-apartheid movement beyond organizational leadership. Many were involved in grassroots activism, providing support to communities affected by apartheid policies, setting up schools and clinics, and offering care and assistance to those impacted by political violence and imprisonment.

Moreover, women faced specific challenges under apartheid, such as restrictions on movement, employment discrimination, and gender-based violence. Their activism often addressed these gendered dimensions of apartheid, fighting not only for racial equality but also for women's rights.

However, despite their crucial contributions, women sometimes faced sexism and gender inequality within the anti-apartheid organizations themselves. There were instances where women's roles were marginalized, and their leadership was not fully recognized. This led to internal struggles within the movement for greater gender equality.

Looking at the legacy of women's involvement in the anti-apartheid struggle, their efforts paved the way for greater recognition of women's rights in post-apartheid South Africa. The new constitution adopted in 1996 includes strong provisions for gender equality, and there have been efforts to promote women's participation in politics and other spheres of society.

Nevertheless, gender inequalities persist in South Africa, and some argue that the promises of the anti-apartheid struggle have not been fully realized for women. Therefore, the struggle for gender equality continues.

In conclusion, women played a vital and multifaceted role in the struggle against apartheid, from leadership positions to grassroots activism, and their contributions were essential to the eventual dismantling of the apartheid system.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Women played a crucial and multifaceted role in the struggle against apartheid, including leadership, grassroots activism, and advocacy for both racial and gender equality.}} \]
