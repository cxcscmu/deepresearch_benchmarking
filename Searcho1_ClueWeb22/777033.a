So I've got this question: "Why didn't people smile in old photographs?" It sounds like a simple enough question, but I'm not entirely sure about the answer. I think it has something to do with the technology of cameras back then, maybe the exposure time was long, so people had to stay still for a while. But I'm not positive. Maybe I should look it up.

First, I need to understand the context. When we talk about "old photographs," we're probably talking about photos from the dawn of photography up to, say, the early 20th century. Photography has come a long way since then, so there must have been some technical limitations that affected how people posed for pictures.

Let me think about the history of photography. The earliest practical photographic methods were developed in the early to mid-19th century, right? Like the daguerreotype process in the 1830s and 1840s. I remember that these early processes required longer exposure times compared to what we have now. So, maybe that's a key factor here.

If exposure times were long, smiling and holding that expression for a minute or more would be difficult. Smiling naturally causes movement in facial muscles, which might result in blurred images. So, perhaps people opted for more neutral expressions to ensure their photos turned out clear.

But, was that the only reason? I recall hearing other explanations as well. Maybe social conventions played a role. In Victorian times, for example, there were certain standards of dignity and formality that people felt they had to uphold in portraits. Smiling might have been seen as inappropriate or even impolite for formal photographs.

Also, dental hygiene wasn't as advanced back then. Many people had bad teeth or missing teeth, so they might have been self-conscious about smiling widely for photos.

I should verify these thoughts. Maybe I should look up some information online to confirm whether these are valid reasons or not.

Let me try formulating a search query for this.

Why people never smiled in old photographs - Vox
Why people never smiled in old photographs
By Phil Edwards @PhilEdwardsInc phil.edwards@vox.com Updated Oct  7, 2016,  9:50am EDT
Why people never smiled in old photos
In most old photos — those taken in the 19th century and early 20th century — people aren't smiling. That's led to the popular belief that people simply didn't smile in old photos. Like in this depressing wedding photo from 1900:

So why did people in old photos look like they'd just heard the worst news of their life? We can't know for sure, but a few theories help us guess what was behind all that black-and-white frowning.
1) Very early technology made it harder to capture smiles
One common explanation for the lack of smiles in old photos is that long exposure times — the time a camera needs to take a picture — made it important for the subject of a picture to stay as still as possible. That way, the picture wouldn't look blurry.

The picture above illustrates why early cameras made it harder to capture a smile. One figure in the center is blurry, most likely because he moved slightly during the long exposure time. In theory, you'd want to maintain as still a position as possible, and it's harder to maintain a smile than a relatively flat facial expression.
But that's only part of the story — and was really only a huge factor in the very early days of photography. As George Eastman House curator Todd Gustavson told me when I was researching the history of the selfie, exposure times had gotten a lot shorter by 1900 with the introduction of the Brownie and other cameras. These cameras were still slow by today's standards, but not so slow that it was impossible to smile.
Yet smiles were still uncommon in the early part of the century. That suggests there were also cultural reasons people didn't smile in old pictures. Any general cultural theories involve a few leaps of faith — but these try to explain why old photos look so sad.
2) Early photography was heavily influenced by painting — which meant no smiling

Today, photography is a means of recording our lives as they're lived. But in the early days of the art, it was indebted to a tradition of portraiture in painting. A photograph was a frozen presentation of a person, not a moment in time. Even the models thought so.
In 1894, the Photographic Journal of America interviewed a model named Elmer Ellsworth Masterman. He had an unusual gig — he professionally modeled as Jesus Christ for paintings and photographs. He also didn't see the distinction between the two art forms. "What is the difference between posing for a photograph and posing for a painting?" he asked.
The photographic tradition of portraiture began in part because of the technological limitations of cameras that had to take pictures slowly. But even once cameras improved, it was difficult to imagine photography as a unique art with its own aesthetics. Even when it was easier to take pictures quickly, cameras still represented an ideal of life, not a slice of it. That meant no smiling.
3) Early photographs were seen as a passage to immortality

When we snap a profile picture today, part of the goal is to look cool or to document fleeting moments. But people didn't think about their Facebook page in the early days of photography. For them, photographs were a passage to immortality.
That's especially evident in the tradition of postmortem photography. In that genre, a recently deceased person, child, or pet would be photographed as if they were still alive. Begun in the early days of photography, it had largely — though not completely — petered out by 1900. But it reveals the mentality of the time: portraiture was used as a way to preserve the living for future generations.
That meant the medium was predisposed to seriousness over the ephemeral. There's no better reflection of that idea than the words of Mark Twain — a man who made a living as a humorist and wrote stories about jumping frogs. Even he said, "I think a photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever."
4) Victorian and Edwardian culture looked down on smiling

The fourth argument for why people in old photos frowned is one of the most compelling — though also the hardest to prove. It's possible that many people in the early 1900s simply thought smiling was for idiots.
Nicholas Jeeves surveyed smiling in portraits for the Public Domain Review and came to the conclusion that there was a centuries-long history of viewing smiling as something only buffoons did. (Jeeves dismisses the alternative theory that bad teeth kept people from smiling — after all, if everybody had bad teeth, it probably wasn't a problem.)
Like any sweeping cultural thesis, it's a tough statement to prove, and the exceptions are abundant. For example, the Flickr group "Smiling Victorians" has 2,100 photos, and at least some of them show genuine grins. That alone is a significant counterargument. But the prevailing concept of old pictures as humorless relics seems on the mark (and is confirmed, in some ways, by the need to make a special Flickr group for pictures that aren't dour).
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the culture at large may have frowned on the smile, and it took a while to learn to love it.
But then why was this man smiling?
All that is what makes the photograph below, taken around 1904, so striking. It's from a collection of Berthold Laufer's images from his expedition to China (and featured by the American Museum of Natural History Library ).
This man is definitely smiling:
A picture from 1904 — yes, 1904 — of a man smiling while eating rice. (Laufer/American Museum of Natural History Library, Image #336609)
We don't know much about the photo itself. But it offers a perfect opportunity to examine why it seems like people in old photos never smiled.
The clues might lie in photographer and subject. Photographer Berthold Laufer was an anthropologist, which meant he had a different mission than other photographers of his time — he sought to record life instead of pose it. That goal meant capturing a wider range of emotions. His rice-loving subject may have been willing to grin because he was from a different culture with its own sensibility concerning photography and public behavior. Both of them were outsiders to the mainstream photographic culture.
Together, they create a picture that's memorable even now. We don't know for sure why one man eating rice looked so happy — but we do know it led to a picture that can still make us smile today.

Why Didn’t People Smile in Old Photos?
Sep 23, 2013
Michael Zhang
Ever wonder why people in old paintings and photographs generally don’t have smiles on their faces? We explored this subject a little back in November 2012, and found that reasons may have included technical limitations, oral hygiene, and the seriousness of formal occasions.
Over at the Public Domain Review, Nicholas Jeeves has written up an in-depth piece on this subject that comes to some different conclusions.
Do a search for vintage portraits online, and you’ll see that generally people looked serious (and sometimes pissed).
First off, Jeeves dismisses the notion that people of old refused to smile because their teeth were rotting. It wasn’t that people didn’t have bad teeth, as dental hygiene really was awful, but rather that bad teeth were so common that seeing them did not take away from a person’s attractiveness at the time.
So what were some of the real reasons people didn’t smile? Jeeves writes that in addition to the simple fact that nice-looking smiles are difficult to create and capture, one of the main reasons was how smiles were perceived centuries ago.
Although nowadays we think of smiles as being indicative of happiness, humor, and warmth, they apparently had a very different meaning back in the day:
By the 17th century in Europe it was a well-established fact that the only people who smiled broadly, in life and in art, were the poor, the lewd, the drunk, the innocent, and the entertainment
Want to be seen as upper class and as a person of good character? Don’t smile.
For this reason, both the creators and the sitters of portraits had good reason to keep the smiles out of the resulting images, which explains why we don’t see photos of famous figures donning a grin in their official portraits.
Abraham Lincoln, although known for his humorous personality during his time, is now remembered more by the extremely serious expressions he chose to wear during official portrait sessions:
Another man Jeeves cites is author and humorist Mark Twain. He was quite a funny guy as well, but Twain hardly let any of that show in his portrait photographs:
In a letter to the Sacramento Daily Union, Twain wrote, “A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever.”

The Real Reason No One Smiled In Old Photographs - KnowledgeNuts
The Real Reason No One Smiled In Old Photographs
by M.Admin
“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high… that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contradictory to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, since nature gave us lips to conceal them.” — St. Jean-Baptiste De La Salle, The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, 1703
In A Nutshell
Over the years, many theories have popped up trying to explain why smiles are so rare in old photographs. The most popular ideas were that people didn’t want to show their bad teeth or, alternatively, that it was impractical to hold a smile during the long exposure times of early cameras. While these issues might have prevented some from grinning, the major reason for the serious looks was because most people thought smiling made them look ridiculous.
The Whole Bushel
At one point in time, it was largely believed that people didn’t smile in old photographs because they were hiding rotten or missing teeth, which were all too common prior to the days of modern dentistry. It turns out this wasn’t really true, since there were plenty of individuals who had fabulous chompers, yet still kept their mouths shut during pictures. Not to mention, humans can smile without revealing their teeth. Furthermore, bad teeth were so ordinary that they weren’t necessarily seen as unattractive. In fact, Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister of 1855, was considered devastatingly good-looking even though he was lacking several obvious teeth.
With the teeth theory busted, the next idea to become widely accepted was that no one smiled because cameras had incredibly long exposure times—anywhere from five minutes to more than 30. It would have been uncomfortable and perhaps impossible to force a grin and stay still for that amount of time. While that idea does make sense, it doesn’t explain why subjects were rarely depicted smiling in old paintings or why people didn’t start showing their pearly whites in the 1840s when exposure times for photos were under a minute.
Article Continued Below
Ultimately, the real reason folks didn’t smile was because they thought it made them look stupid. Most individuals simply didn’t want to be immortalized for all of history with a goofy grin on their faces. Mark Twain summed it up best when he said, “A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever.”
According to Nicholas Jeeves, who wrote an extensive article on the topic, by the 17th century “it was a well-established fact that the only people who smiled broadly, in life and in art, were the poor, the lewd, the drunk, the innocent, and the entertainment.”
Nowadays we smile in photos to show happiness or warmth, but back then it was viewed as the equivalent of duckface—a look no self-respecting Victorian would want recorded. As photography advanced and became more common, folks didn’t have to choose a single expression to serve as their memorial for the ages, which opened them up to showing a range of expressions in photos. Still, we can only imagine what they’d think of the hundreds of thousands of pics that are now taken every minute, complete with our foolish smirks, photobombs, and compromising selfies.

Now You Know: Why Do People Always Look So Serious in Old Photos?
By Merrill Fabry

The first photographs were taken in the late 1820s, and the new medium developed throughout the rest of the century as a practical tool, artistic form and social activity. But, even though there were a few smiles to be found in the early years of photography, it took until the 1920s and ’30s for smiles to start becoming the standard expression in photographs.
So why was that the case, and what changed?
One possibility is dental. Some dismiss the idea that bad teeth could have been a possible cause for early photography’s close-lipped images, since that was a common condition and wouldn’t have necessarily been noteworthy at the time. But Angus Trumble, the director of the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, Australia, and author of A Brief History of the Smile, disagrees. He points to the professionalization of dental health as one factor leading to the rise of smiles, arguing that just because bad teeth were normal didn’t mean they were desirable. “People had lousy teeth, if they had teeth at all, which militated against opening your mouth in social settings,” he says.
Another common explanation for the lack of smiles in 19th century photographs is that, because it took so long to capture a photograph back then, people in pictures couldn’t hold a smile for long enough. “Some of that is true,” says Todd Gustavson, technology curator at the George Eastman Museum. “If you look at the early processes where you did have a long exposure time, you’re going to pick a pose that’s comfortable.” But he says that technology has been overplayed as the limiting factor. By the 1850s and ’60s it was possible in the right conditions to take photographs with only a few seconds of exposure time, and in the decades that followed shorter exposures became even more widely available. That means the technology needed to capture fleeting expressions like a genuine smile was available long before such a look became common.
Christina Kotchemidova, a professor studying culture and communication who wrote an article on the history of smiles in snapshot photography, also questions the technology argument. That idea, she says, comes from our world, in which it seems “natural to smile for a picture” and people have to be told not to. But, she says, while smiling in general may be innate, smiling in front of a camera is not an instinctive response.
Experts say that the deeper reason for the lack of smiles early on is that photography took guidance from pre-existing customs in painting—an art form in which many found grins uncouth and inappropriate for portraiture. Though saints might be depicted with faint smiles, wider smiles were “associated with madness, lewdness, loudness, drunkenness, all sorts of states of being that were not particularly decorous,” says Trumble. Accordingly, high-end studio photographers would create an elegant setting and direct the subject how to behave, producing the staid expressions which are so familiar in 19th century photographs. The images they created were formal and befitted the expense of paying to have a portrait made, especially when that portrait might be the only image of someone.
But even from the beginning, a less experienced photographer might break the norms that were being established, suggests Gustavson. Some early photographs of smiles show the importance of context in determining the expression on the subject’s face. A photograph of two officers in the Mexican-American war in 1847 shows one smiling, and an image of poker players from 1853 also has one smiling man and one focused on his cards. An African-American man with his hands up as though boxing was preserved with a smile in 1860. These are still performative portraits, but they’re not quite like the formal painted portraits of the upper classes. As the types of people who took photographs and sat for portraits expanded, that in turn widened the range of acceptable expressions for portraits.

So it makes sense that what perhaps changed those formal expressions most was the rise of snapshot photography, which further democratized the medium.
“Take the camera out of the professional and put it into the hands of the snapshot photographer and then they can do whatever they want” says Gustavson. With George Eastman’s 1888 Kodak camera, the chemical processing of the film was done for you and the camera came with an instruction manual. By including a section on what made a good picture, Eastman was “guiding cultural norms as to what photography was going to be,” Gustavson adds. The 1900 Brownie camera took it even further. At an affordable $1 each, it was marketed as a child’s camera, though plenty of adults used them too.
The norms of spontaneous, amateur photography began to bleed into more formal photography, says Trumble, as people developed new expectations about how they wanted to be seen. As the century wore on, photography and painting began to interact, each trying to take advantage of the other medium’s benefits. Painters would try to emulate the clarity and spontaneity of photos, and photographers would attempt to evoke the artistry of fine painting. That went for smiles too, Trumble says, as “people begin to smile in effervescent ways” in painted portraits during in the Edwardian period, about 1895-1914, after the same change took place in photography.
By World War II, the shift in photographic norms was pretty much complete.
A study of high school yearbook photos in the U.S. taken from 1905 to 2005 told a similar story of the changing default expression. The researchers averaged images of men and women by decade, and though it was a specific sample, they found that average lip curvature increased over time and also that women led the way to toothy grins, on average smiling more than men did in any given decade.
Kotchemidova argues that it was no coincidence that the broad grin was an American phenomenon, and that advertising played a key role in its spread. The Kodak catchphrase “you press the button, we do the rest” was part of a shift from threatening ads to a more positive strategy and “Kodak was one of the pioneers,” she says. The new method focused on consumer happiness with the product and portrayed consumers using the camera during happy moments. These commercial cues that smiling was what you should do in a photograph were particularly effective at influencing people, bypassing the need to explain why someone should be beaming at the camera. People internalized the messages, Kotchemidova believes, and imitated the examples in front of them.
That is perhaps the most important lesson of the study of historical smiles: whether or not people are smiling in photographs has very little to do with how happy they are.
People in the 1800s weren’t unhappy all the time. Both Queen Victoria and Abraham Lincoln, for example, were noted for their humor; though they certainly had things to worry about, photographs of Lincoln sometimes have a hint of upturned corners of the mouth and there’s even a photograph of the Queen smiling outright.
“People in human history have smiled, laughed, and behaved more or less as they do today, in other words naturally and spontaneously, in the private sphere,” says Trumble. “What is radically different is public performance and public presentation.”

Why Didn’t People Smile in Old Photos?
Why Didn’t People Smile in Old Photos?
By Jessica Grimaud
October 9, 2019
Ever looked at an old, black-and-white photograph and wondered, “Why the long face?” You might have heard that it was because of the cameras' long exposure times, or maybe you were told that poor dental work meant that fewer people wanted to show their teeth in old photos.
While these explanations may play a part, the main reason why people didn’t smile in old photos had more to do with culture and customs of old paintings and portraiture than it did with poor technology.
Smile in Old Photos
The Tradition of Not Smiling for Painted Portraits
Before photography, the main mode of preserving a family’s or person’s image was through painting portraits. It was customary for families and individuals in these commissioned, traditional portraits to have stoic, regal expressions. If they did smile, it would be only slightly.
This early custom was because wide-mouthed, toothy grins were considered inappropriate for portraiture. Even in other kinds of old paintings, a person's wide smiles were often associated with madness, drunkenness, or otherwise informal, immature behavior.
When photography was introduced as a new way of preserving a person or family’s likeness, people continued the tradition of unsmiling expressions because it was familiar to them, and the ideals for capturing someone’s likeness had not changed.
When Did We Start Smiling in Photographs?
So what changed? How did we go from stoic expressions to saying “Cheese!” for grins? It goes back to the 1900 Brownie camera, one of the first early cameras that were accessible and affordable to the public. As photograph technology became more accessible to everyday people, photos were more spontaneous and captured candid smiles and laughter.
People began to prefer the amateur photos that captured their smiling, joyful expressions. The practice of photographing smiles crept into formal photography, and eventually it was culturally acceptable—and then encouraged—to smile in family photos and portraits.

Alright, so I've got these articles that try to explain why people didn't smile in old photographs. Let's see what they say.

First, there's the idea that people were hiding their bad teeth. But according to some sources, like the Public Domain Review article, bad teeth were so common that they weren't seen as unattractive. Plus, there are examples of people with good teeth who still didn't smile in photos. So, maybe that's not the main reason.

Next, there's the exposure time theory. Back in the early days of photography, cameras required longer exposure times, so people had to stay still for a while to get a clear picture. Smiling and holding that expression for a minute or more could be difficult, leading to blurred images. But, as mentioned in the Vox article, by 1900, exposure times had shortened, yet people still weren't smiling much in photos. So, while long exposure times might have contributed to the seriousness in early photos, it's not the whole story.

Then, there's the cultural aspect. Apparently, in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, smiling was seen as inappropriate for formal portraits. It was considered impolite or even foolish to grin in a serious portrait. This is supported by quotes from figures like Mark Twain, who thought that a silly smile wasn't suitable for a lasting portrait.

Another point is that photography was influenced by painting traditions. In paintings, serious expressions were the norm for portraits, and photography followed suit. It was about presenting a dignified and formal image rather than capturing a spontaneous moment.

Also, the idea of photography as a way to achieve immortality played a role. People wanted to look their best, which often meant adopting a serious expression rather than smiling.

But, interestingly, not everyone followed these norms. There are examples of people smiling in old photographs, especially in more casual or ethnographic settings. So, it wasn't an absolute rule, but rather a general trend.

It seems that over time, as photography became more widespread and accessible, people started to feel more comfortable expressing themselves in photos, leading to more smiles. The invention of cameras like the Brownie made photography more democratic, and snapshots captured more natural, spontaneous expressions, including smiles.

In summary, while technical limitations may have initially contributed to the lack of smiles in early photographs, the primary reason appears to be cultural norms and attitudes towards portraiture and public presentation. As society evolved and photography became more commonplace, so did smiling in photos.
