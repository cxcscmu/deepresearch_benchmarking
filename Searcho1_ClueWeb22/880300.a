I've been asked whether women experience pain differently than men. Hmm, that's an interesting question. I've heard people say that women have higher pain tolerances because of childbirth, but I'm not sure if that's accurate or fair. Maybe there's more to it than that. I should probably look into some scientific studies or research on this topic to get a better understanding.

First, I need to clarify what is meant by "experience pain differently." Does this refer to how pain is perceived, how it's expressed, or how it's tolerated? Maybe all of the above. It's possible that biological differences between men and women affect how pain is processed, or perhaps there are societal and cultural factors that influence how pain is experienced and expressed.

I think it's important to consider both biological and psychological aspects here. Biologically, men and women have different hormonal makeups, which could influence pain perception. For example, estrogen and progesterone levels in women might affect how they experience pain at different times during their menstrual cycle. Also, women may be more attuned to expressing pain due to social conditioning, whereas men might be encouraged to tough it out.

But I don't want to rely on stereotypes. I need factual information to answer this question properly. Maybe I should look up some articles or studies on gender differences in pain experience.

Let me try searching for "gender differences in pain perception" to see what comes up.

Do men and women perceive and react to pain differently? Do men and women use different coping strategies when they experience recurrent or chronic pain? These questions are relevant to pain management providers when they assess and develop treatment plans for patients who experience pain on a daily basis.
Men and women experience pain differently.
Although once ignored in medical research, the idea that men and women experience pain differently is now accepted.¹ In 1995, a major review of the research on gender and pain found that women experience more pain compared to men.²
The authors suggested that women have a lower pain threshold and tolerance to experimental pain including mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli. In other words, women experience painful stimuli as more intense than men.
However, the authors pointed out that there are a number of issues that contribute to the variability between the genders, including whether pain threshold or tolerance were being measured. In 2000, Dao and LeResche listed a number of factors that contribute to this variability, including dimensions of pain measured, type of stimulus, characteristics of the experimental environment, spatial and temporal aspects of the stimulus, and characteristics of the subject.³
I believe an additional factor must be controlled, and that is the sex of the observer. It is well understood that both men and women subjects react differently based on the gender of the experimenter.
Mechanisms Driving Differences
A well-designed study by Roger Fillingim et al showed that sex differences in pain response are well documented, but the mechanisms underlying these differences are not well understood.⁴ Fillingim proposed that gender roles and pain responses could be mediated by a subject’s perceived ability to tolerate pain. In other words, stereotypical sex roles are perceived to influence greater tolerance for pain among men than women. The results of this study showed that men had higher pain tolerance, but this triggered a higher blood pressure (BP) response. Fillingim et al pointed out that a body of evidence suggests that higher resting BP is associated with lower pain sensitivity.⁴ (see Interview with Roger B. Fillingim, PhD.)
One interesting explanation forwarded by the authors was that men tried harder to tolerate the pain, resulting in higher systolic BP. Also, keep in mind that systolic BP is related to sympathetic arousal. The authors concluded that perceived ability to tolerate pain may have influenced the relationship between cardiovascular variables and pain tolerance.²
Even though men appear to tolerate painful stimulus better, some data suggest that sustained low-level pain may be more disturbing to men than women. In a study by Frot et al, 10 men and 10 women received 2 applications of topical capsaicin for 30 minutes—first on the face and then the ankle. The subjects rated pain intensity, unpleasantness, and anxiety each minute during capsaicin application and for 30 minutes after its removal.
The investigators found that men showed a significant positive correlation between anxiety (sympathetic arousal) and pain intensity, whereas women did not.⁵ The results of the study support the general conclusion that although men perceive experimental pain less intensely than women do, they have more anxiety related to pain.
Evidence of the magnitude of gender differences in pain was revealed by a meta-analysis of research using experimentally induced pain.⁶ In this meta-analysis, Riley et al pointed out a number of assumptions relevant to gender differences, such as cultural and physiological influences, including the fact that males have been socialized to suppress outward signs of pain. They also mentioned the important influence of the menstrual cycle on pain perception. Females demonstrated more pain sensitivity following a mid-cycle surge during the luteal phase.⁷
An interesting study by Sarlani et al examined the concept of temporal summation as it relates to gender and pain.⁸ Temporal summation of pain is the increase in pain intensity after repetitive noxious stimulation of constant intensity. Temporal summation is regarded as a psycho-physiological correlate of wind-up. Wind-up is the increase in the magnitude of second-order nociceptive neuron responses to the application of repetitive noxious stimuli of constant strength. The authors believe that wind-up and temporal summation of pain share common features and have a central basis. Current thinking suggests that temporal summation is upregulated more frequently in women than in men.
Sarlani et al applied a series of repetitive, mildly noxious, mechanical stimuli to the fingers of 25 women and 25 men.⁸ The subjects rated the pain intensity and unpleasantness caused by the first, fifth, and tenth stimulus in the series, as well as after-sensations 15 seconds and 1 minute after the end of stimulation.
The investigators found that temporal summation of pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings were more pronounced in women than men (P <0.0001).⁸Moreover, women reported higher ratings for the intensity and the unpleasantness of after-sensations (P <0.0005) and more frequent painful after-sensations (P <0.05).
“Greater temporal summation of pain and after sensations in women suggests that their central processing of nociceptive input may be more easily upregulated into pathological hyperexcitability, possibly accounting for the higher prevalence of various chronic pain conditions among women,” noted the authors.⁸
Most recently, Sorge et al discovered that female mice do not require microglia activation to produce mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Rather, the researchers wrote that “female mice achieved similar levels of pain hypersensitivity using adaptive immune cells, likely T lymphocytes. This sexual dimorphism suggests that male mice cannot be used as proxies for females in pain research.”⁹
Pain Medicine and Gender
The fact that men and women respond differently to pain medicine is an important issue in the practice of pain management. The most frequently prescribed pain medicines belong in the opioid class. Opioids work through specific opioid receptors that are well documented. Three types of opioid receptors have been identified: mu, delta, and kappa, with mu and kappa being the most frequently occurring receptors in humans.¹
Research by Craft found that women use 40% less opioid-based medicine than men for postoperative pain.¹⁰ This finding was confirmed by Miaskowski et al in an analysis of 18 studies of postoperative opioid use. The researchers found an increase in opioid consumption among male patients in 10 studies (56%), but the remaining 8 studies (44%) showed no gender difference.¹¹
Several studies of pain after oral surgery revealed that women get much greater pain relief from mixed-action opioid medications (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol).¹² More recently, a meta-analysis of this literature confirmed that women seem to experience greater pain relief with opioids; however, they also report more side effects.¹³
Several factors can explain the differential response to pain medicine between men and women. Sex hormones (estrogen) can modulate the density of opioid receptors.¹⁴ In addition, research on sex hormones indicates there is improved mu receptor binding in some brain regions in women after they receive estrogen, as measured by PET scans.¹⁵ Recent advances in genetics also have revealed greater opioid analgesia in women with specific receptor genes that mediate female responses.¹¹
Finally, it is important to remember that psychological factors influence the response to opioid-based therapy. Anxiety and sympathetic reactivity [as seen more in male patients] imposes a major negative influence in pain perception and brain activity and may influence opioid analgesia among the sexes.¹⁶
Biological Factors Influence Perception of Pain
In 2000, Fillingim published a biopsychosocial model that has influenced the thinking about the differences between genders that is evident today.¹⁷ The factors he proposed as being responsible for the differences are:
Biological factors, including sex hormones and endogenous pain control mechanisms
Psychological factors, including anxiety and negative affect
Sociocultural factors, including gender role expectations of pain
The model also shows that the perception of pain is influenced by the interaction of all these factors working together.²˒¹⁷
Sex hormones, according to this model, are relevant to the evaluation and treatment of pain.¹⁸ When considering all of the biological factors, the role of sex hormones has received the most research attention. According to Marchand, sex hormones in the central nervous system (CNS) have been documented to influence the neurotransmitters that are involved in the perception of pain.¹
The main sex hormones in women are estrogen and progesterone, which will vary according to the menstrual cycle. Testosterone also is present in women but at a level that is 10 to 15 times lower than the level present in men. In addition, girls and boys react to pain in a similar fashion before puberty but differently after puberty; these differences, however, decrease as levels of sex hormones decrease as people age.¹⁹
In a recent well-designed study, investigators demonstrated that changes in plasma levels of estrogen influenced changes in serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, and endorphine.²⁰ Additional research has examined the role of progesterone and found similar influences on levels of dopamine and acetycholine.²¹
Estrogen receptors have been found in the dorsal horn, which suggests there may be mechanisms that could regulate pain sensitivity by influencing neurotransmitters such as substance P, gamma-amino butyric acid, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.²² One of the conclusions forwarded from this research is that a decrease in estrogen would increase sensitivity to pain. Conversely, an increase in estrogen would promote analgesic effect by stimulating a bolus of pain-inhibiting transmitters.²²
It appears that testosterone plays a protective role in decreasing the perception of pain.²³ An example of this protective role was suggested recently in a study investigating the protective effect testosterone plays in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which affects 3 times as many women as men.²⁴ Further evidence was demonstrated when men who experience RA reported fewer affected joints after taking testosterone.²⁵
Psychosocial Influences
Fillingim’s model described the importance of psychosocial factors that contribute gender differences in pain responses. One question that is frequently raised is the weight given to each factor in Fillingim’s model—biological and psychosocial.¹⁷In my opinion, Fillingim’s biopsychosocial model would answer that it is a reciprocal interaction between the 2 factors. To determine the amount of weight given to each factor is a difficult task because it is a dynamic model that will change depending on the internal and external forces in play at any given moment.
Anxiety at a clinical level includes both cognitive and physiological contributions that have a cumulative impact on the perception of pain and how a person copes with that perception. As an emotional state, anxiety can be described as hyper-vigilant tension that is usually associated with the unpleasant feeling of fear.²⁶
The psycho-physiological component of anxiety is reflected in an elevated sympathetic nervous system reaction. It is well accepted that elevated levels of anxiety increase the perception of pain.²⁷ This finding is independent of the intensity of the painful stimulus.
Recent research has examined the influence of anxiety in relation to gender differences and the reaction to pain. Both clinical and experimental studies have found that anxiety was associated with increased pain sensitivity in men but not women.⁶˒¹⁶˒²⁸˒²⁹
It is important to point out that, historically, the concept of anxiety was divided into 2 categories: State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety. State Anxiety implies a time-limited state, or “an anxious state,” as compared to Trait Anxiety, which is a longer-lasting feature of the personality. One study suggested that men feel more State Anxiety associated with pain or that the reaction (anxiety) in men is more time limited than it is in women.²⁹ Another study on the topic suggested that women may have a lower level of State Anxiety related to pain but a higher level of Trait Anxiety independent of pain.¹⁶
The anxiety differences between men and women have been examined in experimental pain research. In men, acute stress and State Anxiety are associated with increased opioid inhibitory response and higher levels of cortisol.³⁰ This finding may help explain gender differences by suggesting that men, when they experience elevated levels of State Anxiety, also activate descending inhibitory mechanisms. The differences between men and women may be explained by dividing anxiety into the 2 separate factors. Pain perception is related to State Anxiety in men and Trait Anxiety in women.¹⁶
Depression
The role of depression and gender also has been examined extensively in recent years. The overall evidence suggests that depression is a significant predictor of the development of chronic pain.³¹ In addition, research supports the finding that as the number of depressive symptoms increase, pain will increase.³² The prevalence of depression in patients who experience chronic pain suggests a wide range, from a low of 30% to a high of 54%, in the total pain population.³³ The question that must be answered is, does depression influence the role of pain between the genders?
Research suggests that an association exists between depressive symptoms and increased somatic focus only for women.³⁴ Somatic focus influences the reporting of pain, and the consensus of research suggests that depression is positively correlated with pain in women and not men.³⁵˒³⁶ As mentioned earlier, Marchand pointed out that depression is related to reduced opioid analgesia. He proposed that this link could explain, in part, why women perceive more pain than men.¹
It is well understood that negative emotions, such as anger, magnify the pain experience.³⁷ We also now know that pain does not generate the same emotional response across both genders. Research suggests that women become more frustrated and men become more anxious when coping with persistent pain.³⁸ In addition, anger has been associated with greater sensitivity to acute pain and to persistent pain.⁴ Conversely, it is interesting to note that positive emotions inhibit the pain response and facilitate coping.²⁹
I remember reading Norman Cousins’ Anatomy of an Illness, which was published in 1979.³⁹ When Cousins wrote the book, he was experiencing a serious collagen illness, a disease of the connective tissue. He talked about the work of Walter B. Cannon who introduced the concept of homeostatic responses, or natural processes that enable the individual to return to the “normal” state before it experienced the noxious influence.
He also referenced the work of William Osler, who felt that successful healing was due to the individual’s personality and behavior, independent of medicine. So, in cooperation with his doctors, Cousins developed a program to enhance positive affirmative emotions, with the goal of enhancing body chemistry. To achieve this goal, he used funny movies, such as Marx Brothers’ films, to generate genuine belly laughter. The program worked—his sedimentation rates improved, inflammation was reduced, and he experienced more pain-free sleep. I still recommend this book to patients, and the feedback usually is positive.³⁹
Cognition and Pain
How we think about pain and the language we use to describe our pain are very important cognitive factors that influence how we react to and cope with persistent pain. Research suggests that women use more emotional and social strategies to cope with pain, whereas men use more active approaches to deal with pain.⁴⁰
In my opinion, the explanation for this difference is based in how boys and girls are socialized. This opinion is based on a well-designed study by Mechanic conducted in the 1960s, during which he found that boys express pain less than girls.⁴¹ It has been suggested that masculine behavior is more narrowly defined and rigid compared to feminine behavior.⁴¹
A related recent study suggested that young girls express more emotional distress than boys when they experience pain. This same study indicated that girls are more adept at using social and emotional support from those around them compared to boys.⁴²
The role of catastrophizing in recent years has become a major predictive factor in outcome studies involving pain treatment. Edwards et al designed a study examining catastrophizing as a mediator of gender differences in both recurrent daily pain and experimental pain.⁴³
The results of this study suggested that sex differences in recurrent daily pain are due to levels of catastrophizing. However, the results did not support the higher threshold and tolerance levels to thermal and cold pain observed in men. The authors stated that catastrophizing appears to emerge relatively early in development and is more common among adolescent girls.
A well-designed study by Keefe et al examined the role of gender differences in pain coping and mood in individuals with osteoarthritic knee pain. What was unique about this study is the format of multiple pain ratings twice a day (afternoon and evening) for 30 days.⁴⁴ Women exhibited an increase in pain over the course of the day, whereas men exhibited an increase in coping efficacy over the day. In addition, men experienced more negative mood in the morning after an evening of increased pain.
The uniqueness of this study pointed out the importance of obtaining multiple daily assessments when studying gender differences.⁴⁴
Gender and Neurological Differences
Research examining neural differences between the genders to a painful stimulus has gained more attention in recent years. Improvements in brain imaging have provided additional information that helps us understand how men and women respond to pain.
A Canadian research group, using healthy, normal subjects, found a positive relationship in activation differences between men and women. Their findings suggested that women, not men, demonstrate a strong positive, linear relationship between perigenual anterior cingulated cortex and the report of pain.⁴⁵
This finding is consistent with other research suggesting that women are more emotionally responsive and perceptive when presented with a negative emotional experience.⁴²Tremblay et al suggested that men deactivate prefrontal suppression when processing pain, which leads to the mobilization of threat control circuits when they experience pain.⁴⁵
What evolutionary purpose could explain gender differences in relation to the pain experience? Tremblay et al speculated that men have occupied the role of hunter and defender against aggressive behavior, so they have learned to cope with pain to survive; in contrast, women have developed a strong sense of trust and sensitivity, which promotes strong social bonds that help them cope with pain and support the survival of the group.⁴⁵
Conclusion
Pain medicine has evolved and matured since I started practicing some 30 years ago. During this time, the field has gained an understanding of the importance of gender in the pain experience. I hope all pain providers incorporate these findings to improve treatment plans to benefit all patients coping with persistent pain.

Abstract
Objective: This review highlights research on sex-based differences in pain perception and treatment. We sought to illuminate the complex factors contributing to differences in pain and analgesic responses between males and females, ranging from psychosocial to biological processes.
Design: We reviewed published studies of pain induction by chemical, electric, heat, surgical, or psychological means, and opioid and nonopioid analgesia comparing responses in men and women.
Results: A substantial body of research indicates that women experience greater clinical pain, suffer greater pain-related distress, and show heightened sensitivity to experimentally induced pain compared with men. Research on sex-based differences in the pain experience and treatment is beginning to uncover patterns that may enable tailoring of pain treatment to individual characteristics. The factors underpinning sex differences in the experience of pain are multifactorial and complex; for example, psychosocial factors such as pain-related catastrophizing may explain sex-based differences in reporting certain types of pain, as women tend to use catastrophizing to a greater degree. Gonadal hormone levels in cycling women also have a substantial impact on pain perception and analgesic response. Women perceive more pain during the luteal phase, and estrogen antagonists provide long-term pain relief in certain situations.
Conclusions: Collectively, greater understanding of the factors that commonly and differentially affect the disparity in pain perception, as well as analgesic response, are beginning to illuminate research targets and promising areas of therapeutic intervention for improved pain management.

Why Women and Men Experience Pain Differently
Women and men experience pain differently, but why and how? This article takes you through the science behind gender differences in pain.
Ann-Marie D'arcy-Sharpe February 19, 2020
A great deal of research shows that women and men perceive and experience pain differently, including acute and chronic pain. It’s been proven that women experience greater levels of pain than men in reaction to the same painful stimuli. Women also experience more distress and suffering in relation to pain. What you might be wondering is why this is the case! Let’s take a look at the factors involved.
Central pain processing and nerve density
There are thought to be different neural pathways in men and women, which mean that they physically pick up on outside stimuli differently. Essentially, gender differences in how their bodies perceive pain. This in depth study on the topic explains that, “ There may be sex differences in peripheral afferent pathways, in the central networks which integrate and process noxious sensation, and/or in the descending, efferent systems which modulate nociception.”
We all have sensory neurons called nociceptors throughout our bodies. These send signals to the brain when there is potential damage to the body, and research shows that these are typically more sensitive in females: “there is an extensive literature from both humans and animals demonstrating that females have lower pain thresholds across multiple sensory modalities.”
The central nervous system processes pain differently in women and men. This study discusses research which used scans to monitor patients, to find out which areas of the nervous system were active in men and women during experimental stimuli. All of the results show that women and men process both acute and chronic pain differently. The study explains, “ Research using fMRI has illuminated substantial sex differences in CNS (central nervous system) processing of pain stimuli and even of anticipation of pain stimuli “
Women also have an increased nerve density when compared to men. This article talks about a recent study, describing how they found that, “ women averaged 34 nerve fibers per square centimeter of facial skin while men only averaged 17 nerve fibers.” More nerves equals being more sensitive to outside stimuli. However, many scientists feel that the physiological reason for why women experience more pain than men, has more to with central pain processing differences rather than nerve density.
Perception and description of pain
There are also significant differences in how women and men pay attention to, and therefore describe their pain experience. Women tend to be more self aware of experiences and sensations within their body. This is thought to be because, from a young age, their menstrual cycle attunes them to their bodily processes. Women are often more regularly visiting a medical professional for things like smear tests, which can contribute to making them more likely to take notice of symptoms. Men are more inclined to forget past medical experiences than women, while women tend to recall past medical experiences in more detail.
This awareness means that women take more notice when something is wrong and pick up on smaller symptoms. This has both benefits and downfalls. This awareness means that women are more likely to seek help for ill health sooner, meaning they can get it under control more quickly. Meanwhile men are less likely to seek help until much later, making treatment more complex when they do reach out. However, this also means that women are more inclined to worry about their health, and therefore are more susceptible to negative thoughts about their pain. Women are therefore more likely to be hypervigilant (meaning being overly focused on their pain) and to catastrophize (meaning worry excessively) about their pain.
How we perceive chronic pain has a big impact on pain levels and quality of life. Negative perceptions of pain, being hypervigilant and catastrophizing about pain can reinforce pain signals, essentially telling your brain that it should continue producing pain. It can also contribute to the stress and pain cycle. Negative thoughts often lead to maladaptive (unhelpful) behaviours which are actually detrimental to chronic pain management.
Hormones
The hormones in a female body obviously differ from those within a male body. Hormones can have a significant effect on many factors, including how the body processes pain. The receptors for sex hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone and testosterone, are in the same areas of the nervous system as those which pick up and transmit pain messages. It therefore makes sense that hormones would have an influence on pain levels and how pain is processed.
Testosterone is anti-nociceptive, which means that it essentially blocks or lessens the effects of external painful stimuli. Levels of testosterone are much higher in men, which contributes to them experiencing less severe pain levels than women in response to the same stimuli.
The menstrual cycle has an impact on how women process pain. The hormones released at various stages of the menstrual cycle affect so many aspects, including mood and stress levels. As hormone levels change during the cycle, tissues, muscles and the skin respond differently to stimuli, becoming more or less sensitive. During the luteal phase (which is the stage of the menstrual cycle after ovulation before the period starts), pain sensitivity is heightened. During ovulation and just after the period, women also seem to be more sensitive to pain as this study discusses. Reproductive hormones can also increase inflammation within women. Inflammation is a big contributor to increasing pain levels and other associated symptoms of chronic pain.
Role beliefs and stigma
Women are more likely to report pain than men and to seek help. This could be attributed to gender stereotypes. Men are more likely to feel that they need to appear strong and ‘power through’ their pain, while women are more inclined to express their emotions and ask for assistance. This study explains that, “ Boys are taught to be less expressive about illness and discomfort, to be more stoical, and to use more denial”.
These masculine and feminine roles often result in females being more likely to seek help, both from medical professionals and from loved ones, while men feel they need to bottle things up. This can result in women having more effective coping strategies for their chronic pain symptoms.
Stigma both from society and from medical professionals can contribute to these role beliefs and affect how men and women seek treatment and deal with chronic pain. The way we cope with and manage our chronic pain has a big impact on quality of life and how severe our symptoms are. When we employ effective strategies, we can reduce our symptoms and live a full, functional life. This study states that, “males reporting more use of behavioral distraction while females rely more on social support and positive self-statements.”
In the doctor’s office men are less likely to be diagnosed with chronic pain, because many medical professionals view it as a ‘women’s illness’ and so may be reluctant to diagnose men as such. However men are taken more seriously in relation to health complaints in general than women, while women are often dismissed or thought of as ‘over exaggerating’. Men are more likely to be referred for tests to figure out what is causing their pain, while women are more likely to be repeatedly misdiagnosed. This study found that men are more likely to be given painkillers while women are more likely to be given sedatives or diagnosed with a mental health condition.
These differences in treatment are of course going to have an impact on each gender’s experience of pain. If men are less likely to seek treatment for their pain, they may struggle on silently for longer. However when they do seek treatment they are likely to be taken more seriously and given the treatment they need. Whereas while women asking for help early on should be a positive point, having their pain invalidated and not being given the treatment they need can actually contribute to stress and in turn worsen their experience of pain.
These roles of masculine and feminine are often ingrained into us as we grow up and what we learn from the world around us. Thankfully this is changing all the time and we are gradually creating a society that can break away from these gender roles, allowing people to be who they really are and express their true selves freely.
Mental health
Women are more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression, being 2 to 3 times more likely to struggle with these disorders as this study describes. This has a significant impact on our levels of chronic pain. Mental illness can also feed into maladaptive (negative) thought patterns and behaviours. When we are mentally ill, we are less likely to keep up with treatment and to practice self care. We’re more likely to withdraw from activity and isolate ourselves socially, which can also contribute to physical deconditioning.
Childhood trauma
Women are more likely to have experienced trauma in childhood. Trauma at a young age has been linked in many studies to chronic pain in adulthood. This study explains one assumed reason behind this, stating, “ This link may be driven by hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis abnormalities and/or neuroendocrine dysregulation caused by the initial trauma”
Emotional trauma in childhood and through the formative years, as well as physical abuse, can lead to mental illness. As we mentioned earlier, the symptoms of mental illness can perpetuate and worsen chronic pain, contributing to the pain and stress cycle as well as making maladaptive pain coping behaviours more likely.
Women are also, “ 8 to 25 times more likely” to experience trauma and abuse in an adult relationship than men, as this study mentions, which again can perpetuate the chronic pain cycle. The same study goes onto explain the severity of the impact this trauma in adulthood can have: “ interpersonal violence obviously results in more acute trauma and injury, as well as in more chronic symptoms such as headaches, chronic pain, menstrual symptoms, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, and more somatization.”
Reaction to pain medications
Pain medications, most notably opioids, are processed differently within men and women. Women are more likely to get more effective pain relief from opioids than men. There are opioid receptors within the brain which process the medication and use it to modulate pain. There are 3 of these receptors for opioids, with one being the most researched and thought to be the most significant. Many studies have shown that this most important receptor is more active in women as this study conveys, “ Human experiments consistently show that µ opioids have increased potency in females ”
This means that women are likely to be able to take lower doses of opioids, which therefore results in fewer side effects. Meanwhile men may need to take a higher dose to get the same effect, and could end up struggling with multiple side effects.
What does this really mean?
These differences do not mean that women are weaker, or that men are stronger. Nor does it mean that men’s experience of pain is not severe or as valid as women’s. There are many variables which contribute to how an individual experiences pain and how it affects their lives. Pain is fundamentally subjective, and the levels of suffering that pain patients go through is dependant on many factors. These gender differences also do not mean that anyone’s experience of chronic pain is ‘lessened’ or invalid. Everybody’s experience is valid. Chronic pain is very real and debilitating, regardless of gender.
However the more the medical community understands the link between gender and how our bodies process pain, the more likely they are to develop appropriate treatments. Going forward as more research is done into gender differences, it should shape clinical practice for chronic pain so that pharmacological and psychological treatments can be tailored to give the optimum results for each individual. This study sums that point up nicely: “ our findings suggest the need to tailor rehabilitative strategies differently for men and women”.
Stigma must be broken down so that both genders are given access to the treatments they deserve. Medical professionals must be educated in regards to how to treat patients with chronic pain in general as well as specifically how to treat men and women. Compassion, knowledge and validation must take the place of misdiagnosis, invalidation and untreated chronic pain.

Abstract
Research consistently indicates that gender differences exist in pain perception, with females typically reporting more negative responses to pain than males. It also seems as if males and females use and benefit from different coping strategies when under stress; females seem to prefer emotion-focused coping, whereas males prefer sensory-focused coping. Unfortunately, experimental research that examines such differences in the context of pain has not yet been adequately investigated. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to determine whether gender differences would be found in the effect that sensory-focused and emotion-focused coping instructions have on cold pressor pain experiences. Participants consisted of 24 male and 26 female healthy adults, all of whom reported no current pain. A consistent pattern of effects was found, over both behavioural and self-report measures of pain. Compared to females, males exhibited less negative pain responses when focusing on the sensory component of pain (i.e. increased threshold, tolerance and lower sensory pain). Furthermore, compared to sensory focusing, emotional focusing was found to increase the affective pain experience of females. Together these results confirm that important differences exist between men and women in the effects pain coping instructions have on the experience of pain. The implications of such findings for research and practice are discussed.

Women feel pain more intensely than men, according to a new study of 11,000 men and women who were patients at the Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
Researchers analyzed electronic medical records of patients’ reports of pain across a range of different diseases, and found a distinct gender-driven difference in how much discomfort patients say they felt. The study included 47 disorders — from cancer to back conditions and infectious diseases — and more than 161,000 patient-reported pain scores. The patients were all asked by nurses or other health personnel to rate their pain on an 11-point scale, with 0 representing “no pain” and 11 signifying the “worst pain imaginable.”

Not surprisingly, most responses clustered around either the two extremes of very little pain or extreme pain or the middle score of 5. But overall, women were more likely to indicate higher pain levels than men, says lead author Dr. Atul Butte, chief of systems medicine in the department of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. And that was true across almost all of the different diseases. “That was the most surprising finding,” says Butte. “We completely wouldn’t have expected such a difference across almost all disorders, where women were reporting a whole pain point higher on the 0-to-10 scale than men.”
Of course, self-reports can’t account for the fact that people may define tolerable and intolerable pain in vastly different ways, says Butte, but the fact that a gender difference emerged from such a large number of patients suggests that the effect is real.

What accounts for the gender gap? Hormones may explain some of the difference — studies have shown that estrogen in women can help dampen the activity of pain receptors, helping them to tolerate higher levels of pain. That means, however, that they may become more sensitive to pain during low-estrogen parts of the menstrual cycle.
There may also be explanations that have nothing to do with biology. Men, for example, may feel compelled by cultural stereotypes to be tough, and therefore report feeling less pain than they really do —especially when asked by the mostly female nursing staff.
Still, even if non-biological factors are influencing how much pain men and women report, Butte says the difference is worth noting. “The reasons may be biological or they may not be, but we should still be aware of the bias that patients have in reporting pain,” he says. He is hoping to continue the research by following up these results with surveys of patients’ ratings after they were treated for pain. That may help doctors to better address the real pain patients may be feeling.

Alright, I've got a bunch of information here from different sources. Let me try to make sense of it all.

So, the question is whether women experience pain differently than men. From what I've read, it seems like there are some notable differences. One article mentioned that women generally report higher levels of pain and more distress related to pain compared to men. Another study found that women have lower pain thresholds and higher sensitivity to experimental pain.

First, I need to understand what's meant by "pain threshold" and "pain sensitivity." Pain threshold refers to the minimum intensity of a stimulus required to elicit a pain response, while pain sensitivity is related to how strongly pain is perceived at a given stimulus intensity. So, if women have lower pain thresholds, that means they start feeling pain at lower levels of stimulus intensity compared to men. And higher sensitivity means that for the same intensity of stimulus, women perceive the pain as more intense.

But, I should consider whether these differences are biological or influenced by social and cultural factors. One article mentioned that biological factors, including sex hormones and endogenous pain control mechanisms, play a role. It also highlighted psychological and sociocultural factors, such as gender role expectations of pain.

Hormones seem to be an important aspect here. Estrogen and progesterone in women can influence pain perception. Some studies suggest that estrogen can modulate the density of opioid receptors and influence neurotransmitters involved in pain processing. There's also mention that during certain phases of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels fluctuate, women may experience increased pain sensitivity.

On the other hand, men have higher levels of testosterone, which has been found to have pain-inhibiting effects. So, perhaps men have a natural advantage in terms of pain tolerance due to higher testosterone levels.

But it's not just biological; there are psychological and social factors at play too. For example, women may be socialized to express emotions and pain more openly, while men might be encouraged to be stoic and忍耐 pain. This could influence how they report pain in medical settings.

One study mentioned that men and women use different coping strategies for pain. Women tend to use more emotional and social support strategies, while men prefer more active approaches. This could affect not only how they deal with pain but also how they perceive and report it.

Moreover, there's evidence that men and women process pain differently in the brain. Brain imaging studies have shown differences in neural activation patterns in response to pain stimuli between genders. For instance, women may engage more emotional processing areas of the brain when experiencing pain, which could contribute to greater pain perception and distress.

Another interesting point is that women have higher nerve densities in certain areas, like facial skin, which could make them more sensitive to painful stimuli. However, some researchers argue that central pain processing differences are more significant than nerve density in explaining gender disparities in pain experience.

Additionally, women are more likely to experience chronic pain conditions, which might be related to hormonal influences and immune system differences.

When it comes to pain treatment, there are differences in how men and women respond to pain medications. For example, women may require lower doses of opioids for pain relief due to higher sensitivity to these drugs. This could be due to differences in opioid receptor activity in the brain.

It's also important to consider that women and men may be treated differently by healthcare providers based on gender biases. There's evidence that women's pain reports are sometimes taken less seriously or dismissed more readily than men's, leading to disparities in pain management.

Given all this information, it seems clear that there are indeed differences in how women and men experience and report pain. These differences are likely multifactorial, involving biological, psychological, and social components.

So, to answer the question: Yes, women do experience pain differently than men, generally reporting higher levels of pain and greater sensitivity to painful stimuli. This is influenced by a combination of hormonal, neurological, and sociocultural factors.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, women experience pain differently than men, generally reporting higher levels of pain and greater sensitivity to painful stimuli due to a combination of hormonal, neurological, and sociocultural factors.}} \]
