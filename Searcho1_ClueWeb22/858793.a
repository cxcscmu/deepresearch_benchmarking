So I need to figure out how Lawrence Henry Gipson viewed the American Revolution. I don't know much about this guy, so I should probably start by finding out who he was and what he's known for.

First, I'll do a search to learn about Lawrence Henry Gipson.

Born in Bellaire, Ohio to the late "Ike” Henry Isaac Hess and Beverly Ann Makofsky Hess. Also preceded in death by his Brother and Son who both share the name David William Hess. He is survived by 3 Brothers Ronald, Marvin and Alan Hess and their dear Sister Karen Hess Coen.
He was the beloved Husband of Sandra Gillespie Hess for nearly 45 years, and the best Father to Kimberly Hess Niederhuber who will always treasure the time they spent together. His Son-in-Law, Erik Niederhuber, and Grandchildren, Tiden Hess, Abigail and Andrew Niederhuber all agree he was a very remarkable spiritual man, a positive influence and always encouraging. Tiden was especially close to him and feels his Pap was a loving caring friend and a father to him.
Truly a friend to all he met. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him well. Some called him Brother, some Larry or Uncle Larry, others Pap or Dad. However, for 50 years the role he served above all else was to be a Witness of Jehovah God. He firmly believed nothing could separate him from God’s love, not even death. (Romans 8:38&39)
All are welcome to attend the memorial service Nov 6 th at 3:00 via zoom. Visitation with the family will be 30 minutes before and after the service. Please call or text 304-551-6246 to get the login information.

Hmm, none of these search results are about Lawrence Henry Gipson. It seems like there might be a mistake in the search query. Maybe I should try a more specific search term.

Let me try searching for "Lawrence Henry Gipson American Revolution."

Lawrence H. Gipson
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Lawrence Henry Gipson (1880 – September 26, 1971) was an American historian, who won the 1950 Bancroft Prize and the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for History for volumes of his magnum opus, the fifteen-volume history of "The British Empire Before the American Revolution", published 1936–70.  He was a leader of the "Imperial school" of historians who studied the British Empire from the perspective of London, and generally praised the administrative efficiency and political fairness of the Empire.

Career[edit]
A native of Greeley, Colorado, Gipson moved with his family to Caldwell, Idaho, as a boy. After dropping out of high school, he worked at various odd jobs (such as mining and driving stage coaches), as well as at the family business, Caxton Press, which published Idaho Odd Fellow, the Gem State Rural and Livestock Farmer .
Gipson graduated from the University of Idaho in 1903. He was then selected to be one of the first Rhodes Scholars. Receiving his B.A. from Oxford University in 1907 he said: "One disadvantage that our first delegation of Rhodes Scholars labored under was the fact that we attracted so much attention. I am sure that no subsequent group was ever the object of such intense curiosity. Almost inevitably we were made conscious that each of us was on trial, especially in the eyes of the scholarly world. We were even made to feel that in a sense the reputation of American scholarship was in our hands."
Returning to the United States, Gipson taught at The College of Idaho for three years and, in 1909, married Jeannette Reed (who died in 1967). He then attended Yale University as a Farnham Fellow from 1910 to 1911 before being named head of the history department at Wabash College, a position he held until 1924. While teaching at Wabash, he received his Ph.D. from Yale University, in 1918.  He studied with the eminent colonialist Charles M. Andrews and received the university's John Addison Porter Prize for that year. [1]
Historian[edit]
In 1924, Gipson was appointed professor of history at Lehigh University, a position he held until his death. Although best known as a historian of Colonial America and its place in the British Empire, two of Gipson's earliest articles had to do with the Civil War and Reconstruction. His assessment of Andrew Johnson ("The Statesmanship of President Johnson: A Study of the Presidential Reconstruction Policy") was published in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review in December 1915; and "The Collapse of the Confederacy" appeared in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review in March 1918. His Yale doctoral dissertation, which was written under the guidance of Charles M. Andrews, was accepted in 1918 and published two years later by Yale University Press as Jared Ingersoll: A Study of American Loyalism in Relation to British Colonial Government (1920), for which he received the Justin Winsor Prize from the American Historical Association. He contributed seven entries to the Dictionary of American Biography, and three articles to the Dictionary of American History .
Gipson's magnum opus was the fifteen-volume series The British Empire Before the American Revolution (15 vols., 1936–70) - the first three volumes were published by The Caxton Printers in Caldwell, Idaho, and the remaining volumes were published by Alfred A. Knopf in New York. Gipson spent decades on the project, completing the final volume only shortly before his death. Three of the volumes were given significant historical prizes:
The Great War for the Empire: The Years of Defeat, 1754-1757 (volume 6): The 1948 Columbia University Loubat Prize
The Great War for the Empire: The Victorious Years, 1758-1760 (volume 7): The 1950 Bancroft Prize of Columbia University
The Triumphant Empire: Thunderclouds Gather in the West, 1763-1766 (volume 10): The 1962 Pulitzer Prize in History
Gipson believed that the American Revolution was a direct result of changes that occurred in the British Empire after 1763, due to Britain's victory in the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War, which he referred to as "The Great War for the Empire." His thesis is succinctly presented in his article "The American Revolution as an Aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754-1763," which was published in the March 1950 issue of Political Science Quarterly. He paid tribute to his mentor in "Charles McLean Andrews and the Re-orientation of the Study of American Colonial History," which appeared in the July 1935 issue of the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography .
One of Gipson's last publications was the introduction to a 1969 Festschrift for Ross J. S. Hoffman, who was a history professor at Fordham University. Gipson noted that he himself was a member of the Congregational Church and a descendant of the pilgrim William Brewster, while Hoffman was a convert to Roman Catholicism and a staunch defender of that faith - and yet they were good friends.
Gipson died on September 26, 1971, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; his ashes were buried in Caldwell. He left his entire estate to Lehigh University, providing the core funding for the Gipson Institute .

Grenville, George
George Grenville (1712-1770)
George Grenville, best known as the driving political force behind the Stamp Act, was born October 14, 1712, the son of Richard Grenville, a Buckinghamshire member of Parliament, and Hester Temple.  His elder brother was Richard, Earl Temple. He was educated at Eton; Christ College, Oxford; and the Inner Temple. He was called to the London bar in 1735 and actively practiced law until his election to Parliament in 1741. There he became, with William Pitt and others close to his mother's family, one of the "Boy Patriots" in opposition to Sir Robert Walpole's administration.  Grenville entered the Pelham ministry in 1744 as a member of the Admiralty board.  He was shifted to the Treasury board in 1751, where he remained for seven years and became an expert on national and imperial finances.  The personal and political bonds between Grenville and Pitt became even closer in 1754 when Pitt married Grenville's sister, Hester.
Grenville was in and out of office during the shifting administrations that marked the end of George II's long reign and the beginning of George III's.  What also shifted were Grenville's political alliances as he drifted away from Pitt and closer to those allied with the household of the Prince of Wales in the 1750s, a process of changing allegiances that continued after the prince's accession to the throne in 1760.  In 1762 Grenville entered Lord Bute's ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, with responsibility for southern Europe and the American colonies, a position that put him in direct opposition to Pitt.  Although his tenure in the office could hardly be considered a success, Grenville took over the ministry when he succeeded Lord Bute as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer in April 1763, mainly because there was no one else acceptable to the King.
Grenville's name began to acquire a negative sheen in America in 1764 when he waged war against John Wilkes, a member of Parliament, in the House of Commons for Wilkes' publication of The North Briton No. 45, which virulently and personally attacked the King.  For Grenville and his secretaries of state, the issue was one of libel against the King, for which Wilkes deserved to be prosecuted.  For Pitt and many others in and out of Parliament, the question was the legality of the general warrants used by the secretaries of state to arrest Wilkes, his printers, and their assistants, along with the seizure of Wilkes' papers, personal and public.  While Grenville battled Pitt in the Commons over Wilkes' privilege as a member of Parliament and his expulsion from that body, the courts declared general warrants unconstitutional. This combination of events made Grenville's once considerable majorities in the house dwindle to double figures when it came to votes regarding Wilkes.
Grenville then turned his attention to the matter that would make his name anathema in the colonies: the imposition of colonial taxes to finance the army stationed there for the Americans' protection.  He first passed the Sugar Act in April 1764, which was intended to raise a money by increasing enforcement of the duty on the importation of foreign molasses to the American colonies while at the same time cutting the six pence per gallon duty in half. In Massachusetts Bay, where merchants believed it would hurt Boston legal (and illegal) trade with the West Indies, political leaders were furious.  Samuel Adams and James Otis argued that it invaded the colony's charter rights to govern themselves, that "no parts of His Majesty's Dominions can be taxed without their consent," and "that every part has a right to be represented." (James Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved ).  On the other hand, Virginia's interests in London appear to have not cared less about the question.  One of them reported back to the Chesapeake that "Mr. G[renville] cut your throats with a feather" in the Sugar Act debate.
Grenville's next step was the introduction of an American Stamp Bill, under consideration since September 1763 and first introduced in the Commons in March 1764.  Grenville had the measure withdrawn when an objection was raised that the colonies should be consulted.  He therefore postponed the measure to give the colonies time to respond and propose alternatives.  Although colonial agents in London, such as Benjamin Franklin and George Mercer, assured him that Americans would accept a stamp tax on newspapers, legal and shipping documents, and a few other items (which had been paid in Britain for a century), Grenville's plan was greeted with protests.  In the summer of 1764, the Virginia legislature's Committee of Correspondence directed their agent in London to "insist on the Injustice of laying any Duties on us and particularly taxing the internal Trade of the Colony without their Consent."  Paying the duty would also be a heavy burden to the people because they were "already laden with debts."  In January 1765, Grenville made an offer to the Americans: the stamp duty would be laid aside if they proposed another mode of contributing the funds.  Colonial agents in London rejected the offer out of hand, following the instructions of their assemblies to question the right claimed by Parliament to tax the colonies at all.  Without an alternative, Grenville re-introduced the bill on February 6, 1765.  Except for a memorable exchange between William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth, and Isaac Barré, the bill passed the House of Commons the next day "almost without debate" (according to a contemporary historian), by a vote 205-49.  It was ratified by royal assent on March 22, 1765.
Grenville was no longer in office when the howls of Americans reached London ears.  By 1765, the relationship between Grenville and George III had deteriorated to the point of discord.  Grenville was dismissed from office on July 10, 1765, and he almost immediately went to active opposition to both the King and to American defiance of the Stamp Act, comparing it to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.  He remained in Parliament until his death in London on November 13, 1770.

Main article: History of New Jersey
As the location of many major battles, New Jersey was pivotal in the American Revolution and the ultimate victory of the American colonists. This important role earned it the title of Crossroads of the American Revolution.[1]
Not all of the population of New Jersey advocated independence; Governor William Franklin, the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, was a loyalist who supported the Stamp Act. Many of the colonists had emigrated from England and felt a sense of loyalty to the King of England and the English government. On January 8, 1776, Governor Franklin was arrested for opposing the Revolution. Others such as slaves joined sides with the British in return for promises of freedom. For example, Colonel Tye was a slave who escaped and joined the British army, leading constant raids against the people of New Jersey. [2]
Throughout the Revolutionary War, there were many clashes between the Americans and British within the colony of New Jersey. In total, there were 296 engagements that occurred within New Jersey, more clashes than occurred in any other colony during the war.

Prewar tensions[edit]
Following the French and Indian War, tensions erupted between the Americans and the British, in part, over who should pay for the war that resulted in the immense territorial gains for the British with their conquest of Quebec and French Canada. After Parliament issued the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Tea Act, furious protests and outbreaks occurred. One such outbreak occurred in Greenwich Township, New Jersey in Cumberland County. On December 22, 1774, a group of 40 colonists entered the cellar of loyalist Daniel Bowen and quickly stole and burned chests of tea. [3]
Declaration of Independence[edit]
Main article: United States Declaration of Independence
New Jersey representatives Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, and Abraham Clark were among the men who signed the United States Declaration of Independence. These men, just like all the others, took tremendous risks in order to fight for independence and all went on to serve their newly founded country for the rest of their lives. Distinguished lawyer Richard Stockton, New Jersey-born and College of New Jersey graduate, sacrificed his royal judicial title and his considerable international economic interest in order to be an elected delegate for New Jersey at the General Congress. John Witherspoon was a Scottish immigrant. He came to New Jersey to serve as the sixth president of the College of New Jersey. He was a world-renowned Presbyterian minister and became a leading member of the Continental Congress. Witherspoon went on to become one of the leaders of the new national Presbyterian church. Francis Hopkinson was somewhat of a renaissance man for his time. He was articulate in several fields of the arts and a very impressive scientist. Perhaps the capstone of his career was his appointment by President George Washington to the federal bench. John Hart was a prominent landowner and judge of the Hunterdon County court. Like Stockton, he sacrificed his high standing with the royal court and dedicated his life to the New Jersey Assembly. After signing the Declaration of Independence, he went on to become the speaker of the New Jersey Assembly. The last of the men, Abraham Clark, was native to Elizabethtown. He was slightly different from his fellow New Jersey representatives as he jumped from job to job working as a farmer, surveyor, transporter, legal adviser, and finally politician. He was well liked in all these fields and had become a prominent member of society, but he found his home in government. He held numerous political positions at all the various levels of government.
Battles[edit]
Main article: New York and New Jersey campaign
Besides being the location of several important battles, New Jersey was also helpful in disrupting British supply units. Forts on the Delaware River could attack British supply troops as they sailed to Philadelphia. Men in whaleboats crossed the Hudson and raided New York City and Long Island, and captured shipping in the Sandy Hook staging area outside New York Harbor. Ships based in south Jersey ports raided British shipping at sea.
New Jersey also had several ironworks that provide iron and iron products, such as cannon, for the war effort, besides its food production. The Ford family in Morristown ran a black powder mill that supplied needed powder for the early war effort.
The Continental army encamped three years in New Jersey, in the winters of 1777 at Morristown, 1778–79 at Middlebrook (near Bound Brook), and in 1780 again at Morristown. Large parts of the Continental forces wintered in other years in NJ.
Raids from British-held New York City from across the Hudson into New Jersey happened very frequently. The British sent men into New Jersey looking for supplies, firewood, cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, and looking to capture leading patriots.
Battle of Fort Lee[edit]
Main article: Fort Lee Historic Park
Depiction by Thomas Davies of the British invasion at the Palisades on the morning of November 20, 1776, near Fort Lee, New Jersey.
The war did not start well for the Continental Army. After difficult losses in the Battle of Brooklyn, General George Washington led his troops towards Manhattan with the British in pursuit. On November 16, 1776, Fort Washington, at the northern tip of Manhattan Island, fell to the British.
On the morning of November 20, 1776, British soldiers under Charles Cornwallis captured Fort Lee after a hasty retreat by the American soldiers stationed there under the command of General Nathanael Greene. After gaining control of the Manhattan area, the British ferried up the Hudson River in barges. Washington had dashed off to warn the Americans about the advancing British, and the fort was evacuated. Much equipment and supplies were captured by the British.
Washington then led his 2,000 troops from Fort Lee in a retreat through present-day Englewood and Teaneck across the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing. Washington continued his retreat through early December, passing through Princeton on the way to the Delaware River .
Ten Crucial Days[edit]
Military map by William Faden with troop movements during the Ten Crucial Days
The "Ten Crucial Days" were the days from December 25, 1776 to January 3, 1777, when several decisive battles, namely the battles of Trenton, Assunpink Creek and Princeton, were fought between the Continental Army under George Washington and the British army, mostly under Charles Cornwallis.[4] Washington badly needed a victory to prove his army's hope of winning and thus boost morale. It is considered[by whom?] as one of the most significant military offensives in history. According to George Otto Trevelyan: "It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world." Frederick the Great called them “the most brilliant in the world’s history.” President Coolidge called them “a military exploit of unparalleled brilliancy."
Battle of Trenton[edit]
Main article: Battle of Trenton
The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776
by John Trumbull
On the night of December 25–26, 1776, the Continental Army under the command of General George Washington made their crossing of the Delaware River. They took the Hessians stationed in Trenton by surprise; the Hessians were not prepared for an attack during a bad storm. In the ensuing Battle of Trenton in the morning of December 26, the Continental Army defeated the Hessians. The Americans attacked in groups, one down the two main streets from the North east, the other along the river road. The American cannons denied the Hessians the ability to form up in the streets. The Hessians unsuccessfully attempted to retreat and were completely surrounded by the Continental Army. As a result of the battle, the Americans captured nearly 900 Hessian soldiers within 90 minutes. In addition, they took the supplies that had been placed in Trenton for use by the British army. Washington then had the soldiers recross safely back into Pennsylvania. The battle helped to increase the waning confidence of the Continental Congress .
Battle of the Assunpink Creek[edit]
Main article: Battle of the Assunpink Creek
On January 2, 1777, Cornwallis had hoped to engage Washington's army at Trenton after George Washington recrossed the Delaware River, resulting in the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Cornwallis's initial results were failures. After recapturing Trenton, he ordered charges on defenses fortified by Washington at Assunpink Creek. The Americans, from their defenses, fired volleys at the advancing troops, striking heavy casualties in the British army. Later that night, Washington moved the majority of his army on a surprise attack upon British troops stationed at Princeton. At the same time, he left a few troops to stall Cornwallis by creating false signals (campfires, loud noises, fortification repair) to give the impression that the Continental Army was still stationed in Trenton.
Battle of Princeton[edit]
Main article: Battle of Princeton
The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777
by John Trumbull
On January 3, 1777, the Continental Army commanded by Washington defeated the British army under Cornwallis at the Battle of Princeton .
The initial contact at Princeton was between General Hugh Mercer 's advance corp moving toward the Stoney Brook along Quaker Bridge road, against British Col. Charles Mawhood, who was leading most of the 55th regiment and other additional troops toward Trenton. As Mawhood crossed the Stoney Brook, both sides spotted the other. Both sides moved to a nearby hill above the Princeton Road (now US 206 ). Mawhood opened fire as the Americans came over the ridge, and followed with a bayonet charge. Mercer's men, armed mostly with rifles, were driven off, and Mercer was wounded by bayonets (he died several days later). More American militia moved up to engage Mercer, while another column led by General Sullivan moved on the town from the south.
The advancing Militia were also repelled by Mawhood's regiment, although Mawhood was outnumbered 3 or 4 to one, but he and his men stood steadfast. Washington himself lead up more Continentals and encouraged the militia to return to the fight. After a few volleys Mawhood was forced to retreat across the Stoney Brook.
After driving in a detachment of the 55th regiment, Sullivan marched into Princeton. Most of the remaining British forces retreated toward New Brunswick but some took up a defensive position in the stone university building, Nassau Hall.
The Americans set up cannons facing Nassau Hall of Princeton University, and two cannonballs made contact with the walls of the hall. The British soldiers at Princeton were soon forced to surrender to the Americans, and Nassau Hall was recaptured. Cornwallis immediately moved to bring his army to engage Washington. This attempt failed due to a delaying force which damaged the Stoney Point Bridge and delayed the British. These two victories, and the resulting resurgence of the militias from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and Connecticut, forced the British out of most of New Jersey, boosting the morale of the Americans. The British were soon forced into an enclave around New Brunswick, giving up the rest of New Jersey." [5]
The attempt of the British went to show the Americans that they could not fight. The British army had failed. The British now realized it would be a long war.
Battle of Millstone[edit]
Main article: Battle of Millstone
Also known as the battle of Van Nest's Mills, the Battle of Millstone occurred on January 20, 1777. Following the battle of Princeton, Washington's soldiers traveled north following the Millstone River to Somerset Court House (now Millstone, New Jersey ), then proceeded to Morristown.
From New Brunswick, a British foraging party of a few hundred men also went to Somerset Court House, reaching Van Nest’s Mill (present day Manville, New Jersey ). After seizing flour and livestock, the British unit set up defenses on the Millstone River, including 3 cannons. The militia posted in the area managed to surprise the British party by crossing the cold, waist deep, river and capture many men and to seize back the supplies.
General Dickinson Raritan, New Jersey, January 23: "I have the pleasure to inform you that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V. Nest Mills consisting of 500 men with 2 field pieces, which we routed after an engagement of 20 minutes and brought off 107 horses, 49 wagons, 115 cattle, 70 sheep, 40 barrels of flour - 106 bags and many other things, 49 prisoners."[6]
Battle of Bound Brook[edit]
Main article: Battle of Bound Brook
The Battle of Bound Brook resulted in a shallow defeat of the Americans stationed at Bound Brook, New Jersey on April 13, 1777. A four-prong attack by 4,000 British upon Bound Brook ensued, and the Americans, who put up a fierce resistance at first, retreated. Around 60 casualties occurred on the American side, while only a single British soldier was killed. On the same day, Nathanael Greene recaptured Bound Brook, but George Washington realized the difficulty of defending the place.
Battle of Short Hills[edit]
Main article: Battle of Short Hills
After advancing to Millstone, New Jersey, on June 26, 1777, General Howe found that Washington would not move his army out of the strong position on the Watchung Mountains north of Middlebrook. Planning to attack Philadelphia, but unable to go safely through New Jersey with its militia nipping away at his men, he had to move his men back to New Brunswick to board shipping.
As the British forces moved back, Washington had some generals move forward, looking for an opportunity to attack a weakened foe. When General Lord Stirling had moved his men to the Short Hills area, suddenly the hunter became the hunted when Howe sent a larger force to attack them.
The Americans, though hard pressed, managed to avoid being mangled or destroyed and fought a delaying battle while most of the American force escaped the trap.
Washington, who had finally moved out of the Watchung Mountains, moved back and ordered his commands around New Brunswick to do the same.
With the Americans moved away from his boarding troops, Howe was able to put his men aboard ships and abandon New Jersey in relative security. The British left New Brunswick and Staten Island to later attack Philadelphia. [7]
Battle of Monmouth[edit]
Main article: Battle of Monmouth
Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth
by Emanuel Leutze
In 1777, the British retreated to New York City to protect it from an expected French attack. Washington quickly ordered his soldiers to march towards the British and met them at the Battle of Monmouth.
On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army under George Washington met a British column under Sir Henry Clinton. George Washington hoped to surprise the rear of the British army and overwhelm them. General Charles Lee led the American attack on the British rear but retreated quickly when the British attempted to flank the Americans. The retreat nearly led to massive disorder, but Washington managed to personally rally the troops to withstand the British counterattacks. The British attempted two attacks to defeat the Americans; both failed. As exceedingly high temperatures continued to increase over 100 °F (38 °C), many soldiers fell to sunstroke. After the battle, Charles Lee was court martialed for his poor army command. Over 1,000 British casualties were incurred; the Americans lost about 452 men. This battle inspired the legend of Molly Pitcher.[8]
Baylor Massacre[edit]
Main article: Baylor Massacre
The Baylor Massacre was an attack on September 27, 1778 upon the 3rd Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons under the command of Colonel George Baylor during the American Revolutionary War. It occurred in the present day town of River Vale, New Jersey. During the night, they were betrayed by loyalists, who informed the British of their location. Using bayonets, the British killed, injured, or took as prisoners 67 of the dragoons.
Battle of Paulus Hook[edit]
Main article: Battle of Paulus Hook
Paulus Hook was a peninsula at what is now Jersey City, and a major landing point for anyone going from New York City into New Jersey. Since it was on the Hudson River, the British fleet was able to protect it. The British used it to send raiders into Bergen County. Militia tried to stand guard to prevent or harass these raiders.
The Battle of Paulus Hook was fought on August 19, 1779, between Colonial and British forces. The patriots were led by Light Horse Harry Lee, and launched a night attack on the British-controlled fort. They surprised the British, taking several prisoners, but had to withdraw before daylight when the British navy could react. The fort continued to be used as a base of operations against Bergen County patriots.
Battle of Connecticut Farms[edit]
Main article: Battle of Connecticut Farms
On June 6, 1780, British troops boarded boats on Staten Island bound for Elizabeth, New Jersey. At midnight, 5,000 troops started to land. They expected the Continental Army to give little resistance, believing that they were tired of the war and were poorly fed and paid. They also expected the citizens of New Jersey to welcome them. They were wrong on both counts.
Once they began to march into Elizabeth, they were attacked by Lt. Ogden, who was stationed to give an alarm outside of town with a small group of men. Ogden had orders to fire one volley and retreat. That volley wounded British General Stirling in the thigh, and delayed the advance several hours.
The New Jersey Brigade of the Continental Army, in and around Elizabeth, moved back toward Connecticut Farms, now Union Township, New Jersey, sending word to Morristown to the main army under Washington. The New Jersey brigade was heavily outnumbered. The warnings to the militia also went out, and they began to form up and march toward the British from as far away as Hopewell, New Jersey .
When the British did advance, they were attacked by the militia on the flanks. This drew off significant portions of their forces to protect their supply line and route of travel.
General William Maxwell, commanding the New Jersey Brigade, set up a defense at defiles on the road to Connecticut Farms. After a day of hot fighting, the British realized they could not easily breakthrough toward the Hobart Gap leading to Morristown, and, after burning the town, retired back to Elizabeth point.
Battle of Springfield[edit]
Main article: Battle of Springfield (1780)
The last major battle to take place in New Jersey and the rest of the Northern states during the Revolutionary War was the Battle of Springfield. Baron von Knyphausen, the Hessian general, hoped to invade New Jersey and expected support from the colonists of New Jersey who were tired of the war. His goal was to secure Hobart Gap, from which he could attack the American headquarters situated in Morristown. On June 23, 1780, the British attacked soldiers and militia under the command of Nathanael Greene. General Greene successfully stopped a two-pronged attack from positions held across the Rahway River. The victory prevented a British attack on Morristown and its military stores. Nathanael Greene's personal assistant was Thomas Paine.
Final Skirmishes of the American Revolution[edit]
Several small conflicts and skirmishes took place in New Jersey just before and after the Battle of Yorktown, representing the final conflicts of the American Revolution.  The Skirmish at Manahawkin took place on December 30 & 31, 1781 when militiamen clashed with John Bacon and approximately 30 and 40 men, resulting in one death and one injury. [9] [10]
In October 25, 1782, after formal hostilities between the United States and Great Britain had paused, Bacon and his men murdered 19 men in their sleep, including Patriot militia Captain Andrew Steelman, in what is known as the Long Beach Island Massacre. [11]
On December 9, 1782, Lieutenant Nicholas Morgan, age 28, was guarding the shore of South Amboy when he was ambushed by Loyalist "refugees" from New York.[12] Morgan may have been the last officer of the Continental Army to die in the American Revolution .
The Affair at Cedar Bridge in Barnegat Township was the last conflict between British allied forces of the American Revolution which took place in December 1782. One Patriot was killed, and four were wounded. Four Loyalists were wounded, including Bacon. [13]
Support and encouragement generated by newspaper[edit]
The New Jersey Journal became the second newspaper published in the state. It was edited and printed by Shepard Kollock, who established his press in Chatham during 1779. This paper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events regarding the war came directly to the editor from Washington's headquarters in nearby Morristown to boost the morale of the troops and their families, and as editor, he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. Kollock later relocated the paper twice, first to New Brunswick when the military action shifted there, and later in 1785, when he established his last publication location in Elizabeth under the same name. The Journal ceased publication in 1992.
Original New Jersey State Constitution[edit]
Wikisource has original text related to this article:
New Jersey Constitution of 1776
Main article: New Jersey State Constitution
In 1776, the first New Jersey State Constitution was drafted. It was written during the period of the Revolutionary War, and was designed to create a basic framework for the state government. The constitution recognized the right of suffrage for women and black men who met certain property requirements. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 gives the vote to "all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money." This included blacks, spinsters, and widows. (Married women could not own property under the common law .) It had been held that this was an accident of hasty drafting: the British were at Staten Island when the constitution was proclaimed. The Constitution declares itself temporary, and it was to be void if there was reconciliation with Great Britain.[14]
Both sides in elections mocked the other for relying on "petticoat electors" and each accused the other of letting unqualified women (including married women) vote. A Federalist legislature passed a voting rights act which applied only to those counties where the Federalists were strong. A Democratic legislature extended it to the entire state. In 1807, as a side-effect of a reconciliation within the Democratic Party, the legislature reinterpreted the constitution (which had been an ordinary act of the Provincial Congress) to mean universal white male suffrage, with no property requirement. However, they disenfranchised paupers, to suppress the Irish vote.
After the war[edit]
In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall of Princeton University. It had originally convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but mutinous troops prevented the meeting from taking place there. Princeton became the temporary capital for the newly independent nation through these four months. During the brief stay in Princeton, the Continental Congress was informed of the end of the war by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. The chief dignitary of the meeting was George Washington, and a portrait was made of Washington during the meeting. On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the Constitution. On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state in the nation to ratify the Bill of Rights .
New Jersey played a principal role in creating the structure of the new United States Government. When Virginia delegates came up with the Virginia Plan, which called for representation in government proportional to the population of each state, the smaller states refused, fearing that with such a plan they would no longer have a say in government affairs. William Paterson, a New Jersey statesman, introduced the New Jersey Plan by which one vote would be given to each state, providing equal representation within the legislative body. Under the Great Compromise, both plans were placed into use with two separate bodies in the Congress, with the Senate being modeled after the structure in the New Jersey Plan.

<|end_search_result|>

Okay, I think I've found the right person now. From the first search result, it seems that Lawrence Henry Gipson was an American historian who specialized in the study of the British Empire, particularly before the American Revolution. He wrote a 15-volume history called "The British Empire Before the American Revolution," which seems to be his magnum opus.

I need to find out how he viewed the American Revolution. According to one of the search results, Gipson believed that the American Revolution was a direct result of changes that occurred in the British Empire after 1763, following Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, which he referred to as "The Great War for the Empire." He seemed to argue that the empire underwent significant transformations post-1763, and these changes led to the revolution.

Another search result mentions that Gipson was part of the "Imperial school" of historians, who generally viewed the British Empire positively, praising its administrative efficiency and political fairness. So, perhaps his perspective on the American Revolution was influenced by this overall positive view of the British Empire.

I should look deeper into his works to understand his perspective better. Maybe I can find summaries or analyses of his 15-volume history.

Let me try searching for more specific information on Gipson's views on the American Revolution.

The American Revolution

People
Grenville, George
George Grenville (1712-1770)
George Grenville, best known as the driving political force behind the Stamp Act, was born October 14, 1712, the son of Richard Grenville, a Buckinghamshire member of Parliament, and Hester Temple.  His elder brother was Richard, Earl Temple. He was educated at Eton; Christ College, Oxford; and the Inner Temple. He was called to the London bar in 1735 and actively practiced law until his election to Parliament in 1741. There he became, with William Pitt and others close to his mother's family, one of the "Boy Patriots" in opposition to Sir Robert Walpole's administration.  Grenville entered the Pelham ministry in 1744 as a member of the Admiralty board.  He was shifted to the Treasury board in 1751, where he remained for seven years and became an expert on national and imperial finances.  The personal and political bonds between Grenville and Pitt became even closer in 1754 when Pitt married Grenville's sister, Hester.
Grenville was in and out of office during the shifting administrations that marked the end of George II's long reign and the beginning of George III's.  What also shifted were Grenville's political alliances as he drifted away from Pitt and closer to those allied with the household of the Prince of Wales in the 1750s, a process of changing allegiances that continued after the prince's accession to the throne in 1760.  In 1762 Grenville entered Lord Bute's ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, with responsibility for southern Europe and the American colonies, a position that put him in direct opposition to Pitt.  Although his tenure in the office could hardly be considered a success, Grenville took over the ministry when he succeeded Lord Bute as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer in April 1763, mainly because there was no one else acceptable to the King.
Grenville's name began to acquire a negative sheen in America in 1764 when he waged war against John Wilkes, a member of Parliament, in the House of Commons for Wilkes' publication of The North Briton No. 45, which virulently and personally attacked the King.  For Grenville and his secretaries of state, the issue was one of libel against the King, for which Wilkes deserved to be prosecuted.  For Pitt and many others in and out of Parliament, the question was the legality of the general warrants used by the secretaries of state to arrest Wilkes, his printers, and their assistants, along with the seizure of Wilkes' papers, personal and public.  While Grenville battled Pitt in the Commons over Wilkes' privilege as a member of Parliament and his expulsion from that body, the courts declared general warrants unconstitutional. This combination of events made Grenville's once considerable majorities in the house dwindle to double figures when it came to votes regarding Wilkes.
Grenville then turned his attention to the matter that would make his name anathema in the colonies: the imposition of colonial taxes to finance the army stationed there for the Americans' protection.  He first passed the Sugar Act in April 1764, which was intended to raise a money by increasing enforcement of the duty on the importation of foreign molasses to the American colonies while at the same time cutting the six pence per gallon duty in half. In Massachusetts Bay, where merchants believed it would hurt Boston legal (and illegal) trade with the West Indies, political leaders were furious.  Samuel Adams and James Otis argued that it invaded the colony's charter rights to govern themselves, that "no parts of His Majesty's Dominions can be taxed without their consent," and "that every part has a right to be represented." (James Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved ).  On the other hand, Virginia's interests in London appear to have not cared less about the question.  One of them reported back to the Chesapeake that "Mr. G[renville] cut your throats with a feather" in the Sugar Act debate.
Grenville's next step was the introduction of an American Stamp Bill, under consideration since September 1763 and first introduced in the Commons in March 1764.  Grenville had the measure withdrawn when an objection was raised that the colonies should be consulted.  He therefore postponed the measure to give the colonies time to respond and propose alternatives.  Although colonial agents in London, such as Benjamin Franklin and George Mercer, assured him that Americans would accept a stamp tax on newspapers, legal and shipping documents, and a few other items (which had been paid in Britain for a century), Grenville's plan was greeted with protests.  In the summer of 1764, the Virginia legislature's Committee of Correspondence directed their agent in London to "insist on the Injustice of laying any Duties on us and particularly taxing the internal Trade of the Colony without their Consent."  Paying the duty would also be a heavy burden to the people because they were "already laden with debts."  In January 1765, Grenville made an offer to the Americans: the stamp duty would be laid aside if they proposed another mode of contributing the funds.  Colonial agents in London rejected the offer out of hand, following the instructions of their assemblies to question the right claimed by Parliament to tax the colonies at all.  Without an alternative, Grenville re-introduced the bill on February 6, 1765.  Except for a memorable exchange between William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth, and Isaac Barré, the bill passed the House of Commons the next day "almost without debate" (according to a contemporary historian), by a vote 205-49.  It was ratified by royal assent on March 22, 1765.
Grenville was no longer in office when the howls of Americans reached London ears.  By 1765, the relationship between Grenville and George III had deteriorated to the point of discord.  Grenville was dismissed from office on July 10, 1765, and he almost immediately went to active opposition to both the King and to American defiance of the Stamp Act, comparing it to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.  He remained in Parliament until his death in London on November 13, 1770.

History  /  United States
One difficulty in writing a balanced history of the American Revolution arises in part from its success as a creator of our nation and our nationalistic sentiment. Unlike the Civil War, unlike the French Revolution, the American Revolution produced no lingering social trauma in the United States—it is a historic event widely applauded by Americans today as both necessary and desirable. But one consequence of this happy unanimity is that the chief losers of the War of Independence—the American Loyalists—have fared badly at the hands of historians. This explains, in part, why the account of the Revolution recorded by self-professed Loyalist and Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, Peter Oliver, has heretofore been so routinely overlooked.
Oliver's manuscript, entitled "The Origins & Progress of the American Rebellion," written in 1781, challenges the motives of the founding fathers, and depicts the revolution as passion, plotting, and violence. His descriptions of the leaders of the patriot party, of their program and motives, are unforgiving, bitter, and inevitably partisan. But it records the impressions of one who had experienced these events, knew most of the combatants intimately, and saw the collapse of the society he had lived in. His history is a very important contemporary account of the origins of the revolution in Massachusetts, and is now presented here in it entirety for the first time.

Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?
Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?
| No Comments
From the time after the American Revolution to present day, historians have debated whether the American Revolution was Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary. Two views formed from this question. Some historians see
the revolution as based on the desire of independence from Britain. Others argue the Revolution happened because of a “violent social upheaval”. These historians say the lower classes during the colonial era wanted a more democratic society. From these views, five schools of though developed.
The nationalist or patriotic school was the first one to develop after the Revolution. The theme of this this school was that “American history was the quest for liberty.” They believe the Revolution was solely to achieve the goal of self-rule. Due to the time period of when this school was developed its probable that the schools views were because of the lingering feelings of patriotism and nationalism. George Brancroft was a historian during the time of the schools development he saw that the American Revolution was a phase in a plan that when completed would bring all of humankind to greater freedom.
In the late 1800’s America and Britain were having good relations. Historians began to look at the past relations (between Britain and the colony’s) and see things differently. This is when the Imperial school developed. The Imperial school believed that political and constitutional issues caused the revolution. The Imperial school included historians George L. Beer, Charles M. Andrews and Lawrence H. Gipson. These historians said that the revolutionary views could not be limited to the history of America alone but “considered as an integral part of the history of the British Empire as a whole” These historians claimed that Britain was more fair than the nationalist and patriotic school had made Britain to be. They believed that under British rule British rule the colonies had actually been prosperous. Andrews stated that the British protected “America’s goods and ships.” Gipson argues that the taxation of the colonies was fair because of the fact the British blood was spilt and British money was spent “defending the North American colonies in the Great War for Empires.” However, Beer, Andrews, and Gipson believe that “constitutional issues” brought the disagreement between Britain and the colonies. They say Britain and the colonies clashed as the colonies pushed for different goals, the colonies moving toward self-government while the British pushed for more control over the colonies. Concluding that despite the Beer, Andrews and Gipson’s softer view of Britain during the colonial milestone the Imperial school still believed that the American Revolution was revolutionary. World War II brought the Neo-Conservative school of historians.
The Progressive school was the first school to see a completely different point of view; they believed that the revolution was a result of economic and social issues. These historians emphasized the conflicts between the lower and upper classes. Historians of this school were devoted to the “reform movement of the early 1900’s” they, themselves wanted to break away from large corporations of “modern America”. Looking back at the time of the colonial America, they saw many similarities between the two timeframes. Progressive historians, Carl L. Becker, Charles A. Beard, Arthur M. Schlesinger and J Franklin Jameson believed “materialistic factors – not ideological- were the major determinists in history.” Progressive historians believed that mostly self-economic interests motivated man. They argued that any political interest was a result of an economic interest. Becker said the American Revolution was actually two revolutions. The first revolution was an “external revolution”. Being when the colonies rebelled because of a “clash of economic interests” between Britain and the colonies. The second Revolution was an “Internal conflict”. This being between the colonies upper and lower classes, to determine which class would rule after gaining independence from the British. In other words two questions. “The question of home rule” and the question of “who should rule at home”. Beard came up with a hypothesis that the events during the era “mirrored a split between American society”, being conflicts between “rich and poor” and the “creditors and debtors”, between the haves and the have-nots. Schlesinger argues that merchants got angry about the British policies enforced after the French and Indian war, though they failed to act against the British for fear the might loser power to the lower classes. After independence, however they became active members in newly developed government and created the constitution to help gain “control of the government”.
World War II brought upon a new school being the neo-conservative school. They, unlike the progressive school believed the American society during the colonial era was democratic and that the Revolution was “conservative act“, initiated in order to preserve the life the colonists had began to live. When the British began to enforce laws in the colonies after the period of governing themselves the colonists rebelled.  Historians of this school argue that the freedoms of people were based on principles that should not be changed without there approval. Robert E. Brown and Daniel J. Boortsin saw the harmony and the widespread compromise to keep the government that the colonies had already established, that there was not a class struggle. They said the colonies had no intent to change the government after they gained independence from Britain to “maintain the status quo. Boorstin says that when Britain tried to tax them for the French and Indian war it contradicted the British constitution. When the colonists would not pay taxation without representation, they were protecting a right they already had. Boorstin said the “patriots more true followers of the British Constitution than the British were themselves”. He said that they colonists still recognized their British heritage and carried many British principles over into the new nation. Concluding the Neo- Conservative School also believed that the revolution was revolutionary.
World War II also brought the Intellectual School who held no group of historians but felt that the revolution was not revolutionary; it was solely about bringing the separation of the colonies from British Rule. Neo- Conservative historian Edmund S. Morgan disagreed and said that he believed the colonists were “derived from natural law” higher then the British Constitution and that the resistance was consequential from “ideological” roots and was something the colonists were devoted to.
Hence, the question “Was the American Revolution Revolutionary or Non-Revolutionary?”, brought upon two views one that is was based on the desire of independence from Britain and the other being the Revolution happened because of a “violent social upheaval”. These views stemmed out to five schools of though on the topic being the nationalist or patriotic, the imperial, the progressive the neo-conservative and the intellectual schools. Nationalist or patriotic, the imperial, and the neo-conservative believed the revolution was revolutionary although they had different reasons for believing so while the progressive and intellectual schools believed the revolution was un-revolutionary being for self interests of the upper class.

Guided Readings: Toward Revolution
by Steven Mintz
Reading 1
For fire and water are not more heterogeneous than the different colonies in North America. Nothing can exceed the jealousy and emulation which they possess in regard to each other. . . . In short . . . were they left to themselves there would soon be a civil war from one end of the continent to the other, while the Indians and Negroes would . . . impatiently watch the opportunity of exterminating them all together.
—Rev. Andrew Burnaby, 1760
Reading 2
The revolution was effected before the war commenced. The revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.
—John Adams, 1818
Reading 3
A colonist cannot make a button, a horseshoe, nor a hobnail, but some snootly ironmonger or respectable buttonmaker of England shall bawl and squall that his honor’s worship is most egregiously maltreated, injured, cheated, and robbed by the rascally American republicans.
— Boston Gazette, 1765
Reading 4
We have called this a burthensome tax, because the duties are so numerous and high . . . that it would be totally impossible for the people to subsist under it. . . . We further apprehend this tax to be unconstitutional. We have always understood it to be a grand and fundamental principle of the constitution, that no freeman should be subject to any tax to which he has not given his own consent, in person or by proxy. . . . We take it clearly, there fore, to be inconsistent with the spirit of the common law, and of the essential fundamental principle of the British constitution, that we should be represented in that assembly in any sense, unless it be by a fiction of law.
—Resolution of the Town of Braintree, Massachusetts, opposing the Stamp Act, 1765
Reading 5
If we view the whole of the conduct of the ministry and parliament, I do not see how any one can doubt but that there is a settled fix’d plan for enslaving the colonies, or bringing them under arbitrary government. . . . If the ministry can secure a majority in parliament they may rule . . . as absolutely as they do in France or Spain, yea as in Turkey or India. . . .
View now the situation of America: loaded with taxes from the British parliament, as heavy as she can possibly support under,—our lands charged with the most exorbitant quit rent,—these taxes collected by foreigners, steeled against any impressions from our groans or complaints . . . our charters taken away—our assemblies annihilated,—governors and councils, appointed by royal authority without any concurrence of the people, enacting such laws as their sovereign pleasure shall dictate . . . the lives and property of Americans entirely at the disposal of officers more than three thousand miles removed from any power to control them—armies of the soldiers quartered among the inhabitants, who know the horrid purpose for which they are stationed, in the colonies—to subjugate and beat down the inhabitants.
—Reverend Ebenezer Baldwin, 1774
Reading 6
Considering the utter impracticability of their ever being fully and equally represented in parliament, and the great expense that must unavoidably attend even a partial representation there, this House thinks that a taxation of their constituents, even without their consent, grievous as it is, would be preferable to any representation that could be admitted for them there.
—Circular letter, Massachusetts House of Representatives, 1768
Reading 7
The New Englanders by their canting, whinings, insinuating tricks have persuaded the rest of the Colonies that the Government is going to make absolute slaves of them.
—Nicholas Cresswell, a Tory, 1774
Reading 8
I have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath flourished under her former connection with Great Britain, that the same connection is necessary toward her future happiness, and will always have the same effect. Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument. . . .
Not one third of the inhabitants, even of this province [Pennsylvania] are of English descent. Wherefore I reprobate the phrase of parent or mother country applied to England only, as being false, selfish, narrow and ungenerous. . . .
The injuries and disadvantages we sustain by that connection are without number; and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourselves, instruct us to renounce the alliance: Because, any submission to, or dependence on Great Britain, tends directly to involve this continent in European wars and quarrels; and sets us at variance with nations, who would otherwise seek our friendship, and against whom, we have neither anger nor complaint. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no partial connection with any part of it. . . .
[Continued British rule will lead to] the ruin of the continent. And that for several reasons. First. The powers of governing still remaining in the hands of the king, he will have a negative over the whole legislation of this continent. And as he hath shown himself such an inveterate enemy to liberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power; is he, or is he not, a proper man to say to these colonies, "You shall make no laws but what I please" . . . Secondly. That as even the best terms, which we can expect to obtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of government by guardianship, which can last no longer than till the colonies come of age, so the general face and state of things, in the interim, will be unsettled and unpromising. . . .
O ye that love mankind! Yet that dare oppose, not only tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth! Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression.
—Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776

The Loyalists' Point of View  - Boston Massacre:  The Spark That Ignited The American RevolutionBy : Jacob Crouse and Jakob Lassiter
Peter Oliver And The Boston Massacre Trials
"I have a Quarto Volume of Evidence which I have pretty minutely taken. I have reviewed it, & it turns out to the dishonor of the Inhabitants, & appears quite plain to me that he must be acquitted, that the Person who gave the orders to fire was not the Capt. & indeed if it had been he, it is at present justifiable. What the Verdict will be, Monday I suppose will declare. I shall be glad to be released from this Prison,but it will be only an Exchange to Others. Farewell Dear Brother,
Yours Affectionately,
" To His Honour, Mr. Hutchinson, Milton.'' " PETER OLIVER.

From these search results, it seems that Lawrence Henry Gipson was part of the Imperial school of historians, which viewed the American Revolution as a conflict over constitutional and political issues rather than purely economic or social ones. Gipson, along with other Imperial school historians like George L. Beer and Charles M. Andrews, believed that the revolution was primarily about disagreements over governance and the extent of British authority over the colonies, rather than a fundamental shift in societal structures.

In contrast to the Progressive school, which saw the revolution as a struggle between social classes, the Imperial school maintained that the American Revolution was more about political principles and the desire for self-governance within the British Empire. Gipson's work, particularly his 15-volume history "The British Empire Before the American Revolution," likely reflects this perspective, emphasizing the imperial context and the complexities of British colonial administration.

Therefore, Gipson viewed the American Revolution as a political and constitutional crisis within the British Empire, rather than a social revolution or a radical break from existing norms. His work seems to portray the revolution as a conflict over the nature of imperial rule and the rights of the colonies within the empire, rather than a wholesale rejection of British institutions or society.
