So I've got this question: "Does selling your home affect Social Security?" Hmm, interesting. I don't recall much about Social Security rules, especially regarding homeownership or selling a home. I think Social Security is mainly based on your work history and the taxes you pay into the system. But maybe there are some assets or financial situations that can affect benefits. Let me think.

First off, I know that Social Security is a government program that provides benefits primarily to retired people, but also to disabled individuals and their dependents. The benefits are funded through payroll taxes, which employees and employers pay throughout their working lives.

Now, when it comes to selling a home, I suppose if someone sells their home and makes a significant profit, that might be considered income. But I'm not sure if that affects Social Security benefits directly. Maybe I need to look into how Social Security considers different types of income.

I recall that there are limits on earnings for Social Security beneficiaries, especially for those who are below their full retirement age. If you earn above a certain amount before your full retirement age, some of your Social Security benefits might be withheld. But selling a home—would that count as earnings?

Wait, selling a home is more like a capital gain, right? It's not really earned income like wages or salary. So perhaps it doesn't count towards the earnings limit that Social Security has.

But maybe there are other ways that selling a home could affect Social Security. For example, if someone has a lot of assets or a high net worth, does that disqualify them from receiving Social Security benefits? I don't think so. It seems like Social Security is a right earned through work history, regardless of your current wealth.

Another angle: maybe for Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which are needs-based programs, assets and income are considered. But Social Security is different; it's an entitlement program based on your work record.

Let me try to find some concrete information. Maybe I should look up "selling home and Social Security" or something like that.

Selling Your Home While Receiving SSI Benefits? - Silver & Silver
Selling Your Home While Receiving SSI Benefits? - January 30, 2019
Here at Silver & Silver, your Social Security Lawyers that serve clients in Montgomery County, PA, and the surrounding areas, we handle cases and consult clients about every imaginable aspect of Social Security law. In this article, we’d like to share a recent consultation that didn’t go the client’s way to shed light on the Do’s and Don’ts of selling your home while receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.
SSI is available to disabled adults and children who need income assistance or to citizens over the age of 65 with less than $2,000 in the bank, ($3000 if married).
Knowing how to manage additional income, such as the proceeds of selling a home, is crucial to maintaining SSI benefits.
We answered a letter in early January regarding this topic, from someone who sold a home and was later informed by Social Security that their SSI benefits were being discontinued. We researched the case and found that the seller did not comply with the proper procedure.
Here’s what you need to know if you receive SSI and want to sell your home:
After the sale, you have three months to buy a new home.
If, in that three month period, you buy a new house and have less than $2,000 in the bank, you will retain your SSI benefits.
If, in that three month period, you fail to buy a new house, the money you made off the sale (anything that bumps your bank account over $2,000/$3,000) will negate your SSI eligibility for each month that your assets exceed the amount permitted.
In order to reinstate your SSI benefits, it will be necessary for you to “spend down,” the funds in excess of $2000/$3000 which we covered in another recent blog post on our site, will be necessary until you have no more than $2,000. Social Security will require a record of what was purchased with the proceeds of your home.
You typically have 12 months in which to “Spend Down” funds and apply for reinstatement. Transferring money to a family member is not allowed. If you do not sufficiently allocate funds within those 12 months, you may have to start the SSI application process from scratch.
As you can see, complying with Social Security law can be a complicated task. It’s especially stressful if you’re handling a major life event, such as selling a home. It’s important to consult a legal team you can trust to help you dot all the ‘i’s’ and cross all the ‘t’s’.

Does selling a house affect Social Security benefits?
Asked by: Natnael Yera
asked in category: General Last Updated: 29th March, 2020
Does selling a house affect Social Security benefits?
Buying or selling a house would have no effect on Social Security disability benefits (SSDI). However, if you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI ), then proceeds from the sale of your home could potentially make you ineligible for SSI payments at least temporarily.
Click to see full answer.
Hereof,  do capital gains affect your Social Security benefits?
Capital gains could increase taxes on Social Security benefits. Your AGI plays a critical role in how much, if any, of your Social Security benefits will be taxed. If you have provisional income of $44,000 or less, less than 85% of your benefits will be taxed.
Beside above,  can you sell your house while on Medicaid? While you can sell your house for fair market value, it may make you ineligible for Medicaid and you may have to apply the proceeds of the sale to your nursing home bills. Except in certain circumstances, Medicaid may put a lien on your house for the amount of money spent on your care.
Correspondingly,  will selling my home affect my Medicare?
Selling may not affect premiums In some cases, selling your home may not affect your Medicare premiums at all. This is because tax laws often allow a large exclusion on the sale of your final home. And by final home, it is assumed that you will not be investing the proceeds from the sale into another house.
What affects Social Security benefits?
Your Social Security benefits will be based on the income you earned during your working years. Only your 35 highest-earning years will be counted. If you take Social Security before full retirement age, your benefits will permanently reduced.

SSI; profits from selling home to buy a new home
With a child receiving SSI, if we sell the house we live in and then any excess money (other than money going towards what we already owe on my current home loan) but all profit/excess money from the sell is being used directly towards the new down/loan for buying a new home/new residence,  will anything happen to my childs benefits/payments? what do we need to do to get this transaction/sell of one property for another okayed with SSI?  and what is the time limit we will have to sell our house once the sell of our home and buying of a new home transfers the sell profit funds towards the new home loan, then we move into the new home to be then counted as an excluded resource?....
I found the below excerpt on the SSI website that shows this situation in the underlined sections, but im not sure I fully understand the time limits for sure adn what to do, I want to make sure I do everything right.
Section from SSI site about excluded home when selling;
Social security Exclusion of the Home;
(a) Defined. A home is any property in which an individual (and spouse, if any) has an ownership interest and which serves as the individual&#039;s principal place of residence. This property includes the shelter in which an individual resides, the land on which the shelter is located and related outbuildings.
(b) Home not counted. We do not count a home regardless of its value. However, see §§ 416.1220 through 416.1224 when there is an income-producing property located on the home property that does not qualify under the home exclusion.
(c) If an individual changes principal place of residence. If an individual (and spouse, if any) moves out of his or her home without the intent to return, the home becomes a countable resource because it is no longer the individual&#039;s principal place of residence. If an individual leaves his or her home to live in an institution, we still consider the home to be the individual&#039;s principal place of residence, irrespective of the individual&#039;s intent to return, as long as a spouse or dependent relative of the eligible individual continues to live there. The individual&#039;s equity in the former home becomes a countable resource effective with the first day of the month following the month it is no longer his or her principal place of residence.
(e) Proceeds from the sale of an excluded home. (1) The proceeds from the sale of a home which is excluded from the individual&#039;s resources will also be excluded from resources to the extent they are intended to be used and are, in fact, used to purchase another home, which is similarly excluded, within 3 months of the date of receipt of the proceeds.
(2) The value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract constitutes a “proceed” which can be excluded from resources if—
(i) The note results from the sale of an individual&#039;s home as described in § 416.1212(a);
(ii) Within 3 months of receipt (execution) of the note, the individual purchases a replacement home as described in § 416.1212(a) (see paragraph (f) of this section for an exception); and
(iii) All note-generated proceeds are reinvested in the replacement home within 3 months of receipt (see paragraph (g) of this section for an exception).
(3) In addition to excluding the value of the note itself, other proceeds from the sale of the former home are excluded resources if they are used within 3 months of receipt to make payment on the replacement home. Such proceeds, which consist of the downpayment and that portion of any installment amount constituting payment against the principal, represent a conversion of a resource.
(f) Failure to purchase another excluded home timely. If the individual does not purchase a replacement home within the 3-month period specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the value of a promissory note or similar installment sales contract received from the sale of an excluded home is a countable resource effective with the first moment of the month following the month the note is executed. If the individual purchases a replacement home after the expiration of the 3-month period, the note becomes an excluded resource the month following the month of purchase of the replacement home provided that all other proceeds are fully and timely reinvested as explained in paragraph (g) of this section.
(g) Failure to reinvest proceeds timely. (1) If the proceeds (e.g., installment amounts constituting payment against the principal) from the sale of an excluded home under a promissory note or similar installment sales contract are not reinvested fully and timely (within 3 months of receipt) in a replacement home, as of the first moment of the month following receipt of the payment, the individual&#039;s countable resources will include:
(i) The value of the note; and
(ii) That portion of the proceeds, retained by the individual, which was not timely reinvested
(2) The note remains a countable resource until the first moment of the month following the receipt of proceeds that are fully and timely reinvested in the replacement home. Failure to reinvest proceeds for a period of time does not permanently preclude exclusion of the promissory note or installment sales contract. However, previously received proceeds that were not timely reinvested remain countable resources to the extent they are retained.

Will I lose Social Security benefits if I sell my house?
Making Sen$e May 15, 2019 6:46 PM EDT
Journalist Philip Moeller answers your questions about health, aging, and retirement. Phil is the author of the book, “Get What’s Yours for Medicare,” and co-author of “Get What’s Yours: The Revised Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security.” Send your questions to Phil.
Tina – Wisconsin: I am 64 and receive a Social Security survivor benefit. However, it is so small that I also qualify for SSI (Supplemental Security Income) and get help from Medicaid in paying for some very expensive medications that I must take. I am considering selling my country home to move into town but am scared that the money I receive from the sale will cause me to lose my current insurance support help.
Phil Moeller: You will not lose your coverage. However, your income may increase enough to make you no longer eligible for Medicaid and SSI. Should this happen, you would have to pay for these benefits through regular Medicare and would also lose your Extra Help supports.
If your income and assets (as defined in terms of Medicaid eligibility) later declined, you could once again be eligible for your current benefits. The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) provides free Medicare counseling and should have an office in your state staffed by someone who can help you.
Charles – Virginia: I am attempting to help a person in need who has aged parents (65+), who are moving toward dementia, and a son (30+ years of age) who had a stroke and is paralyzed. She works at a nail salon and makes a poverty-level wage. What is the best place, in your view, to get information on how I can help her (straight talk) and to learn the ins-and-outs of how all of this works? She is becoming desperate and is struggling to keep her wits about her.
Phil Moeller: As you’ve clearly ascertained, she is in a very tough spot, and you are on the side of the angels in trying to help her.
I’d start with a Virginia office of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP). This national program provides free Medicare counseling and should be able to explain some of the options.
The State Health Insurance Assistance Program provides free Medicare counseling.
If her parents are of modest means, it’s possible they could qualify for Medicaid, which does pay for long-term care services in both the home and in nursing facilities. Medicare does not support such care, and it’s very expensive to afford on one’s own.
In terms of her son, if he’s considered disabled by Social Security, he would also be eligible for Medicare/Medicaid. If he became disabled prior to age 22, he also would be eligible for lifelong Social Security benefits on one of his parent’s work records (assuming he’s not already receiving them).
Let me know how things go and if she has further questions.
Ardyce – New York: My husband is 67 years old and is covered as a dependent under my active employee medical insurance plan. He has been out of work and is now considering taking his Social Security benefit. He already has Medicare A, and I know that he does not need to enroll in Medicare B since he has my active employee benefit insurance coverage. However, is he required to get Medicare D for prescription medications when he files for Social Security?  I don’t have drug coverage with my employee insurance at this time but can enroll for 2020 during my next open enrollment period.
Phil Moeller: There is no connection between Social Security and Part D, only Part A.
However, because he is eligible for Medicare (by virtue of being 65) his ability to stay on your employer drug plan hinges on that plan’s coverage being credible — i.e., at least as good as a typical Medicare Part D plan. Most employer plans are meet that requirement, and your employer’s plan is required under Medicare rules to certify each year that its drug coverage is credible.
If, for some reason (related mostly to high-deductible plans), your plan’s drug coverage is not credible, then your husband would have to get a Part D plan. In this event, he would NOT need to first get Part B but is eligible for D simply on the basis of having Part A.
Yes, Medicare is way too complicated!
Deb – Florida: Five years ago, we sold our home to our son and began full-time RV-ing. We have been using our old address for mail and voting purposes and spend winters in the South Florida area. We plan to begin using a mail forwarding service in northern Florida beginning next month and will change our mailing address with Medicare. My husband is already on Medicare. I will be applying for Medicare in a few months. I plan to continue using my current doctors in South Florida. Will this be a problem or cause Medicare to void my coverage since my premium would be based on a northern Florida zip code, and I would be using my Medicare coverage predominantly in southern Florida?
Phil Moeller: Medicare is not going to void your coverage. Parts A and B of Medicare cover you anywhere in the U.S. However, private Medicare insurers — Part D drug plans, Medicare Advantage plans, and possibly even Medigap supplement plans — might have issues with you living in a different part of the state. If you plan to apply for any private Medicare insurance plans, you should contact the plan ahead of time and find out how best to proceed.
Medicare rules for ex-pats
Sue and Hank: My wife and I, 72 and 74 respectively, have had Medicare Parts A, B, and D for a number of years but have been living in a foreign country, where we have been granted dual citizenship and have joined the national health insurance program. It is less expensive than U.S. Medicare and helps manage our health and medical needs here. We have maintained our Medicare coverage for use whenever we return to U.S. We are planning to return to the U.S permanently in two years. Is it possible, as well as wise, for us to cancel our Medicare now to save some money, and then reenter the program when we return to the U.S.?
Phil Moeller: If you cancel Medicare and re-enroll in two years, you would pay lifetime late-enrollment penalties. They will equal 10 percent of your Part B premiums for each year you are late, and 1 percent of the national average Part D premium (now about $35 a month) for each month you are late.
If you cancel Medicare and reenroll in two years, you would pay lifetime late-enrollment penalties.
With Part B premiums now about $135 a month for each of you, a two-year penalty would add about $54 a month to your total premiums for the rest of your life. If you dropped B, you’d save about $6,500, so it would take about 10 years for those savings to be exceeded by your cumulative penalties.
Aramais: I am 71 years old and still working while receiving my Social Security benefits. I will be retiring early next year and then moving to the Philippines. From what I have heard, Medicare is mandatory in the U.S., but I have no idea what will happen when I move.
Phil Moeller: Medicare will not provide primary health insurance outside the U.S. You will need to look into what’s available in the Philippines. If you keep your Medicare, it will only cover you for care you receive inside the U.S.

How to Sell My House While on Social Security Disability | Sapling
How to Sell My House While on Social Security Disability
By Melly Parker
Selling your home while you're on SSDI doesn't have to be difficult.
When you're on Social Security Disability, it can seem difficult to do normal, every day tasks. Taking on a large, stressful task like selling your home can be physically difficult and may require additional help. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take not only to sell your home without hurting yourself, but to ensure you get the best price possible. If you have good friends and family nearby, you may be able to draw upon them and avoid hiring additional professional help, but you should expect to hire some outside labor for some of the more specialized parts of the home-selling process.
Advertisement
Step 1
Discuss the sale of your home with your benefits counselor before you make any permanent moves toward selling. Selling your home shouldn't interfere with your benefits, which are based on earned income and disability, but you should notify your counselor so he is aware of the situation and can help you plan how best to use your benefits during the sale. There is also a cap on the assets you can have if you're receiving SSDI, so be sure to discuss that cap and the resulting money you will receive from the sale with your benefits counselor, too.

Step 2
Ask friends or hire local people to assist you in fixing up the house. Homes sell better when they're clean and well-repaired and, if you're on Social Security Disability, you may have a difficult time performing those repairs on your own. .
Step 3
Hire a moving company to remove clutter from your home and to a different location or storage unit. Clutter-free homes with minimal possessions are more attractive to prospective buyers. A good moving company can even help you pack the items if you're having trouble doing it on your own.

Step 4
Hire an appraiser if you aren't sure what your home is worth. An appraiser will examine your house and give you an idea of what price you should be expecting.
Step 5
Have your home inspected and make the inspection report available to prospective buyers. The report can instill confidence in them, especially if they think that you haven't been able to maintain the home while on Social Security Disability.
Advertisement
Step 6
Put a sign in your front yard--if you can, depending on your homeowner's association--advertising that your home is for sale. If you aren't in a rush, wait a month and see if you have any offers that match what you hope to gain.
Step 7
Hire a realtor if you're having trouble generating interest in the house. A realtor should be able to sell your home without you having to be overly physically active, which is important when you are unable to work.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got these search results. Let's see what they say.

First document is from Silver & Silver, a law firm, talking about selling a home while receiving SSI benefits. So, SSI is Supplemental Security Income, which is different from Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or just regular Social Security benefits. SSI is needs-based, meaning it considers your income and assets, whereas SSDI is based on your work history and contributions to Social Security.

So, the question is about Social Security benefits, which could include SSDI or retirement benefits. But this article is specifically about SSI, which might not directly answer the question. Still, it's good to know that for SSI, selling a home can affect benefits unless you buy a new one within three months and keep your assets below a certain limit.

Second document is from askinglot.com, and it says that selling a house wouldn't affect Social Security disability benefits (SSDI), but it could affect SSI benefits. So, again, it distinguishes between SSDI and SSI.

Third document is from Disability Benefits Help, and it seems to be discussing SSI and how selling a home affects it, similar to the first document.

Fourth document is from PBS NewsHour, and it has a question about losing Social Security benefits if selling a house. The answer says you won't lose coverage, but your income might increase enough to make you ineligible for Medicaid and SSI. So, again, it's talking about SSI and Medicaid, not necessarily regular Social Security benefits.

Fifth document is from Sapling.com, titled "How to Sell My House While on Social Security Disability." It seems to be giving general advice on selling a house while on SSDI, again distinguishing between SSDI and SSI.

From these searches, it seems like selling a home doesn't directly affect Social Security benefits like SSDI or retirement benefits. However, it might affect supplementary programs like SSI and Medicaid, which are needs-based.

Let me think about this. Social Security benefits, especially SSDI or retirement benefits, are based on your work history and the taxes you've paid into the system. They aren't typically affected by your assets or capital gains from selling a home.

But, if someone is receiving SSI, which is needs-based, then their assets and income are considered. So, selling a home could increase their assets temporarily, potentially making them ineligible for SSI unless they reinvest the proceeds into a new home within three months.

Also, regarding Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income individuals, including those with disabilities, selling a home could affect eligibility if the proceeds are not used appropriately.

So, to directly answer the question: Does selling your home affect Social Security? Generally, no, not for SSDI or retirement benefits. However, it could affect supplementary programs like SSI and Medicaid if you're receiving those.

But to be thorough, I should check if there are any specific rules regarding capital gains from selling a home affecting Social Security benefits.

Looking back at the second document from askinglot.com, it mentions that capital gains could increase taxes on Social Security benefits. So, that's an indirect effect.

Let me recall how Social Security benefits are taxed. If your combined income is above certain levels, a portion of your Social Security benefits becomes taxable. Combined income is your adjusted gross income plus nontaxable interest plus half of your Social Security benefits.

So, if you sell your home and have a significant capital gain, that could increase your adjusted gross income, which in turn could make more of your Social Security benefits taxable.

But, if you reinvest the proceeds from selling your home into a new home, especially if it's your primary residence, you might be able to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) of capital gains from taxation. So, in that case, the capital gain might not be taxable, and thus wouldn't affect your Social Security benefits.

Alternatively, if you don't qualify for the exclusion or if the gain is larger than the exclusion, you might have to pay capital gains tax on the profit, which could increase your AGI and make more of your Social Security benefits taxable.

So, in summary:

1. Selling your home generally doesn't affect your Social Security benefits in terms of the benefit amount you receive.

2. However, if selling your home results in a significant capital gain that increases your adjusted gross income, it could make more of your Social Security benefits subject to income tax.

3. If you're receiving SSI or Medicaid, selling your home could affect your eligibility for those programs unless you reinvest the proceeds into a new home within a specified time frame.

Therefore, for most people receiving Social Security benefits, selling their home won't directly affect their benefits. But there could be tax implications to consider.

I think that covers the main points. If someone is concerned about this, they should consult the Social Security Administration or a financial advisor for personalized advice.
