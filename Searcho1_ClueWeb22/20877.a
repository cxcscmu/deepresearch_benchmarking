Alright, so I need to figure out what has caused recent inflation. Inflation is when the general prices of goods and services rise over time, which means each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; in other words, the purchasing power of money decreases. It's a big deal because it affects everyone’s wallet and the overall economy.

First, I should probably understand what inflation is and how it's measured. The most common way to measure inflation is through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which looks at the average change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services that households typically purchase. There are other measures like the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the GDP deflator, but CPI is the one most people refer to when talking about inflation.

Now, to find out what's causing recent inflation, I need to look at factors that lead to price increases across the economy. There are a few key causes of inflation:

1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: This happens when there's too much demand for goods and services compared to the supply. Essentially, too much money chasing too few goods drives up prices.

2. **Cost-Push Inflation**: This occurs when the costs of producing goods and services increase, such as higher raw material costs or higher wages, which then gets passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

3. **Built-In Inflation**: This is when inflation expectations become self-fulfilling. For example, if workers expect prices to rise, they may demand higher wages, which then lead to higher production costs and further price increases.

4. **Monetary Inflation**: This can happen when a central bank increases the money supply too rapidly, leading to more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, thus driving up prices.

Given that, I need to see which of these factors have been at play recently. "Recently" could refer to different time periods, but I think the user might be referring to the period starting around 2021, when many economies started seeing higher inflation rates than usual.

Let me consider the global context. After the 2008 financial crisis, many central banks around the world adopted expansionary monetary policies, including quantitative easing, to stimulate their economies. This involved buying government bonds and other securities, which increased the money supply. So, monetary inflation could be a factor.

Additionally, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, there were massive economic disruptions. Lockdowns and supply chain issues led to shortages of certain goods, which could have contributed to demand-pull inflation.

Also, the pandemic led to significant government spending on stimulus packages to support households and businesses, which could have increased demand beyond what the economy could supply, again leading to demand-pull inflation.

On the cost-push side, there have been increases in energy prices, particularly oil and gas, due to various factors including geopolitical tensions and increased demand as economies reopened. Higher energy costs can increase the cost of production for many goods and services, leading to cost-push inflation.

Furthermore, logistics and transportation costs have risen due to supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages. For example, there have been reports of container shortages and port congestion, which have driven up shipping costs.

Wages have also been increasing in some sectors, especially where there are labor shortages. If higher wages lead to higher production costs, businesses might pass those costs onto consumers through higher prices.

It's also worth considering inflation expectations. If people and businesses expect inflation to stay high, they might make decisions that reinforce that expectation, leading to built-in inflation.

Moreover, there are global factors at play. For instance, China's economic policies and its role as a major manufacturer can affect global supply chains and commodity prices.

I should also think about specific sectors where inflation has been particularly pronounced. For example, housing, used cars, and food have seen notable price increases in some countries recently.

Wait a minute, maybe I should look at some data to see which sectors have been driving inflation recently. Perhaps looking at the CPI breakdown by category would be helpful.

Let me try to find some recent CPI data. I think I can look for data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US or similar organizations in other countries.

Actually, since the question doesn't specify a particular country, I should consider whether inflation causes are universal or vary by country.

But for simplicity, maybe I can focus on the US, as it's a major economy and its inflation trends often have global implications.

So, let's say I look at US inflation data from, say, 2021 to 2022. I recall that during that period, inflation in the US reached its highest levels in decades.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2022, the CPI was up by around 8.6% compared to a year earlier. That's a significant increase.

Now, what were the main contributors to that inflation?

From what I've read, some of the biggest drivers were energy prices, used cars and trucks, shelter, and food.

For example, energy prices saw a substantial increase due to rising oil and gasoline prices, partly influenced by the recovery in demand after the pandemic and geopolitical events like the conflict in Ukraine.

Used car and truck prices also surged because of supply chain issues in the automotive industry, particularly shortages of semiconductor chips, which reduced the supply of new cars and increased demand for used ones.

Shelter costs, which include rent and owners' equivalent rent, also contributed significantly to inflation. Housing markets have been tight, with low inventory and high demand driving up rents and home prices.

Food prices have also been increasing, partly due to higher transportation costs, input costs like fertilizer, and sometimes supply chain disruptions.

So, in the US context, it seems that a combination of demand-pull and cost-push factors are at play.

On the demand side, stimulus measures and pent-up demand from the pandemic have boosted consumer spending, while on the supply side, supply chain disruptions, higher input costs, and labor shortages have increased production costs.

Moreover, the significant increase in money supply due to the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy might have also contributed to inflation.

But is this picture similar in other countries, or is it specific to the US?

I think it's worthwhile to consider a global perspective. Maybe I should look at inflation rates in other major economies to see if they're experiencing similar trends.

For instance, in the Eurozone, the UK, Japan, and China, what have their inflation rates been like recently?

I recall that many countries have seen elevated inflation rates in recent years, so perhaps there are common global factors at play.

Global factors could include:

- Increased demand as economies recover from the pandemic.

- Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic and logistical challenges.

- Geopolitical events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, which has affected energy and grain prices.

- Rising commodity prices, including metals and agricultural products.

- Central banks' accommodative monetary policies, which have increased liquidity in the global financial system.

So, it seems that both domestic and global factors are contributing to recent inflation.

But to get a more precise answer, maybe I should look for analyses or reports from economic institutions or experts who have studied this topic.

Perhaps I can look for articles from reputable sources like the IMF, World Bank, or major news outlets that have reported on the causes of recent inflation.

Alternatively, academic studies or research papers might provide deeper insights into the underlying causes.

Wait, maybe I can search for something like "what caused recent inflation" or "factors behind rising inflation in 2021-2022."

I think performing a web search would be helpful here to gather more information and verify my thoughts.

So, I'll do that.

There are a number of factors at play.
For the last 25 years, inflation has been below 3%, but in May, it broke the 3% barrier to hit 3.8% for the month. Investors are wondering, what's causing the inflation and why now? On a Fool Live episode recorded on May 26, Fool contributors Matthew Frankel, Brian Feroldi, and Brian Withers discuss what's going on with inflation and how it's impacting consumers.
What's Causing All This Inflation?
Watch on
Matt Frankel: What's causing all this inflation? Obviously the Fed's loose monetary policy is a big factor. But one of the whole goals of the Fed lowering interest rates is to boost inflation. That's why they were trying to get to 2% for the past decade unsuccessfully. But that's why they've kept rates relatively low.
The amount of stimulus that's been injected into the economy, not just the stimulus checks which everyone likes to point fingers at, the enhanced unemployment benefits, the child credit, tax credit that's about to really start rolling out this year. The PPP has really helped stimulate some businesses that needed it. A lot of stimulus has been injected and it's continuing to be injected over the past year or so. Tax breaks, things like that are also forms of economic stimulus we're seeing. Supply chain disruptions. Have either of you driven by a new car dealership recently?
Brian Feroldi: I have but I haven't really paid attention. Should I have been paying attention?
Frankel: Yes. My local Nissan dealership normally has about 300 cars on its lot. You know how many it has right now? Seven.
Brian Withers: Woah. [laughs] That's amazing.
Feroldi: Is that the chip shortage, primarily?
Frankel: It's the chip shortage and is just general supply disruptions. Most automakers stopped making cars during COVID, so they're still trying to catch up, regardless of the chip shortage.
Here's a cool statistic that I found out. My Ford SUV that I bought two years ago is worth more now as a used car than I paid for it new.
Withers: Wow.
Frankel: My Blue Book value is about $1,000 more than I paid for it. Now have 30,000 miles on the thing. I could sell my car and make a profit if I wanted to.
Withers: But it's the same thing with your house. The chances of finding a new car at a decent price. [laughs]
Frankel: Then I have to buy another inflated car.
Withers: Right. If you're buying a bike, well, shoot, you can't even buy a bike anymore. Those are sold out, too.
Frankel: Yeah. I've walked into many restaurants like I walked into Chipotle, there's a big sign, that says, "Due to supply chain disruptions, we're out of a few things." That's just one example. You'll see the signs in a lot of retailers all over the country right now. Supply chain disruptions are leading to a big supply and demand imbalance in a lot of industries.
Then wage pressure is the last one I'll mention. There's an employment shortage in a lot of places. I don't know if your local restaurants have shut down on Mondays because of lack of staff. It's a good thing, don't get me wrong. It's causing the industries toward the bottom of the pay spectrum to really take a hard look at how much they're paying their employees.
There's wage pressure which gets passed on to consumers. Chipotle, I just mentioned, recently announced they're raising prices by about 5% to combat higher wage pressure. That's one thing that leads to inflation. If it costs people more to have a staff, they're going to make their products cost more. Let's get into some stocks. We've rambled on for about 10 minutes unless you had other thoughts about inflation you wanted to share.
Withers: No, I think that was a great overview. Thanks Matt.

Inflation is heating up, and it's not just because of the Federal Reserve.
Recent data shows inflation is as high as it's been in nearly three decades, and many experts attribute it to the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy. But that's not the only reason we're seeing such elevated inflation numbers. In this Fool Live clip, recorded on June 21, Fool.com contributor and certified financial planner Matt Frankel discusses his top five reasons for the higher inflation with Industry Focus host Jason Moser.
5 Reasons Inflation Is Rising in Summer 2021
Watch on
Matt Frankel: Why are we seeing all this inflation? I can narrow it down to five reasons if we can go into those.
Jason Moser: Absolutely, let's do it.
Frankel: Everyone blames it on the Fed. That's reason No. 1 out of five. The Fed has the mandate to control inflation. That's one of the reasons we have the Fed, or at least the policy-making arm, the FOMC. The Fed's monetary policy is very loose and guide even more so after the COVID pandemic hit. They're doing their quantitative easing, which means they're buying bonds at a rate of a $120 billion a month to inject more capital into the system. Interest rates are at near zero levels. We had just really been in the middle of a rate-hike increase from rate-hike cycle when COVID hit and now we're back to zero. When money is cheap and they are just injecting liquidity into the system that is going to produce some inflationary pressure. That's not the only reason we're seeing inflation, so that's one. No. 2 is all the stimulus we've been seeing. This is separate from the Fed. All the CARES Act with the stimulus checks, we've had three rounds of stimulus checks now. People are about to start getting monthly checks for an increased child tax credit. The second half of the year, we had the PPP, which injected billions of dollars into the system. A lot of stimulus creating a lot of inflationary pressure. That's another thing that I'd have to call that No. 2 that people blame this on. Everyone is going out and spending their stimulus checks they're just thinking about this inflation. Jason didn't take his family to the stables and I didn't take my family to Disney World a month ago because we got stimulus checks, it's because we wanted to get out. That really brings me to No. 3, demand. Inflation is really supply-and-demand-driven when you get outside of the policy sphere. Too many people want something and there isn't enough of it, the price is going to go up.
Moser: Of course.
Frankel: If anyone has tried to book a plane ticket or a hotel in the past month or two, it got a whole lot more expensive. The reason is supply and demand. Demand has just gone through the roof lately. In a lot of ways, the reopening is tougher on the economy than shutting down because of the big spike in demand.
Moser: I'm glad you said that because I know that probably grinds someone's gears but there is some truth to that. You are right there in that when you have all of this money chasing a somewhat limited amount of goods, the impact is obvious. Now I guess then the question is, we hear this word transitory mentioned and we'll get into that. But it does make you wonder, is this something that's lasting or is it something that is just a temporary blip?
Frankel: Right. A lot of it depends on the Fed that's I guess, the most control you could have out of any of these factors.
Moser: Right.
Frankel: You can't tell people to stop taking vacations. You can't tell people to stop going to the store. But the Fed can adjust monetary policy to control inflation.
Moser: Certainly.
Frankel: Those are three. Going further, the supply chain disruptions. That's another temporary one like the transitory factors you're just mentioning. I don't know. Have you driven by any new car dealerships in the past few months?
Moser: Not where I've paid any attention, no.
Frankel: Next time you do pay attention, the big Nissan dealership near my house normally has 300 or so new cars on the lot. You know how many they have right now?
Moser: No, I don't.
Frankel: Seven.
Moser: Really, I was going to say 50 I had been way off even with that.
Frankel: The Chevy dealership near me normally has a few hundred cars. They have some trucks. Do you know how many actual cars they have like sedans? Zero.
Moser: Wow.
Frankel: There is not one new Chevy car in the Columbia, South Carolina, dealership.
Moser: Holy cow.
Frankel: That's a big supply chain disruption. That's led to used car values, which are part of inflation, really spiking. My Ford SUV that I bought two years ago is worth more now than I paid for it new.
Moser: That's just insane to even think about.
Frankel: I would go sell it to the dealership but then I have to buy another inflated car so it's a paper gain.
Moser: It's the same thing with the inflated home value. You can sell your house for twice what you bought it, that sounds great but then I got to go buy another house. Unless you know that you're going to be moving somewhere where it's just substantially lower cost of living, listen, that's a lot of work for probably not a lot of gain.
Frankel: There is a lot of supply chain disruptions going on in food service right now. You can't get chicken wings in a lot of places. That's a big supply chain thing.
Moser: It's the chicken wars.
Frankel: We went out to dinner for Father's Day with my wife wanted wings, they didn't have any and it wasn't because it was Sunday and they ran out. It was a supply chain thing. My Costco was out of wings. When I walked into Chipotle, there was a big sign that said, "Due to supply chain limitations, we're out of several items. Apologies for the inconvenience." That is driving a prices in a lot of cases. Not just the cars, that's just a really visible example, most people don't notice, but if you drive by a new car dealership, you'll see a lot of empty parking lot these days. The high-end models are going crazy, too. The Range Rover dealership near me it's right on the interstate so you can see right into it. Empty showroom there's three spots for cars. There's not one in the showroom. Not one.
Moser: That amazing.
Frankel: That's four. And No. 5, I'd say probably the more controversial of the five is wage pressure. Right now, you've probably heard there's a worker shortage. American Airlines have been canceling flights for this very reason.
Moser: I have heard.
Frankel: That's very real. The question is what's causing it.
Moser: Yeah.
Frankel: Everyone blames it on the unemployment benefit boost. But whatever the reason is, the companies especially in the food service and retail industries are really having to raise wages to compete and to get employees. I know a restaurant owner here they had to close Mondays and Tuesdays because they didn't have enough staff. He said he raised their starting wage by $3 an hour and now he has too many applications.
Moser: Well, this is supply and demand, it's economics at work. At least we know that the world hadn't gone completely crazy.
Frankel: That $3 an hour he raised it, who's going to pay for that?
Moser: Oh, yeah. I know what you mean. Someone has got to pay for it.
Frankel: Whatever the cause, there's a bunch of cause. It's not just the unemployment. A lot of parents don't have a child care and can't work right now. A lot of day cares haven't reopened since the pandemic in some places. Or they're just getting ramped back up. There is a bunch of reasons why. But the fact of the matter is companies are raising wages. Chipotle I mentioned already they just announced they're raising their prices by 5% in order to raise wages to be more competitive and get staff. There's an hour wait for burritos at the Chipotle by me because they don't have staff.
Moser: Man.
Frankel: I didn't wait there, I left. I left and just went home and ate. The wage pressure is very real and that is always passed onto the consumer. Companies cannot just take a hit to their profit margin that always rests on to the consumer.
Moser: No. But by the same token, you do see one thing to look for and it is nice to see companies that do take that longer view and maybe don't necessarily view putting it all on the consumer. Maybe stepping back a little bit and realizing that, hey, they've got a good thing going and even if we take a little bit of short-term pain in this price increase it can still ultimately work out in favor in the long run.

What's causing inflation right now?
It's not just soaring energy prices that are to blame.

Rising commodity prices, higher trading costs and supply chain disruptions are all adding to inflationary pressures.
Surging commodity prices earlier this year led to renewed talk of another commodity super-cycle, similar to the one that occurred in the early 2000s. Back then, it was largely driven by China’s economic boom. As the heat map below shows, precious metal prices surged at the beginning of this year. While the boom has started to cool, a strong global economic recovery will keep prices elevated.

Historically, there is a relatively strong inverse correlation between real interest rates and the price of gold, which is unsurprising since a lower discount rate increases the fundamental value of financial assets. However, that correlation reversed recently. Record high CPI inflation figures have lowered the real interest rate to minus 4%, while the gold price has fallen – a sign that gold is not always a great inflation hedge.

Copper prices rose on the back of renewed demand as the global economy recovery continues.
Copper is strongly correlated with global industrial production and output because of its widespread use in industrial production. However, falling copper later this year could be an early indicator that the global recovery might get derailed again by the coronavirus.

We also saw a spectacular surge in lumber prices this summer due to temporary supply side shortages, which affected the US construction industry. After the price almost tripled within a couple of months, it has now fallen again by over 70%.
This is a common dynamic in commodity markets: a temporary shortage leads to higher prices. This will then lead to a large increase in supply as production ramps up. As a result, suppliers subsequently sit on excess inventories, pushing the price back down again – a phenomenon known as the bullwhip effect.
As this chart shows, the real price of lumber (deflated by the US CPI) shows signs of mean-reversion and is now just slightly above its long-run average.

With climate change intensifying, we can expect extreme weather events to occur more frequently. This is causing disruptions in agricultural production worldwide and leading to higher prices for agricultural and food commodities in general. New research suggests that advanced economies may suffer as much as, or even more than developing countries from rising food prices.

Oil prices are now exceeding USD80 per barrel for the first time since 2014.
As US shale became the world’s margin producer, oil prices were range-bound between USD40and USD70. When oil prices rise too much, US capacity goes up and the number of rig counts increases. Higher supply then puts downward pressure on prices.
Meanwhile, when prices fall too much, some US producers suspend operations, as they did in2020, simply because shale production is only profitable at a price of USD45 to USD65 per barrel.

‍
Now both oil and natural gas prices are surging, leading to renewed talks of a 1970s-style energy crisis, as we can see from spot prices below. The UK is particularly affected because the truck driver shortage is also causing additional supply chain disruptions.

‍
Just as concerning is the continued supply-side disruptions resulting from the global pandemic, such as a major Chinese port shutting down due to a zero-Covid policy.
Shipping indices have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the year. These higher trading costs will translate into higher prices for goods.  The shipping industry took a big hit during Corona when a large part of the world went into lockdown. With a now booming global economy, the shipping industry is suddenly facing rapidly accelerating demand while capacity is constrained, which is leading to surging freight rates.

‍
The Baltic Dry, a shipping index for dry bulk transport vessels, has also soared higher than at any point since the global financial crisis. The capsize index, which is tracking coal and iron ore cargos, has hit its highest level in 13 years. This is to show that the global economy is facing ongoing shipping constraints across the board as the global recovery accelerates.

‍
Finally, the IHS PMI suppliers’ delivery time index shows that the pandemic has caused some supply-side disruptions across industries, with delivery times increasing across all major economies.
The US, in particularly, is facing rapidly rising demand combined with supply-side constraints, which should lead to temporary inflationary pressures.
Macrobond users, access the chart here
‍
There are three factors that have led to the recent surge in inflation.
First, while the commodity price boom has stalled when it comes to metals, rising commodity food prices and energy prices continue unabated, and have been one of the main contributors to eurozone inflation in recent months.
Second, shipping costs are surging.
And third, supply chain disruptions continue to affect all major economies with rapidly worsening delivery times. While these are all temporary factors, they will contribute to inflation in the coming quarters.

What Are the Main Causes of Inflation? Current Causes of Inflation
You may have heard that in November 2021, inflation reached the highest rate in 30 years, but what does that mean, and how does it impact you? Let’s start with the basics.
Inflation is an economic phenomenon where the value of goods and services in an economy increases over time. Have you ever heard someone talking about how, back in the ’60s, you could get a Coke for a nickel? The reason why a soda now costs $2 is because of inflation—the relative value of money has gone down compared to the price of goods.
In general, there are two main types of inflation that economists care about. In this post, we’ll explain those two causes, explain factors that influence inflation, explore ways experts suggest we counteract inflation, and what you can do about it. But first, we’ll dive into the current causes of inflation and how they’re impacting your current buying power.
4 Main Causes of Inflation in Our Current Economy
In the last few months, you may have noticed that prices have been rising on everything from grocery items to gas, with consumer prices up 6.8% compared to this time last year. That’s the power of inflation. But what’s currently causing inflation and this undesirable strain on your wallet?
With respect to the current economy, there are a few causes of inflation:
1.Increase in the Money Supply:
An increase in the money supply is meant to help stimulate the economy by helping to put more money in the hands of consumers. While this might sound like a positive shift, it can actually have negative influences on the economy, like contributing to inflation.
The Federal Reserve has printed trillions of dollars over the last two years, which has contributed to the devaluation of U.S. currency and the high inflation rate we’re currently experiencing—and is being speculated to continue.
Not only that, but the money supply has increased faster than the rate of production, which contributes to shortages. And, with more money in circulation, consumers have more to spend—which in turn is spurring greater consumer demand.
However, with demand outpacing production, there are many shortages across the country.
2.Supply Chain Disruption:
Whether you’re in the grocery store or waiting for something to ship from overseas, you’ve likely been having a hard time getting ahold of certain goods in recent months. There are a few factors that are playing into this current issue.
First, during the height of the pandemic, many companies decreased output because consumers weren’t spending. However, they are now and companies have been trying to play catch up.
Pair that with the shortages in an all-around shortage of supplies to make certain goods, and it’s become a compounding issue.
And we haven’t even gotten to the traffic jams at the various ports throughout the country that have led to a massive amount of goods being stuck for long periods of time, sometimes months. With goods stuck at these ports and unable to be unloaded, it means that many shelves will continue to sit empty.
3.overnment-Sponsored Unemployment:
In response to the spike in job losses we saw in 2020, there were increases and expansions to existing unemployment programs both on the state and federal level. While this may have helped get many people back on their feet, with many people unwilling to go back to work for previous wages—combined with concerns over health and safety—we’re now seeing long-term impacts that are affecting the current inflation.
The gist of the issue is that government-sponsored unemployment benefits pay workers not to work, which causes a shortage of workers. Ultimately, this leads to businesses having to raise wages above the unemployment benefits.
As such, businesses are having to pivot and restructure their approach to compensation and employment. While some businesses will be able to adapt to the demand for higher wages in order to ensure they have the staff they need to support their operations, many small businesses will not.
4.Poor Government Policies:
Bad government policies can impact inflation—most specific to our current circumstances are those regarding fossil fuels. If you have a car, you’ve likely seen gas prices rising over the last year.
While these policies need to be addressed, this isn’t a quick fix. U.S. oil production and refining have been down this year due to several causes including Hurricane Ida, which impacted oil supply. Pair that with oil-exporting countries not providing enough, and there are supply constraints on both sides of the equation.
With supply constraints and the current increase in demand for gasoline, prices don’t look to be coming back down in the near future.
Now that we have a better idea of what factors are contributing to inflation most recently, let’s take a look at inflation causes through a more generalized lens.
What Are the General Causes of Inflation?
It’s important to take the time to dive deeper into inflation as a whole so you can better understand how and why inflation occurs and how that plays into the economic impact consumers experience.
There are two broad, general causes of inflation. Each is also its own type of inflation and requires its own unique response from policymakers. The two main causes of inflation are:
Demand-pull inflation: Demand-pull inflation occurs in a strong economy. Incomes are increasing, people are being paid more, more people are at work, and they are demanding more goods and services. This decreases the total number of goods and services available—more people can afford the limited supply of existing goods and services. This, in turn, raises prices. In general, some demand-pull inflation is a sign of a functioning economy, as people are working and earning enough money to demand everything that’s produced.
Cost-push inflation: Cost-push inflation is caused by an increase in the cost of goods due to causes on the supply end. For example, if the costs of raw materials go up significantly, and businesses cannot keep up production of manufactured goods, this causes the manufactured goods sold at the market to be more expensive. Natural disasters, pandemics, and rising oil prices may all result in cost-push inflation, for example. Many different economic conditions can result in cost-push inflation, and it’s something policymakers may worry about, as cost-push inflation can be difficult to rein in.
We’ll go into more detail below about the typical causes of cost-push and demand-pull inflation. For more about inflation, check out the definition of inflation and our free inflation calculator here.
Causes of Demand-Pull Inflation
Demand-pull inflation happens whenever there’s an increase in the amount of goods and services that people want to purchase. Some of the most common causes of demand-pull inflation include:
Economic growth: As economies grow, and people have more money, they feel more confident in their ability to buy goods and services. This causes the costs of goods and services to increase, as a greater number of people can now afford a larger amount of scarce products.
The expectation of inflation: Sometimes, if enough people, especially large companies, expect inflation to come, they increase their prices in anticipation of coming inflation. This expectation itself then causes its own inflation.
Government spending: Some people believe that excessive government spending may cause inflation. For example, enhanced social benefits programs that supply people with the money they need to purchase essential goods they need to live may slightly increase consumer purchasing power. Additionally, some monetary policies, like printing more money to fund spending, may also contribute to inflation.
Increased demand for exports: When the demand for exports increases, this creates a complicated situation where the currencies involved in the exchange may both experience some inflation.
Causes of Cost-Push Inflation
Cost-push inflation occurs whenever the supply end of the production chain experiences cost increases. That includes situations like:
Raw material costs: Sometimes, the price for raw materials increases. For example, there may be a shortage of a certain type of metal that a computer manufacturer needs to produce computer chips. This will increase the cost of the consumer item, the computer, as the company will likely have to spend more money to obtain the metal they need. Increased prices for oil are another common example—when gas is more expensive, companies have to pay more to ship their products around, so they raise their prices.
Labor costs increase: If the price of labor goes up, the cost of the goods the labor is used to produce is likely to go up as well. For example, if workers are being underpaid, goods and services may have artificially low prices. Then, if workers organize for a fair or living wage, and the cost of labor goes up, goods and services may begin to cost more than the artificially suppressed price, causing inflation.
Unforeseen production obstacles: The goods and services we buy often have parts from all over the world, and require massive amounts of travel to arrive at our local stores. If there’s a drought in a country that supplies a certain crop to an American manufacturer, or a hurricane near an important port, or a pandemic that makes it dangerous for workers to labor in close proximity to each other, companies may face steep increases in the cost of production.
In addition to these two broad types of inflation, there are also many factors that can influence inflation. We’ll go over those next.
Factors That Can Influence Inflation
When policymakers and other experts are concerned about inflation, the following are some of the most common factors that they monitor:
If the cost of production increases, it’s likely that companies will also increase the cost of goods and services. As noted above, this is one of the causes of cost-push inflation.
When the prices of goods go up (whether because of cost-push or demand-pull inflation), this is a sign that general inflation across the economy may be looming.
If the demand for goods is increasing—for example, because there is low unemployment—it’s likely that the cost for goods will increase too, at least before production can catch up. That may spur some inflation.
Skilled labor availability
The availability of skilled labor is another potential cause of inflation. If labor necessary to produce certain products is scarce, then it’s likely the cost of those products will increase.
New technologies often cause disruptions to sectors of the economy. Depending on the way this goes, it may increase demand for certain products, may increase supply, or may increase costs somewhere along the supply chain. All of these factors can affect inflation.
The amount of money currently in circulation can also have an effect on the state of inflation. When there is more money in the economy, it may make the relative value of a unit of currency (like $1) go down. This is why some economists believe that printing more money to pay for government spending could result in inflation.
Counteracting the Effects of Inflation
A little bit of inflation is normal in most economies, but rapid inflation can be detrimental to society, as people can no longer afford many of the goods and services that they rely on. This leads many economists and policy analysts to wonder what inflation’s causes are, and how its adverse effects can be stopped.
The ways that governments can counteract the effects of inflation vary depending on the type of inflation that’s occurring, and the factors that are causing it. Economists are also not in agreement about the best ways to approach inflation. It’s an area that still needs a lot more study.
That’s not particularly helpful when you’re facing high rates of inflation in the present moment. However, that doesn’t mean you’re a sitting duck completely at the mercy of the economy.
As an individual, there are steps you can take to ensure that your money isn’t being adversely affected by inflation:
Invest when you can. Money sitting in a savings account is, because of inflation, slowly losing purchasing power. If you start investing in the stock market, bonds, or other high-yield options, you can offset the effects of inflation (while also incurring other risks). Investing in property, like a home, can also be an effective way to offset inflation, as property often appreciates in value over time.
Ask for a raise. If you haven’t received a raise in months or years, it’s possible that your real rate of pay has decreased. That’s because, as inflation goes up, your monthly paycheck may not go as far. Working for and asking for raises to meet inflation is one way you can offset its effects.
Organize your workplace. If you and your coworkers have not received raises, it may be time to think about workplace organizing. By banding together with your coworkers and committing to deny your labor until your wages are increased, you can secure a higher wage and offset the effects of inflation.
According to the Joint Economic Committee, prices are increasing at a faster pace right now than they have in decades, which is increasing concerns over inflation. While there’s no real emergency, now’s as good a time as any to take proactive measures.

The Wall Street Journal published an article on Tuesday claiming that the country’s current inflation woes can be traced to bad weather — though, curiously, the article did not mention “climate change” as the cause of dramatic weather events.
The Journal ‘s Ryan Dezember wrote:
Policy makers and investors have debated the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation, but a big reason for rising prices this year have been factors that neither lawmakers nor central banks can do much about. Prices for natural gas, lumber, corn, soybeans, wheat and other building blocks of modern commerce surged to multiyear highs—in some cases records—because of fire, freezes, flood, drought, hurricanes and some of the hottest weather ever.
…
It all started in February when Texas froze over. Winter Storm Uri drove up demand for natural gas for heat while clogging wells with ice, which drastically reduced production in the region that needed fuel to stay warm.
…
In South America, the worst drought in decades scorched growing regions, wilting Brazil’s export corn crop and leaving the Paraná River too shallow for fully loaded boats to pass from Argentina’s interior to Atlantic shipping lanes. By mid-May, corn and soybean futures had risen to their highest prices in several years.
Drought struck North America, drying up hydropower in the West. One big hydropower station in northern California had to be shut down completely when Lake Oroville dropped beneath the water level needed to generate electricity. Natural gas and coal were burned to cover the shortfall, driving up prices.

Critics of the radical environmentalist movement have noted that the left tends to blame everything on climate change.
An editorial three years ago in Investor’s Business Daily observed: “Pick a topic and add ‘climate change’ to it in a Google search and you’re likely to find some article or study suggesting a connection between the two.”
Other explanations for inflation have tended to focus on a surge in consumer demand, a glut of federal spending, and low interest rates from the Federal Reserve, as well as supply chain problems caused by a variety of management inefficiencies.

Alright, so I've got these search results from different sources. Let's see what they say about what's causing recent inflation.

First, there's an article from The Motley Fool titled "What's Causing All This Inflation?" It lists several factors contributing to inflation. According to the author, Matt Frankel, the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy is one of them. He mentions that the Fed has been keeping interest rates low and injecting liquidity into the economy through quantitative easing, which can lead to inflation.

Another factor he points out is the significant amount of stimulus provided by the government, including stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits, and other forms of economic support during the pandemic. This increased the amount of money in people's hands, leading to higher demand for goods and services.

Supply chain disruptions are also highlighted as a major cause. The article mentions that automakers are facing chip shortages, leading to fewer new cars being produced, which in turn drives up used car prices. There are also shortages in other sectors, like food service, causing prices to rise.

Lastly, wage pressure is mentioned as another factor. With a shortage of workers in certain industries, companies are raising wages to attract employees, and these increased labor costs are being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Another article from The Motley Fool, "5 Reasons Inflation Is Rising in Summer 2021," expands on these points. It lists five reasons for inflation:

1. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

2. Government stimulus measures.

3. Increased demand as the economy reopens.

4. Supply chain disruptions.

5. Wage pressure due to labor shortages.

The third document is from Macrobond Blog, titled "What's causing inflation right now?" It focuses on commodity prices, particularly in metals, agriculture, and energy. The article notes that while some commodity prices have stabilized, others like food and energy continue to rise, contributing to inflation. It also mentions that shipping costs have surged due to supply chain disruptions, which adds to the cost of goods.

The fourth source is from Public Yield, "What Are the Main Causes of Inflation? Current Causes of Inflation." It identifies four main causes of current inflation:

1. Increase in the money supply.

2. Supply chain disruption.

3. Government-sponsored unemployment benefits.

4. Poor government policies, particularly regarding fossil fuels.

This article emphasizes that the increase in the money supply has devalued the U.S. dollar and led to higher inflation. It also points out that government unemployment benefits have created labor shortages, forcing businesses to raise wages, which in turn increases prices.

The fifth and final article is from Breitbart News, "Wall Street Journal: Inflation Is Caused by Bad Weather." This piece discusses a Wall Street Journal article that attributes inflation to extreme weather events affecting commodity prices. It mentions examples like a freeze in Texas affecting natural gas prices, droughts in South America impacting corn and soybean crops, and droughts in North America reducing hydropower generation and increasing reliance on natural gas and coal.

So, summarizing these sources, the main causes of recent inflation appear to be:

- Expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, leading to increased money supply.

- Government stimulus measures injecting money into the economy.

- Increased consumer demand as economies reopen post-pandemic.

- Supply chain disruptions causing shortages and higher prices.

- Labor shortages leading to wage increases, which are passed on to consumers.

- Extreme weather events affecting commodity prices.

It's interesting to note that while some sources emphasize monetary policy and stimulus as key factors, others highlight supply-side issues like supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Additionally, the Breitbart article points to weather events as significant contributors to inflation through their impact on commodity prices.

Given this information, it seems that inflation is being driven by a combination of factors, including both demand-pull and cost-push elements. The increase in money supply and stimulus measures have boosted demand, while supply chain disruptions and higher production costs due to various factors are limiting supply and increasing prices.

Therefore, the answer to "what has caused recent inflation" is a multifaceted one, involving a mix of monetary policy, government spending, economic recovery dynamics, supply chain issues, labor market tightness, and external factors like weather events affecting commodity prices.

\boxed{\text{Recent inflation has been caused by a combination of expansionary monetary policy, government stimulus measures, increased consumer demand, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages leading to higher wages, and extreme weather events affecting commodity prices.}}
