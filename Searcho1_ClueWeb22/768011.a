Alright, so I need to figure out how society affects behavior. Hmm, that's a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down. First off, what do we mean by "society"? Society generally refers to a group of people living together in an organized way, with shared rules, norms, and values. So, it's about the collective behavior and interactions of people in a community.

Now, behavior is how individuals act or conduct themselves. So, the question is essentially asking how the collective nature of a community influences individual actions. I think there are several ways this happens.

First, there are social norms. These are the unwritten rules about how to behave in different situations. For example, in some societies, it's normal to greet others warmly, maybe with a handshake or a hug, while in others, it might be more reserved. These norms shape how individuals interact with each other.

Second, there's peer pressure. People often feel compelled to conform to the behaviors and attitudes of their peers to be accepted. This can influence everything from fashion choices to risky behaviors like smoking or drinking.

Third, cultural values play a big role. Different societies place different emphases on values like independence, collectivism, respect for authority, and so on. These values are instilled from a young age and greatly influence how people make decisions and act.

Fourth, legal and political systems also affect behavior. Laws are a formal set of rules that dictate what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. The enforcement of these laws shapes societal behavior.

Fifth, economic factors can influence behavior. For example, in societies where education leads to better job opportunities, there might be a stronger emphasis on academic achievement.

Lastly, media and technology play a significant role in shaping behaviors and attitudes. Exposure to certain types of content can influence opinions and actions.

I think to really answer this question well, I should look into some specific examples or studies that demonstrate these points. Maybe I can find some research on how societal changes have led to shifts in behavior over time.

Let me consider conducting a search to find some concrete examples or theories on this topic.

5 Social Influence Examples and How They Affect Us Daily - The Strategic Marketing Group
5 Social Influence Examples and How They Affect Us Daily
Art Remnet
These social influence examples at their root are how people might behave depending on the social environment in which they are situated. An individual’s attitude may change depending on the person’s inclination to adjust to a social group or stand out. A personal belief and thought process can change, which affects a person’s adopted behavioral patterns.
There are five social influence examples – informational, normative, conformity, compliance, and obedience. These social influence examples easily demonstrate how our surroundings drive humans and to be aware of them.
5 Social Influence Examples
1. Informational
When you decide based on information that someone else provided, that is informational social influence. This social influence comes from your desire to be correct. You adjust your opinions to the way people think in the hopes of proper judgment.
2. Normative
Normative social influence is a person’s desire to change because they want to be accepted or fit in. Peer pressure is one of the most common examples of this social influence. Individuals who are influenced by normative factors engage in vices. For example, smoking, drinking, or other misbehavior practices to gain the bullies’ approval.
3. Conformity
When individuals change their behavior or beliefs to be accepted, impress or gain a sense of acceptance, conformity occurs. Whether a person has the same opinions or not to a group, it doesn’t matter. The only thing that truly matters to them is to gain admiration from the people they hope to impress.
4. Compliance
If an individual changes the way they behave, that is compliance. However, compliance is not in congruence with obedience. Compliance is usually seen when a friend asks you for a favor, and you agree.
5. Obedience
Compared to compliance, where a person changes their behavior because of a peer or an equal. In contrast, the power dynamics in obedience are changed. In obedience, a person changes because of a person of authority.
The different social influences affect how we act, whether it is evident to us or not. A person’s standing in society can determine how much they will conform with an individual. A teacher will be respected and obeyed by his students. A student will comply with their classmates’ request for a piece of their snack. A General will act differently in front of his cadets than when he is with his commander-in-chief. A person’s behavior can also be influenced, especially by those who are part of a majority. The people within the group will be pressed to follow, while those not included in the group will change to become a part of the group.
In summary, there are existing belief systems that influence the way we think and behave in society. Even our faith greatly influences how we move both within the religious group we belong to and how we act outside the group.
There is so much more to learn about social influence and the role it plays in our society. Understanding social influence means that you capitalize on using social influence tactics when you put your marketing strategies together. Social media influence is evidence that social influence works.

How does society influence behavior?
Every person is born into a socio-cultural setting. He has his own family, community, culture, and groups that help build his identity. These social settings affect the manner a child learns to think and behave, by means of instruction, rewards and punishment, and example.
Another factor that helps shape one’s character is his interaction with friends, relatives, and the media. How he will respond to all these influences tends to be unpredictable. More often than not, however, he responds to such situations according to the pattern of influences, that is, he bases his actions and behavior on the actions of most of the people around him and on the culture he has been raised by his parents.As an individual grows, he develops attitudes which influence his behavior. He starts internalizing the attitudes of the society around him by adopting such attitudes as his own. He also lives up to the cultural expectations about how to behave.
How does society affect individuals?
This is done through socialization.The individual does not automatically absorb cultural attitudes and roles, though. Instead, he accepts them first. Though usually unaware of his acceptance of these attitudes and roles, these are often accepted unconsciously.There are cases, however, when one’s culture conflicts with individual beliefs.
In most cases, a person acts as if he agrees with the society’s perceived social expectations because he does not want to disappoint the people who
...
expect him to meet a particular set of requirements. Situations like this create an imbalance which may cause one’s behavior to become illogical due to perceived social influences.While there are a lot of factors in the society that shape a person’s behaviors, there are also certain factors that change his behavior, ethics, and views on life. These factors cannot be assumed under any circumstance, though.
Explaining the behavior of a person whom you have just met is impossible. Some factors can help explain their behavior such as age, ethnicity, and religion. An old man’s mature behavior, for instance, can be assumed by his age. The class into which people are born also affects his language, interests, and perceptions of the social world.
How does society influence our identity?
Membership in various groups also influences how a person thinks of himself and how others think of him. These groups impose expectations and rules that make the behavior of members more predictable and that enable each group to function smoothly and retain its identity.In the field of science, scientists agree that behavior is developed by environmental expression as well as genetic factors. However, several arguments have sprouted. Some argued that socially expected behavior drives the behavior of an individual while others held that individual expression is characterized by uniqueness and self-introspection.
There were also some scientists who took hold of the viewpoint that behavior is developed through both individual expressions as well as culturally learned normative behavior.No matter which of the theories are true, one thing is certain: that society guides the course of the people within it. Society controls the people through

mores and folkways. Social mores remain to be the most important code of conduct. Violations of these mores result in some forms of punishments.
On the other hand, violations of folkways often result in exclusion or general feeling of social disapproval.Whatever the situation is, it is important to note that the behaviors of individuals are not set in stone. There are really some who will follow the guidelines set by society and there are those who will continue to color outside the lines. No matter how disobedient a person is to the laws and norms of the society, however, there is no denying that society still affects his behavior in one way or the other.
As the Tabula Rasa Theory states, we are born like a blank sheet of paper. How and what we become is greatly attributed to the society we live in as it undeniably shapes and affects our personality and our behavior.

Sociology is defined as the study of social life of human beings. It helps social analysts to understand the working of human beings and society (Moore Kelly, 2008). Relationship between the individual and society has formed the major basis of sociological principles.
George Ritzer’s Integration model:
Ritzer’s model is a good example of sociological theory based on integrationist approach. It combines both macro and micro level theories in it. According to him, there are four highly interdependent elements in the society which are a macro objective component, a micro objective component, a macro subjective component, a micro subjective component. This theory is beneficial in understanding the society in both objective and subjective levels. It also aims at understanding the society norms and individual benefits from the society (Ritzer et al., 2003).
Adapted from (Ritzer et al., 2003)
According to this theory, all the four components are distinct and interdependent to influence the society. It emphasizes that individuals can change cultural norms and society according to their behaviour.
Behaviour of the individual doesn’t essentially influence the society. However certain habits may create positive or negative effect on the society. When a individual tries and modifies their bodies away from the knowledge of the society, it makes no difference. However, when individual tries to modify the society by habits and behaviour, it creates a social impact.
According to Ann swindler, ideology is a determining factor for influencing empowerment in the society and body modification is one such ideology. Body modification increased rapidly in the western countries over the years and slowly spreading to other countries as a trend of fashion. Body modification refers to changes to the external appearance of the body by using devices or fashion to change the body rapidly or gradually. Some of the body modifications include tattooing, piercing, cutting, branding, inserting rings or studs to ears, navel, nose, eye brows (Featherstone, 1999). Body modification can also be extended to the practices such as gymnastics, dieting and physical exercising techniques to alter the existing body structure. These modifications are gradually occurring and take a period of time to get noticeable (Featherstone, 1999).

Use of technology in body modifications is another additional practice, and this includes wearing spectacles for clear vision, using hearing aids and various body implants at heart, kidney and skin surfaces. Use of these modifications is necessary in normal functioning of a body in absence of regular controlled physiological process. When the body tends to become weak or unable to resist changes, these technological devices and nano technological products are used within or over the body to improve health condition and reduce pain in human beings (Featherstone, 1999).
Science and fiction influence body modification procedures indirectly by fascination and intention to follow or copy. Films are the major sources of science fiction and some of them include Robocop (Paul Verhoeven, 1987), Blade runner (Michael Deeley and Ridley Scott, 1982). Some of the films also emphasized on cyberspace and its influences which markedly improved fashion sense of human beings (William Gibson, 1986).
Media and magazines are alternatively cheaper resources to human beings which influence fashion. These resources create a cultural impact on human beings to adapt very commonly to makeovers and changeovers. Cultural aspects of the society have been gradually changing through media (Featherstone, 1982, 1991). Society tends to copy the fashion culture and adapts to it rapidly. Clothing is one such example, which changed over the years from extensive heavy clothing to lighter loose clothing exposing the skin (Bourdieu, 1978; Featherstone, 1987). However, these changes could create a wrong social and cultural impact on the society when wrongly used and interpreted in certain circumstances (Lloyd, 1996).
One of the major body modifications noticed almost everywhere is body building in men and dieting practices in women to change their body pattern to an entirely different look. According to Lee Monaghan, Males tend to in habitat the culture of musculature increasingly and depend on gym and training centres to shape out the body. They tend to adapt these changes to gain the attention of women and society. Females, on the other hand are in a trend of zero-size and slim versions and depend drastically on gym and dieting centres to shred the extra fat away (Featherstone, 1999). These attempts by the society although improves the heath and physique of an individual, it also brings some deleterious changes in the human body. Some of the changes include unimaginable body shapes after rigorous work outs and change in the feminine body structure in females. According to Roberta, not every body reacts in the similar manner to technology and exercise. Some bodies tend to improve and some tend to become abnormal in look and sense. In certain women, changeovers and makeovers could lead to deleterious effects such as change in feminine features (Doug Aaoki, 1996). She describes the use of lipsticks and feminine aids to restore the lost feminity. Regardless of all these attempts, it appears as ‘gender crossing dressing’ to the society (St Matin and Gavey, 1996). Many of the body modifications are irreversible and hence care should be taken in order to adapt to them.

Many of the body modifications are based on changing culture and fashion. Improving with fashion is different from complete transformation. Many of the body modifications cannot be reversed and irreversible body modifications are a risk to try (Paul sweetman). Sweetman describes that fashion trends vary from person to person and permanence of fashion depends on the type of body modifications he is willing to adapt. According to Polhemus and Procter (1978), body modifications are anti-fashion trend followed in modern days and is a means of escapism to avoid the traditional attire. Giddens (1991) supports the context by description of ‘body project’ whereby tradition is dissolved in modern times with relevant excuse of fashion trends.
Positive influence of body modifications on the society:
Body modifications are seen as positive phenomenon by various sociologists. Many of them describe it as growing modern with the changing world. Shildrick describes that society tends to change rapidly and body modification is an enhancement procedure to individualise and identify ones own self separately and uniquely. The positive aspect of modifying body according to the latest trends to inculcate modernity in the system is appreciated by many modern sociologists.
In addition, Society has gained a lot from using certain body modifications to ease their lifestyle (Featherstone, 1999). Use of spectacles and hearing aids has improved style of living with betterment. Adventures in surgical and clinical field by body implants of heart, kidney and artificial limbs have created a milestone. Use of these clinical modifications reduced mortality rate and improved longetivity of life (Featherstone, 1999). Use of artificial limbs has paved an ease of lifestyle for the physically challenged people. This improved their lifestyle and increased chances of competition and survival in complex modern life.
Body project as described by Giddens (1991) is complex and scrutinising the body projects by individuals for their own benefit has become a common practice in modern times. Use of clinical, scientific body modifications for the individual benefit is encouraged by many socialists and has become a common practice in all the places of the world. According to Virilio, body modifications are part of third technological revolution (Armitage, 1999).
Negative influence of body modifications on the society:
Some sociologists have rightly said that great inventions or developments are always followed by potential risk to the society. The modern society has incorporated many body modifications as a part of their lifestyle. Many sociologists discuss that although human beings neglect the fast pace of time, time is always reflected in the body change (Featherstone, 1999).
Society has imbibed the craze of fashion and body modifications to the maximum and these changes tend to be irreversible and deleterious in certain conditions. One of the most objectionable body modifications is cutting and piercing. Insertion of studs and rings to various parts of the body has become a common practice in modern days. Victoria Pitts argues that body modification is seen as factor of mutilation by the media and severely leads to certain mental disorders. Irvine Walsch (1993) describes the body modification as a craze and addiction to the society.
Conclusion:
In the modern era, body modification and fashion have become a common trend. Society has reacted to the new change increasing over the period of time. Although there is a positive impact of the new change in the society, the negative phenomenon is also associated along with it. Sociologists have mixed reactions to the change. The positive factor considered is reformation in medicine and improvement of human beings. The negative impact associated with it is craze, addiction and racism associated with the new fashion trend.

Examples of Social Influence and Psychology, majority group pressure.
Social Influence Examples & Psychology | Study Coach
GCSE Psychology: What is Psychology and Social Influence? Psychology is the study of Mind and Behaviour, the study of Psychology makes use of scientific procedures. Psychology is therefore categorised as a science. In studying psychology, students should expect to conduct research (qualitative and quantitative) carry out experiments and use measurement to predict human behaviour. From conducting experiments and case studies, leading psychologists have created their own unique approaches/perspectives to provide us with knowledge and understanding of the human mind and behaviour. Example of approaches: Social Learning, Behaviourism, Cognitive, Humanism, Psychoanalysis, Biological. There are different branches of psychology, for example: Developmental Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology.
The GCSE curriculum will introduce you to a number of psychological approaches, but examination boards do differ, so when studying keep the focus on your particular board, for example: aqa.org.uk ocr.org.uk qualifications.pearson.com Let’s now consider an aspect of Social Psychology.
SOCIAL INFLUENCE
The study of Social Influence falls under the category of social psychology.
What is Social Influence? The answer is that Social Influence provides an explanation of how the presence of others (group pressure) can influence an individual’s attitudes and beliefs. Social Influence can impact on the way someone will think, feel and behave. For example an influential social media personality can influence their followers attitudes towards life, they can influence followers beliefs, determine how followers feel, think and behave.  Majority (group pressure) can therefore influence an individual and so can Minority (a social influencer) influence a group of people. To be a social media influencer or simply to be able to influence school friends, acquaintances, strangers or the general public, is to occupy a powerful position. Here is an example of Social Influence:
SOCIAL INFLUENCE EXAMPLE – BEHAVIOUR
“Tina is first in the queue for lunch and she decides to have a salad. Tina’s friends join the queue and chose sandwiches for lunch. After seeing this Tina decides to have a sandwich instead of a salad”. Now, the question is why did Tina have a change of mind and decided not to have a salad after noticing that all her friends had chosen sandwiches. Social Influence would suggest that Tina is unsure about her own judgement about what to eat at lunchtime and so she accepts the action of her friends. If the friendship was recently formed it is possible that Tina is still seeking approval and acceptance from her new friends and therefore not wanting to be the odd one out Tina decides not to have a salad but instead to join her friends and choose sandwich for lunch.
How the presence of others can have an impact on our choice of food might seem to be a trivial example, but if we can be so easily influenced in regard to our taste and preference, being influenced might become the norm and impact on more serious issues.
GCSE/A Level Psychology Social Influence – Study Coach
SOCIAL INFLUENCE EXAMPLE – HOW YOU FEEL & THINK
Example: Henry and four of his friends witnessed a fellow student being bullied. The next day during break time Henry told his friends that he felt sad and upset with himself for not reporting the bullying, since bullying is wrong and being a bystander to bullying is more or less supporting bullying. Furthermore, Henry told his friends that they should report the incident to a teacher. Henry was somewhat surprised when his friends told him that he should stop acting like a baby and that he would be a snitch if he reported the incident to a teacher. The boys told Henry that they would no longer be friends if Henry reported the bullying. Henry reflected on what was said and decided not to report the bullying incident.
From the example it should be quite clear that Henry was feeling upset in regard to the bullying incident, his conscience was bothering him. Henry felt that he had a moral duty to report the incident. On the other hand Henry’s friends felt that the incident shouldn’t be reported and that Henry would be acting as an informer (snitch).
You should apply your knowledge of social influence to explain the process of group pressure and how pressure from Henry’s group of friends influenced Henry to change his mind about reporting the bullying incident. When applying psychological knowledge on social influence do consider whether the pressure from others (in this case Henry’s friends) should be categorised as ‘real group pressure’ or ‘imagined group pressure’.

What are some examples of social influences that occur around us on a daily basis? Describe some of the social influences, both positive and negative, that influence behavior.
Social influence refers to the way that people's actions and beliefs are shaped by social context. For instance, consider how people's behavior conforms to that of others when entering a schoolroom or workplace for the first time. In a positive light, social influences can create concern for others, such as giving up your train seat to a senior citizen. But these influences can also create negative social pressures, such as beauty standards that lower people’s self-esteem.

Social influences constantly surround us. For example, consider what it’s like on the first day of school. When you enter a new classroom, do you sit or stand? Do you talk to other people who are already there or do you sit quietly? You would likely observe what other people are doing and follow their lead. In this scenario you would be influenced by and conforming to the social norm.
The school example could be positive or negative, but there are other examples in which it is more obvious. For instance, consider what it’s like to ride a public train during rush hour. Typically, when there are no available seats and a senior citizen comes on, someone sitting down will stand so the older person can sit. Other seated people might then do the same. While it is not an enforced rule of public transit that you must give up your seat, it is an action that many tend to do out of social concern for others.
Social influences also impact the way people view the world. For example, consider people who are raised religious. These people may have specific beliefs about the existence of an afterlife or believe that abstaining from certain actions are a necessary way of life.
While many social influences can be positive, there are just as many that can be negative. For example, consider the influence that social media has on people’s self esteem. The existence and widespread use of social media tends to enforce cultural beauty standards. Oftentimes this creates a social pressure to look or act a certain way in order to be deemed attractive. This can make users compare themselves to others and doubt their self-worth. In some cases, this may even motivate people to practice unhealthy behaviors to alter their appearance.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered some information on how society affects behavior. It seems like there are several key points here.

First, there's the concept of social influence, which includes things like social norms, peer pressure, and conformity. These are all ways that society shapes how individuals behave. For example, if everyone in a group is doing something, like wearing certain clothes or behaving in a certain way, individuals might feel pressured to do the same to fit in.

Second, cultural values play a big role. Different societies have different values and beliefs, and these are passed down through generations, influencing how people think and act.

Third, there are legal and political systems that set rules and regulations, which naturally influence behavior by dictating what is acceptable and what isn't.

Fourth, economic factors can shape behavior. For instance, in societies where education leads to better job opportunities, there might be a stronger emphasis on academic achievement.

Lastly, media and technology have a significant impact on behavior and attitudes. Exposure to certain types of content can influence opinions and actions.

Looking at these points, I can see that society affects behavior in numerous ways, and these influences can be both positive and negative.

Let me think about some specific examples to illustrate this.

Take social norms, for instance. In some cultures, it's normal to greet others with a kiss or a hug, while in others, a nod or a handshake is more appropriate. These norms guide our behavior in social interactions, and deviating from them can lead to misunderstandings or discomfort.

Peer pressure is another powerful influence. Adolescents, in particular, often feel the need to conform to their peers' behaviors, whether it's dressing a certain way, listening to specific music, or engaging in activities like drinking or smoking. This can have both positive and negative consequences, depending on the behavior in question.

Conformity is closely related to peer pressure. Solomon Asch's conformity experiments showed how people will often conform to the majority opinion, even if it's clearly incorrect. This demonstrates how strong the influence of the group can be on an individual's behavior.

Cultural values also shape behavior. For example, in individualistic cultures like the United States, there's a greater emphasis on personal achievement and independence, whereas in collectivist cultures like Japan, the needs of the group are prioritized over individual desires. These differences influence how people make decisions and interact with others.

Legal and political systems provide a framework for behavior. Laws against theft, violence, and other harmful actions help maintain order and safety in society. At the same time, political ideologies can influence behaviors related to voting, protest, and civic engagement.

Economic factors also play a role. In capitalist societies, the pursuit of wealth and material success is often valued, which can influence career choices and work ethic. In contrast, in more egalitarian societies, there might be a greater emphasis on work-life balance and communal well-being.

Media and technology have a profound impact on behavior. Advertising can influence consumer behavior, promoting certain products and lifestyles. Social media can shape opinions and behaviors through the spread of information and the influence of online communities.

It's also worth noting that society can affect behavior through less direct means, such as through education, religion, and family structures. These institutions transmit values and norms that guide individual behavior.

Moreover, society can influence behavior through sanctions and rewards. Positive behaviors are often rewarded with praise or incentives, while negative behaviors are punished through fines, imprisonment, or social ostracism.

In terms of negative influences, society can perpetuate harmful behaviors and attitudes. For example, societal norms around gender roles can limit individual freedom and lead to inequality. Prejudice and discrimination are also societal phenomena that can negatively impact behavior and well-being.

Additionally, the pressure to conform to societal standards can lead to mental health issues like anxiety and depression, particularly when individuals feel they don't measure up to expectations.

On the positive side, society can foster cooperation, empathy, and prosocial behavior. Social support networks can provide assistance during times of need, and collective action can lead to positive change.

In conclusion, society profoundly affects behavior through a multitude of channels, including social norms, cultural values, legal systems, economic structures, and media influences. These influences can be both beneficial and detrimental, shaping how individuals think, feel, and act within their social contexts.

So, my final answer is that society affects behavior through social norms, peer pressure, conformity, cultural values, legal and political systems, economic factors, media and technology, education, religion, family structures, sanctions, and rewards. These influences can be both positive and negative, shaping individual behavior in various ways.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Society affects behavior through social norms, peer pressure, conformity, cultural values, legal and political systems, economic factors, media and technology, education, religion, family structures, sanctions, and rewards.}} \]
