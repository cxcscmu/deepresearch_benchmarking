Okay, so the user is asking whether religion causes war. Let me start by breaking down the question. They want to know the role of religion in conflicts—is it a primary cause or just a factor among others?

First, I need to check the provided search results. Let's go through each one to gather relevant information. 

Search result [1] mentions that less than 10% of conflicts involved religion, according to some studies. But it also says religions often seek peace on their own terms, which can lead to war. So religion isn't the main cause, but it can be a factor when combined with other issues.

Result [2] from Wikipedia states that only about 6.87% of historical conflicts had religion as their primary cause. It also argues that the concept of "religious war" might be a modern construct and that underlying ethnic or political issues are more significant. This supports the idea that religion is often a secondary factor.

Result [3] by Andrew Holt criticizes the myth that religion is the main cause of wars, pointing out that imperialist ideologies have been more prevalent. This emphasizes the role of political and economic motives over religious ones.

Result [4] is a PDF that suggests religion is a motivator, not a motive. It argues that power, greed, and politics are the real causes, with religion used to justify actions. This distinction between motive and motivator is crucial here.

Result [5] from GotQuestions.org states that the primary cause of all war is sin, with religion and ideology as secondary factors. It brings a theological perspective, which might not be academic but still relevant.

Result [6] lists historical holy wars like the Crusades and Thirty Years' War, showing that religion can be a direct cause in some cases. But these examples are specific and not the majority.

Result [7] discusses modern conflicts like Israel-Palestine and Hindu-Muslim tensions, highlighting how religion can intersect with ethnic and political issues. It mentions that true religious understanding might reduce conflict.

Result [8] reviews a book arguing that the concept of "religious violence" is a myth created to justify secularism. It points out that secular ideologies can be just as divisive.

Result [9] from Oxford Research Encyclopedias provides an overview, noting that religion affects war dynamics but isn't the sole cause. It emphasizes the need to study how religion interacts with other factors.

Result [10] from EBSCO mentions both religious motivations for war and peace efforts, indicating a dual role. It cites historical examples but also modern interfaith tensions.

Result [11] is about a Cambridge program on religion and conflict, stressing the complexity and need for nuanced analysis. This academic perspective supports multi-faceted approaches.

Result [12] discusses civil wars and religion, noting that state favoritism and grievances play roles. It's about how religion interacts with state policies rather than being a direct cause.

Result [13] introduces a dataset on religious conflicts, showing that Islamist claims have become more prevalent. This data-driven approach helps quantify religion's role in modern conflicts.

Result [14] from Signs Magazine references atheist views (Dawkins, Harris) claiming religion causes war but counters with examples like WWI and WWII where politics were primary. It argues against oversimplification.

Result [15] talks about the intersection of race, religion, and war in modern contexts like the War on Terror, showing how religion is racialized and used to justify conflicts.

Now, synthesizing these points: The majority of sources agree that religion is rarely the sole cause of war. Instead, it's often intertwined with political, economic, and ethnic factors. Historical data shows a low percentage of conflicts primarily motivated by religion. However, religion can act as a motivator or justifier, especially when combined with other grievances. Modern conflicts often involve religion as part of identity politics rather than theological disputes. The key seems to be that while religion can exacerbate or be used to justify violence, it's not the root cause in most cases. The challenge is disentangling religion from other factors and recognizing how it's instrumentalized by leaders for non-religious aims.

I need to structure the report to address these points. Start with an introduction summarizing the complexity, then sections on historical analysis, case studies, modern conflicts, theoretical perspectives (myth of religious violence), and conclusion. Each section should integrate multiple sources, citing them appropriately. Make sure to highlight both sides—where religion has been a factor and where it's been overstated. Emphasize the interplay with other causes and the importance of context. Avoid lists, use narrative flow, and cite sources inline as per guidelines.

# The Complex Relationship Between Religion and Warfare: A Multifaceted Analysis  

The question of whether religion causes war has ignited fervent debate among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While simplistic narratives often attribute conflicts to religious differences, a closer examination reveals a far more intricate interplay of factors. Historical data suggests that only 6.87% of recorded wars primarily stemmed from religious motives[2][3], yet religion frequently intersects with political, economic, and ethnic tensions to exacerbate hostilities. This report synthesizes evidence from historical case studies, theoretical frameworks, and contemporary conflicts to argue that religion rarely operates as an isolated cause of war but instead functions as a powerful mobilizing force, a cultural marker, or a rhetorical tool for legitimizing violence. The analysis underscores how secular ideologies like nationalism and imperialism have driven far more conflicts than purely religious doctrines, while also acknowledging religion’s unique capacity to deepen divides and sanctify wartime agendas.  

## Historical Analysis of Religion’s Role in Conflict  

### Quantifying Religious Motivations in Pre-Modern Warfare  
The Encyclopedia of Wars documents that just 121 out of 1,763 historical conflicts (6.87%) had religion as their primary cause[2]. For instance, the Crusades (1095–1291) are frequently cited as quintessential religious wars, yet their origins intertwine with territorial ambitions, trade route control, and papal political authority. While Pope Urban II framed the First Crusade as a holy mission to reclaim Jerusalem, feudal lords participated partly to secure land and wealth[6][10]. Similarly, the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), often mischaracterized as a purely Catholic-Protestant clash, involved dynastic rivalries between the Habsburgs and Bourbons, with France—a Catholic power—supporting Protestant states to weaken Habsburg dominance[8][14].  

### Theological Frameworks and Violence  
Major world religions contain paradoxical teachings: they simultaneously advocate peace and, in certain contexts, justify violence. The Qur’an permits defensive warfare (*jihad*) but forbids aggression (2:190), while the Hindu *Bhagavad Gita* upholds *dharma* (duty) for warriors like Arjuna[10]. Christian just war theory, developed by Augustine, condones violence only as a last resort to restore justice[4]. However, these texts are often reinterpreted to suit political agendas. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988), Ayatollah Khomeini invoked *jihad* to rally Iranians against Saddam Hussein’s secular Ba’athist regime, while Iraq framed the conflict as a defense of Arab nationalism against Persian expansion[2][13].  

## Case Studies in the Instrumentalization of Religion  

### The Crusades: Faith and Feudalism  
The Crusades exemplify how religious fervor intersected with material interests. While pilgrims sought spiritual redemption, Italian merchant republics like Venice exploited the campaigns to dominate Mediterranean trade. The Fourth Crusade’s sack of Constantinople (1204), a Christian city, revealed the primacy of economic motives over religious unity[6][10]. Post-crusader kingdoms established feudal systems that prioritized land ownership over evangelism, further undermining the narrative of purely sacred warfare.  

### The Troubles in Northern Ireland: Sectarianism as a Sociopolitical Marker  
Though framed as a Catholic-Protestant conflict, the Troubles (1968–1998) primarily stemmed from British colonial policies that marginalized Irish Catholics. Discrimination in housing, employment, and voting rights fueled demands for civil rights, which unionist factions interpreted as threats to their British identity[2][12]. Paramilitary groups like the Provisional IRA and Ulster Volunteer Force used sectarian symbolism but pursued nationalist and loyalist objectives, respectively[12]. Religious identity here served as a cultural boundary rather than a theological battleground.  

## Modern Conflicts and the Resurgence of Religious Rhetoric  

### Jihadism and Geopolitical Grievances  
The rise of groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS has reignited debates about religion’s role in violence. While these organizations frame their struggles as holy wars, their grievances often center on secular issues: opposition to foreign military presence, authoritarian regimes, and economic inequality. Osama bin Laden’s 1998 fatwa against the U.S. cited the stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia and support for Israel as primary motivations[4][13]. Similarly, Boko Haram’s insurgency in Nigeria exploits widespread poverty and government corruption, using religious rhetoric to recruit disillusioned youths[13].  

### Hindu Nationalism and Communal Violence in India  
The Babri Masjid demolition (1992) and Gujarat riots (2002) highlight how religious identity becomes weaponized in ethnonationalist projects. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has leveraged Hindu majoritarianism to consolidate power, portraying Indian Muslims as outsiders despite their centuries-old presence[7][14]. Economic competition and historical resentments over Partition (1947) amplify these tensions, demonstrating how religion intertwines with postcolonial nation-building.  

## Theoretical Perspectives: Debunking the Myth of Religious Violence  

### The Social Construction of "Religion"  
William T. Cavanaugh’s *The Myth of Religious Violence* (2009) argues that the modern category of "religion" emerged post-Reformation to marginalize theological disputes as irrational compared to secular governance[8]. Early modern states portrayed wars like the Thirty Years’ War as "religious" to legitimize their monopoly on violence, obscuring the role of dynastic ambitions[8]. Similarly, the 19th-century colonial discourse framed non-Western spiritual practices as primitive "religions" needing civilizing, thereby justifying imperial conquests[15].  

### Secular Ideologies and Comparative Violence  
Critics of the "religion causes war" narrative note that secular ideologies have produced unparalleled destruction. The World Wars, responsible for 80–100 million deaths, were driven by nationalism, fascism, and imperial rivalry[5][14]. Communist regimes in the USSR and China killed approximately 100 million civilians through forced collectivization and purges, yet atheism’s role in these atrocities is seldom scrutinized as intensively as religious motives[5].  

## Religion as a Peacebuilding Force  

### Interfaith Dialogue and Conflict Resolution  
Religious institutions often spearhead reconciliation efforts. South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (1995) drew on Christian concepts of forgiveness to heal post-apartheid divisions[9]. In Colombia, Catholic and Protestant leaders mediated between FARC guerrillas and the government, contributing to the 2016 peace accord[9]. The Sant’Egidio Community, a Catholic organization, has brokered ceasefires in Mozambique and the Philippines by leveraging its moral authority[9].  

### Theological Reinterpretations for Nonviolence  
Progressive religious movements have reexamined traditional texts to promote pacifism. Islamic scholars like Khaled Abou El Fadl emphasize the Qur’an’s restrictions on warfare, while Buddhist monks in Thailand and Myanmar resist militarism through teachings on *metta* (loving-kindness)[10][12]. Jewish organizations such as Rabbis for Human Rights advocate for Palestinian rights using Torah principles of justice[*]().  

## Conclusion: Beyond Causal Reductionism  

The evidence overwhelmingly refutes the notion that religion is the primary cause of war. Instead, faith traditions operate within broader ecosystems of power, identity, and resource competition. While doctrinal absolutism can exacerbate conflicts, as seen in sectarian disputes, most violence arises from the manipulation of religious symbolism by secular actors pursuing political or economic ends. Future research must adopt intersectional frameworks that account for how religious identities interact with ethnicity, class, and geopolitics. Policymakers, meanwhile, should prioritize addressing structural inequalities while engaging religious leaders as partners in peacebuilding. Only by moving beyond reductive narratives can we mitigate the complex drivers of conflict in an increasingly pluralistic world.
