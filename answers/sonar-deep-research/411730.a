Okay, so I need to tackle the question: "Does war make states? Rentierism and the formation of states in the Middle East." Let me start by understanding what the user is asking here. They want to know if the theory that war contributes to state formation, as proposed by scholars like Charles Tilly in the European context, applies to the Middle East, especially considering the role of rentierism. 

First, I'll recall Tilly's argument that war-making and state-making are intertwined. In Europe, the need to fund wars forced states to build administrative structures and extract resources, leading to stronger, more centralized states. But the Middle East has a different dynamic because of rentierism—states that rely on external rents (like oil revenues) instead of taxing their populations. 

Looking at the search results provided, several sources discuss this. The first source [1] directly compares Middle Eastern states like Iraq, Jordan, UAE, and Tunisia, noting that rentier states don't follow the "war makes states" model. Instead of building institutions through war, they use external rents to maintain power without needing to build strong bureaucracies or gain societal legitimacy through taxation. That's a key point. 

Source [2] mentions that in the Arab world, wars are funded by external aid or rents, using imported weapons, and peace settlements are often mediated by foreign powers. This means the state doesn't go through the same process of internal resource extraction and bureaucratic development. So war here doesn't lead to state formation in the same way. 

Source [3] argues that rentierism is a better indicator of state formation in the Middle East than war-making. It suggests that because these states don't rely on domestic taxation, they don't develop the same social contracts or institutional strength. This leads to weaker states but ones that can survive through rent distribution. 

Source [4] talks about state formation in the Middle East being influenced by colonial borders and the complexity of managing diverse societies. It adds another layer—external interference and border issues—that complicates state formation beyond just war or rentierism. 

Source [5] looks at the Arab uprisings and how rentier states like Bahrain and Libya had different outcomes. It seems that rentierism can both stabilize and destabilize, depending on how rents are managed. Source [6] explicitly states that in the Middle East, wars destroy states rather than build them, contrasting with Europe. 

Source [7] discusses new forms of rentierism beyond oil, like tourism and remittances, and how they affect conflict. It suggests that traditional rentierism (oil) might lead to conflict, while newer forms could promote growth and reduce repression. 

Source [8] gives a historical perspective, mentioning Turkic invasions and colonial influences, but also that Middle Eastern states had pre-modern state-building processes that made them vulnerable to colonialism. 

Putting this together, the answer seems to be that the Middle Eastern experience challenges Tilly's theory. Rentierism alters the state formation process by reducing the need for taxation and bureaucratic development, making states reliant on external rents. Wars in this context, especially when funded externally, don't lead to stronger states but can contribute to state failure. However, rentierism also allows these states to maintain stability through welfare provision, even if they're institutionally weak.

I need to structure the report to first explain Tilly's theory, then contrast it with the Middle Eastern context, delve into rentierism's role, examine case studies (Iraq, Jordan, UAE, Tunisia), discuss the impact of external interventions and colonialism, and conclude with the implications for state stability and failure. Each section should integrate relevant sources and cite them appropriately. Make sure to avoid lists and keep the narrative flowing with proper citations.

# War, Rentierism, and State Formation in the Middle East: Divergence from European Models  

The relationship between war and state formation has been a central theme in political science since Charles Tilly’s seminal observation that “war made the state, and the state made war” in early modern Europe[1][2]. However, the Middle Eastern experience fundamentally challenges this paradigm. Unlike European states, which developed centralized bureaucracies and fiscal systems through the exigencies of war-making, Middle Eastern states have been shaped by **rentierism**—a system where external revenues (from oil, foreign aid, or strategic rents) replace domestic taxation as the state’s financial backbone[1][3][6]. This report examines how rentierism has altered the trajectory of state formation in the region, producing states that are simultaneously weak in institutional capacity yet resilient due to their ability to distribute rents. By analyzing historical cases, colonial legacies, and contemporary conflicts, it argues that war in the Middle East often undermines state-building efforts, with rentier structures perpetuating a cycle of fragility and survival.

## Theoretical Foundations: Tilly’s Thesis and Its Limitations  

### The European Model of War-Making and State-Making  
In Tilly’s framework, European states emerged through a coercive cycle: rulers extracted resources from populations to fund wars, which in turn necessitated stronger administrative structures to manage taxation and conscription[1][2]. This process fostered accountability mechanisms, as elites and citizens demanded representation in exchange for resources—a dynamic encapsulated in the adage “no taxation without representation”[3]. By the 18th century, this dialectic had produced centralized, bureaucratic states capable of monopolizing violence and delivering public goods[2][6].  

### Rentierism as a Disruptive Force  
Middle Eastern states diverged from this path due to **rentierism**, defined as reliance on externally sourced revenues that bypass domestic taxation[1][3][5]. Oil-rich Gulf states, for example, derive over 80% of their income from hydrocarbon exports, enabling rulers to fund security apparatuses and social services without negotiating with citizens[5][6]. This decouples state-building from societal accountability, creating institutions designed for patronage rather than governance. As Hvidt (2011) notes, rentier states “defy the ‘war makes states’ theory” by outsourcing the fiscal and military pressures that drove European state formation[1][3].

## Rentierism in Practice: Case Studies of State Formation  

### Iraq: From Rentierism to State Collapse  
Iraq’s trajectory illustrates how rentierism and war interact destructively. Prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion, Iraq’s state institutions were sustained by oil revenues, which accounted for 95% of government income[6]. However, Saddam Hussein’s regime prioritized patronage networks over bureaucratic competence, leaving the state vulnerable when external shocks disrupted rent flows. The Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988) and Gulf War (1990–1991) were financed through oil exports and foreign loans, avoiding the need for domestic mobilization[2][6]. When the 2003 invasion dismantled the Ba’athist apparatus, the absence of institutional depth led to catastrophic state failure, militia rule, and sectarian conflict[6][8].  

### Jordan: Rentier Survival Without Resource Wealth  
Jordan’s experience demonstrates how non-oil rentier states leverage strategic rents for stability. Lacking hydrocarbon resources, Jordan relies on foreign aid (notably from the U.S. and Gulf states) and remittances from expatriate workers, which constitute 15–20% of GDP[7][8]. These rents enable the monarchy to fund security forces and subsidize basic goods, circumventing demands for political reform. During the 2011 Arab uprisings, Jordan contained protests through rent distribution, contrasting with regimes in Libya and Syria that faced full-scale revolts[5][7]. Nevertheless, Jordan’s dependence on external rents leaves it vulnerable to shifts in donor priorities, underscoring the precarity of rentier resilience[6][8].  

### The UAE and Tunisia: Contrasting Paths  
A comparison between the UAE (a hydrocarbon rentier) and Tunisia (a non-rentier state) highlights rentierism’s dual effects. The UAE, with its vast oil wealth, has built a “contractor state” that outsources public services to foreign firms while relying on expatriate labor[6][8]. Political participation remains limited, but high per capita rents ensure quiescence. In contrast, Tunisia’s lack of rents forced the Ben Ali regime to extract resources domestically, fueling grievances that culminated in the 2011 revolution[1][5]. Post-revolution, Tunisia’s struggle to build inclusive institutions reflects the challenges of state-making without rentier cushions[5][8].

## Colonialism, Borders, and the Legacy of External Intervention  

### Artificial Borders and Fragmented Societies  
The Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) and subsequent colonial partitions created states with incongruent borders, amalgamating disparate ethnic and sectarian groups[4][8]. For example, Iraq’s borders encompassed Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, creating centrifugal pressures that rentier redistribution only temporarily mitigated[6][8]. Colonial powers also favored co-optation over institution-building, leaving post-independence states with weak administrative capacities[4][8].  

### The Role of Foreign Powers in Conflict Dynamics  
External interventions have exacerbated state fragility by distorting war-making incentives. During the Iran-Iraq War, both combatants received foreign arms and financing, allowing them to prolong the conflict without developing self-sustaining military industries[2][6]. Similarly, the U.S.-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq prioritized rapid regime change over institutional consolidation, leading to power vacuums filled by non-state actors[6][8]. Peace settlements brokered by foreign powers—such as the 1991 Madrid Conference—often prioritized geopolitical stability over local legitimacy, deepening societal fractures[4][8].

## Rentierism’s Paradox: Stability Amid Institutional Weakness  

### Welfare Without Accountability  
Rentier states maintain stability through **rent redistribution**, providing subsidized housing, healthcare, and education in lieu of political rights[1][5][7]. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, for instance, use oil wealth to guarantee public-sector employment and energy subsidies, creating a social contract based on economic security rather than democratic participation[5][7]. However, this model is vulnerable to rent volatility: the 2014–2015 oil price crash forced Gulf states to introduce VAT and reduce subsidies, triggering rare public dissent[5][7].  

### The Failure of War-Making as State-Making  
In Europe, war catalyzed institutional innovation; in the Middle East, it often accelerates state decay. Syria’s civil war (2011–present) has fragmented the state into regime-held enclaves, Kurdish autonomies, and jihadist territories, eroding the centralized bureaucracy that once existed[4][8]. Yemen’s conflict, fueled by Saudi and Iranian interventions, has collapsed state institutions, creating a humanitarian crisis[6][8]. Even Israel, often seen as a “strong” state, relies on U.S. military aid (3.8 billion annually), which reduces pressure to develop autonomous defense industries[7][8].

## Conclusion: Rethinking State Formation in the Rentier Age  

The Middle Eastern experience reveals that rentierism fundamentally alters the war-state nexus. By externalizing fiscal and military pressures, rentier states avoid the accountability mechanisms that strengthened European bureaucracies. This produces hybrid entities: weak in institutional depth yet resilient through rent distribution. However, this resilience is contingent on stable rent flows and geopolitical patronage. As global energy transitions and shifting alliances undermine traditional rentier models, Middle Eastern states face an existential dilemma—either diversify their economies and embrace inclusive governance or risk further fragmentation. Future research should explore how digital technologies and non-hydrocarbon rents (e.g., tourism, renewable energy) might reshape this dynamic, offering pathways to post-rentier statehood.
