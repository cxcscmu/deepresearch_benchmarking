Okay, so I need to figure out whether euthanasia is morally justified. Let's start by breaking down what euthanasia actually means. From the search results, it looks like there are different types—active and passive. Active is when someone does something to cause death, like a lethal injection, while passive is more like withholding treatment. The definitions vary a bit, but Wreen's six-part definition in source [2] includes intention and motive, which seems important.

Now, the moral arguments for and against. The pro-euthanasia side seems to use arguments like autonomy, quality of life, and mercy. Source [5] talks about the argument from quality of life, where if life is worse than death, euthanasia is justified. Then there's the autonomy argument, which is about the right to choose, mentioned in [5] and [10]. John Stuart Mill's harm principle is cited here, saying if it doesn't harm others, it should be allowed. 

On the flip side, religious views, especially Christian ones, strongly oppose euthanasia. Source [7] and [6] mention the sanctity of life as a gift from God, so ending it is wrong. Also, some Christian perspectives see suffering as part of God's plan, like sharing in Christ's passion ([5] and [7]). Then there's the slippery slope argument—if we allow euthanasia, maybe it'll lead to non-voluntary cases or pressure on vulnerable people. Source [6] talks about moral pressure on the elderly and sick if euthanasia is legalized.

Utilitarian perspectives from [8] suggest that if euthanasia maximizes happiness by ending suffering, it's justified. But Kantian ethics, also in [8], would say using a person as a means (even for their own good) is wrong. So there's a conflict between different ethical theories.

Legal aspects come up too. In the US, active euthanasia is illegal, but passive might be allowed in some cases ([1]). The AMA opposes it, advocating for better palliative care instead. The Netherlands and Oregon have specific laws ([12]), which could be examples to look at for how different places handle it.

There's also the distinction between voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary euthanasia. Most agree that involuntary is murder, but non-voluntary (like for someone in a coma) is more debated. The EPAC Ethics Task Force in [2] says only voluntary is euthanasia; others are murder.

The principle of double effect might be relevant too—administering painkillers that might hasten death isn't considered euthanasia if the intent is pain relief. Source [3] discusses this in the context of Christian ethics, where the intent matters.

I should also consider the philosophical foundations. Autonomy and dignity are big in sources [4] and [11], with Kant's emphasis on treating people as ends. But opposing views stress the sanctity of life regardless of quality.

Potential consequences: Legalizing euthanasia might lead to abuse or devalue certain lives, as per [6]. But on the other hand, denying it could force people to suffer against their will. The case from [12] in Oregon shows regulated approaches, which might mitigate some risks.

In the end, the moral justification seems to hinge on balancing autonomy and the right to die with the sanctity of life and potential societal harms. Different ethical frameworks will weigh these differently. The answer isn't straightforward, but the report needs to present all these angles comprehensively, citing the relevant sources.

# The Moral Justification of Euthanasia: A Comprehensive Analysis  

The debate over euthanasia’s moral justifiability remains one of the most contentious in bioethics, intersecting medicine, law, philosophy, and theology. Proponents argue that euthanasia respects individual autonomy, alleviates unbearable suffering, and upholds human dignity, while opponents emphasize the sanctity of life, the risks of abuse, and the moral impermissibility of intentional killing. This report synthesizes these perspectives, examining ethical theories, religious doctrines, legal frameworks, and practical implications to evaluate whether euthanasia can be morally justified.

## Defining Euthanasia: Conceptual Foundations  

### The Nature of Euthanasia  
Euthanasia, derived from the Greek *eu* (good) and *thanatos* (death), refers to intentionally ending a life to relieve suffering. Definitions vary, but philosopher Michael Wreen’s six-part criteria provide a foundational framework: (1) an agent kills or lets die, (2) with intent to cause death, (3) motivated by the patient’s perceived benefit, (4) through a planned causal chain, (5) voluntarily, and (6) without coercion[2]. This distinguishes euthanasia from natural death or unintended consequences of pain management.  

### Active vs. Passive Euthanasia  
Active euthanasia involves direct intervention (e.g., lethal injection), while passive euthanasia entails withholding life-sustaining treatments[2]. Legal systems often treat these differently: passive euthanasia is permitted in many jurisdictions under specific conditions, whereas active euthanasia remains criminalized except in regions like the Netherlands and Oregon[1][12]. The moral distinction hinges on the doctrine of double effect, which permits unintended death if the primary intent is palliation[7].

## Ethical Theories and Moral Arguments  

### The Case for Euthanasia  

#### Autonomy and Self-Determination  
Central to pro-euthanasia arguments is the principle of autonomy—the right to control one’s body and life trajectory. John Stuart Mill’s harm principle asserts that individuals should be free to act unless they harm others[5]. Applied to euthanasia, this implies that voluntary requests to die, absent harm to third parties, should be respected. As Peter Singer argues, denying this choice infringes on personal sovereignty and forces unnecessary suffering[5][12].  

#### Quality of Life and Mercy  
Utilitarian ethics evaluates actions based on outcomes. If a patient’s life entails irreversible suffering with no prospect of improvement, euthanasia may maximize well-being by ending misery[5][8]. Jonathan Glover contends that consciousness and meaningful experiences define life’s value; when these vanish, continued existence becomes a “non-life” devoid of intrinsic worth[5]. For terminal patients enduring relentless pain, death may represent a merciful release rather than a harm[9].  

#### Human Dignity  
Dignity, often linked to autonomy, underscores the right to die with control over one’s final moments. Kantian ethics, while opposing suicide as a violation of duty, paradoxically supports euthanasia when aligned with rational self-determination[4][11]. Modern bioethics reframes dignity as the ability to make coherent choices about one’s existence, even in death[12].  

### The Case Against Euthanasia  

#### Sanctity of Life  
Religious traditions, particularly Christianity, view life as sacred and God-given, making intentional killing morally impermissible. The Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia as a rejection of divine authority, emphasizing redemptive suffering’s spiritual value[7][6]. Exodus 20:13’s injunction against murder extends to self-inflicted death, framing euthanasia as a sin[7]. Eastern Orthodoxy similarly posits that suffering prepares the soul for eternity, rendering euthanasia spiritually detrimental[7].  

#### Slippery Slope Concerns  
Critics warn that legalizing euthanasia could normalize non-voluntary practices, pressuring vulnerable groups (e.g., the elderly, disabled) to end their lives to avoid burdening others[6]. Empirical studies from the Netherlands, where euthanasia is permitted, reveal instances of non-consensual euthanasia, suggesting systemic risks[12].  

#### Ethical Integrity of Medicine  
The Hippocratic Oath’s mandate to “do no harm” traditionally opposes euthanasia. The American Medical Association (AMA) argues that physicians should alleviate suffering through palliative care rather than life-termination[1]. Transforming doctors into agents of death, opponents claim, erodes trust in medical institutions[3].

## Theological and Cultural Perspectives  

### Abrahamic Religions  
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam uniformly reject euthanasia, citing divine ownership of life. The Quran and Ten Commandments explicitly forbid killing[8]. Catholic doctrine, articulated in *Evangelium Vitae*, asserts that euthanasia subverts human dignity by treating individuals as disposable[6][7].  

### Eastern Philosophies  
Buddhism and Hinduism, while valuing non-harm (*ahimsa*), exhibit nuanced stances. Buddhism’s focus on reducing suffering may permit euthanasia in extreme cases, whereas Hindu texts like the *Bhagavad Gita* emphasize accepting death as a natural process, discouraging premature intervention.

## Legal Frameworks and Global Practices  

### Permissive Jurisdictions  
The Netherlands and Belgium permit euthanasia under strict criteria: voluntary request, unbearable suffering, and medical consensus[12]. Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act (1994) allows physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, requiring multiple approvals to prevent coercion[12]. These models prioritize autonomy but face criticism for incremental expansion to non-terminal cases[12].  

### Restrictive Jurisdictions  
Most U.S. states and many countries criminalize active euthanasia, allowing only passive measures (e.g., withdrawing ventilators). The U.K.’s Supreme Court permits withholding treatment but prohibits assisted dying, reflecting tensions between legal and ethical norms[10][12].  

---

## Practical and Societal Implications  

### Palliative Care Alternatives  
Advancements in hospice care challenge euthanasia’s necessity. Palliative sedation and pain management enable pain-free natural deaths, aligning with the AMA’s emphasis on improving life quality without hastening death[1][7]. Critics argue, however, that not all suffering is physical; existential anguish may persist despite medical intervention[5][9].  

### Demographics and Economic Pressures  
Aging populations and rising healthcare costs risk instrumentalizing euthanasia as a cost-saving measure. In countries with socialized medicine, subtle pressures to choose death over prolonged care could undermine voluntariness[6][12].

## Conclusion: Toward a Balanced Approach  

The moral justifiability of euthanasia hinges on reconciling autonomy with safeguards against abuse. While individual rights to die with dignity hold ethical weight, systemic risks demand rigorous oversight. A middle path—permitting euthanasia under narrow conditions while investing in palliative care—respects divergent values without eroding societal trust. Future discourse must addresscultural pluralism, ensuring policies reflect both compassion and reverence for life’s sanctity.
