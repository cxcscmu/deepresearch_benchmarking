Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query: "how can the world stop climate change." Let's start by understanding what they're asking. They want a comprehensive report on the strategies to mitigate and stop climate change. From the search results provided, there's a lot of information on various approaches like reducing emissions, renewable energy, reforestation, international agreements, and even geoengineering.

First, I should outline the major themes. The EU's targets in search result [1] mention a 55% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. That's a key point. Then, the Paris Agreement discussed in [2] and [9] is crucial for global cooperation. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind from [3], [4], and [7] are vital. Carbon capture and geoengineering come up in [12] and [13], which might be more controversial but necessary. Afforestation and reforestation in [5], [14], and agroforestry in [5] are natural solutions. Also, the role of individual actions and policies in [6] and [8] should be included.

I need to structure the report into sections. Maybe start with an introduction summarizing the urgency, then move to international agreements, transitioning to renewable energy, enhancing carbon sinks, technological solutions like carbon capture, individual and policy actions, and conclude with future steps. Each section should have subsections. For example, under international agreements, discuss the Paris Agreement, EU policies, and global cooperation.

Citations are important. Every claim needs to reference the search results. For example, when talking about the EU's 55% target, cite [1]. When discussing the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal, cite [2], [8], [9]. Solar energy's role should reference [3], [4], [7]. Agroforestry's potential comes from [5], and afforestation from [14]. Carbon capture is covered in [13], geoengineering in [12].

I have to make sure the report flows well, with each section building on the previous. Avoid lists, use paragraphs, and ensure each part connects. Also, check that all search results are utilized where relevant. For instance, [10] and [11] talk about net-zero targets and scenarios, which should be in the section on international goals. The IEA's Net Zero Emissions scenario in [11] is a key source for that part.

Potential challenges include integrating diverse strategies without making the report disjointed. Need to show how all these approaches interrelate. Also, balancing mitigation strategies with adaptation, but the query focuses on stopping climate change, so mitigation is the main focus. 

Make sure to mention the need for global cooperation as in [1], [2], [15], and the role of both developed and developing countries. Highlight the importance of not just reducing emissions but also removing CO2, as in [9], [10], [12]. 

In the conclusion, synthesize the main points and stress the necessity of combining all strategies: policy, technology, natural solutions, and international collaboration. Also, touch on the urgency as per the current date in 2025, noting that time is critical to meet 2030 and 2050 targets.

Check for any missed search results. [6] discusses individual actions and the need for multiple strategies, which fits into the policy and individual action section. [7] emphasizes keeping fossil fuels in the ground, which should be a subsection under reducing emissions. [8] provides specific targets for CO2 reduction, useful in the international agreements section.

Alright, with all this in mind, structure the report into the required sections, ensuring each part is well-supported by the provided sources and cited correctly. Keep the tone academic but accessible, avoid jargon, and make sure it's comprehensive, hitting at least the main points from each relevant search result.

# Strategies to Mitigate and Halt Global Climate Change  

The global community faces an unprecedented challenge in combating climate change, with scientific consensus urging immediate and transformative action to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels[2][8]. Achieving this goal necessitates a multifaceted approach integrating international policy frameworks, rapid decarbonization of energy systems, large-scale ecological restoration, and innovative technological solutions. Current projections indicate that existing measures could reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030[1], but accelerating progress requires systemic changes across all sectors of the economy. This report synthesizes evidence from climate agreements, energy transitions, carbon sequestration strategies, and emerging technologies to outline a viable pathway toward climate stabilization.  

## International Policy Frameworks and Multilateral Cooperation  

### The Paris Agreement and Net-Zero Commitments  
The 2015 Paris Agreement remains the cornerstone of global climate governance, mandating nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to limit temperature rise to 1.5–2°C[2][9]. As of 2025, 192 parties have ratified the agreement, though inconsistent compliance and withdrawal by major emitters like the U.S. under the Trump administration highlight governance vulnerabilities[2]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes that global CO2 emissions must decline by 48% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050–2060 to avoid catastrophic warming[8][10]. The European Union’s binding target of reducing emissions 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 exemplifies regional ambition, leveraging 3,000 policies spanning renewable energy mandates, building efficiency standards, and sustainable land use[1][15]. However, the EU’s 6% share of global emissions underscores the imperative for broader international collaboration[1].  

### Mechanisms for Global Equity and Climate Finance  
Developed economies face ethical and practical obligations to support decarbonization in low-income nations, which often bear disproportionate climate impacts. Initiatives like Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) mobilize $130 billion in climate financing to assist countries like South Africa and Indonesia in phasing out coal while ensuring socioeconomic stability[15]. The EU’s Green Alliances foster technology transfer and policy alignment with partners in Latin America and Africa, prioritizing climate resilience and biodiversity conservation alongside emission reductions[15]. These frameworks aim to address historical inequities in energy access while mitigating the geopolitical risks of uncoordinated action.  

## Transitioning to Renewable Energy Systems  

### Scalability of Solar and Wind Power  
Solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind now provide the lowest-cost electricity generation in most regions, with levelized costs falling 85% and 55% respectively since 2010[3][4]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that renewable capacity must expand six-fold by 2040 to meet net-zero targets, necessitating annual investments exceeding $4 trillion[11]. Hybrid systems integrating offshore wind farms and grid-scale battery storage can mitigate intermittency, while green hydrogen offers a pathway to decarbonize heavy industry and aviation[3][11]. For example, EcoFlow’s modular solar systems demonstrate how decentralized energy solutions can reduce household reliance on fossil fuels by 80%, particularly in regions with unreliable grid infrastructure[4].  

### Phasing Out Fossil Fuel Dependence  
Despite renewable advancements, fossil fuels still account for 79% of global primary energy consumption[12]. Accelerating the phaseout requires carbon pricing regimes, subsidies redirected toward clean energy, and stringent methane regulations. The Climate Action Tracker estimates that current policies would result in 2.7°C warming by 2100, largely due to ongoing coal and gas extraction[7][13]. Countries like Norway and Canada face structural challenges in aligning petroleum economies with climate goals, highlighting the need for just transition policies to retrain workers and diversify regional economies[6][15].  

## Enhancing Natural Carbon Sinks  

### Afforestation and Agroforestry  
Terrestrial ecosystems currently absorb 29% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but deforestation and land degradation diminish this capacity[14]. Large-scale reforestation could sequester 4.2–7.4 GtCO2 annually, with tropical regions offering the highest cost-effectiveness[5][14]. Brazil’s Amazon reforestation initiatives, which integrate cacao and coffee agroforestry, restore degraded pastures while providing livelihood alternatives to slash-and-burn practices[5]. Similarly, Europe’s LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) regulation incentivizes carbon farming practices, such as cover cropping and reduced tillage, to enhance soil organic carbon[14].  

### Blue Carbon and Coastal Restoration  
Mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows store carbon at densities 4–10 times higher than terrestrial forests, yet these ecosystems are disappearing at rates up to 2% annually[12]. Projects like Mozambique’s mangrove restoration not only sequester CO2 but also buffer coastal communities from storm surges exacerbated by sea-level rise. The IPCC advocates for integrating blue carbon credits into international climate finance mechanisms, though challenges persist in standardizing measurement and preventing “carbon leakage”[14].  

## Technological Innovations and Controversial Solutions  

### Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)  
While renewable deployment remains the priority, CCUS is critical for hard-to-abate sectors like cement and steel production. The IEA’s Net Zero Scenario requires CCUS capacity to expand 120-fold by 2050, capturing 7.6 GtCO2 annually[11][13]. Norway’s Northern Lights project, which injects CO2 into offshore saline aquifers, demonstrates technical feasibility, though costs remain prohibitive at $80–120 per ton without subsidies[13]. Direct air capture (DAC) technologies, such as Climeworks’ Orca plant in Iceland, show promise but face energy-intensity hurdles, requiring 2,000 kWh per ton of CO2 removed[12][13].  

### Solar Radiation Management and Geoengineering  
Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) could temporarily offset warming by reflecting sunlight, mimicking the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions. Models suggest deploying 10–20 million tons of sulfur dioxide annually could reduce global temperatures by 1°C, yet risks include disrupted monsoon patterns and ozone depletion[12]. Marine cloud brightening, which enhances cloud reflectivity by spraying seawater aerosols, is being tested in the Great Barrier Reef to mitigate coral bleaching[12]. These technologies provoke ethical debates over unilateral deployment and moral hazard, potentially disincentivizing emission reductions[12].  

## Individual and Collective Action  

### Household-Level Mitigation Strategies  
Residential energy use accounts for 17% of global emissions, underscoring the role of behavioral changes. Retrofitting buildings with insulation and heat pumps can reduce heating emissions by 75%, while shifting to plant-based diets lowers food-related footprints by 40–70%[6][7]. Digital tools like the MIT Climate Primer enable individuals to calculate personalized mitigation pathways, though systemic policy changes remain paramount[6].  

### Corporate Accountability and Supply Chain Decarbonization  
The Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has certified 3,000 companies committed to net-zero supply chains, including Microsoft’s pledge to remove all historical emissions by 2050[10]. However, greenwashing persists, with 60% of corporate net-zero plans relying on questionable offsets rather than direct emission cuts[13]. Strengthening mandatory disclosure standards, as proposed by the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), can enhance transparency and align investments with 1.5°C pathways[15].  

## Conclusion  

Halting climate change demands an unprecedented restructuring of energy, agricultural, and financial systems within a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity. While renewable energy deployment and forest restoration offer the most immediate gains, achieving net-zero by mid-century will require supplementing these efforts with carbon removal technologies and reformed governance models. The EU’s experience illustrates the viability of binding sectoral targets, yet global equity must underpin all strategies to prevent destabilizing inequalities. As the 2025 UN Climate Summit approaches, nations must elevate ambition in revised NDCs, prioritizing just transitions that harmonize ecological integrity with human development. Failure to act decisively in this decade will irrevocably compromise the planet’s capacity to sustain civilization as we know it.
