Okay, so I need to figure out to what extent conservatives agree on society. Let's start by breaking down the key aspects of conservative thought related to society based on the search results provided.

First, looking at [1] and [2], conservatism in the U.S. and generally emphasizes traditional institutions, moral values, and limited government. There's a focus on individualism, tradition, and a belief in human imperfection. However, sources like [5] and [8] mention divisions between traditional conservatives and modern or fiscal conservatives, especially regarding the role of the state. Traditional conservatives like Burke and Hobbes support a more active state to maintain order, whereas the New Right (Nozick, Rand) argue for minimal state intervention.

Then, considering social issues from [1], conservatives largely agree on opposing abortion, euthanasia, and certain LGBT rights, promoting Christian values. But [3] and [4] point out that liberals and conservatives perceive consensus differently; conservatives tend to overestimate intra-group consensus. This might affect how unified they appear on societal issues.

From [6], conservatives reject radical social changes and favor tradition over abstract rationalism. But [7] and [12] discuss factions within the Republican Party, like the Freedom Caucus, indicating internal disagreements. For example, on environmental policies, some conservatives oppose climate change measures, as noted in [11] and [16], which also show that presenting consensus can bridge divides.

Looking at [9] and [10], there's a tension between desiring national unity and fearing subordination to liberal values. Conservatives prioritize preserving traditional social structures, as in [15], which talks about organic society and national unity. However, [14] notes disagreements on state intervention in society between traditional and New Right conservatives.

In summary, conservatives agree on foundational principles like tradition, moral absolutism, and skepticism of rapid change. However, they diverge on the state's role, economic policies, and responses to modern issues like climate change. The extent of agreement varies by issue, with more consensus on social values and more division on government's scope and specific policies.

# The Extent of Conservative Consensus on Society: An Analysis of Unity and Division  

Conservatism, as a political and social philosophy, is characterized by its emphasis on tradition, moral absolutism, and skepticism of radical change. However, the extent to which conservatives agree on societal organization and values remains a complex interplay of shared principles and ideological fractures. This report examines the areas of consensus and disagreement among conservatives, drawing on historical traditions, contemporary political dynamics, and psychological insights into ideological cohesion.

## Foundational Principles: Shared Beliefs in Tradition and Order  

### Organic Society and Human Imperfection  
Conservatives broadly agree on the concept of an **organic society**, viewing it as a naturally evolving entity shaped by customs, traditions, and shared historical experiences[1][2]. This perspective, rooted in the works of Edmund Burke and Michael Oakeshott, posits that society cannot be redesigned through abstract rationalism but must instead grow organically[6][15]. For instance, Burke argued that societal institutions are “the accumulated wisdom of generations,” providing stability in the face of human imperfection[2][8]. The conservative emphasis on **human fallibility**—the belief that individuals are intellectually and morally limited—reinforces the need for structured institutions to mitigate chaos[6][8].  

This shared view manifests in a consensus on the importance of **law and order**, as exemplified by Thomas Hobbes’s social contract theory, which asserts that a sovereign authority is necessary to prevent a “war of all against all”[14][15]. Both traditional and one-nation conservatives endorse this framework, albeit with varying degrees of state intervention[5][8].  

### Moral Absolutism and Social Cohesion  
Moral absolutism forms another pillar of conservative unity. Conservatives typically advocate for **Christian values**, traditional family structures, and opposition to policies perceived as undermining these norms, such as abortion rights, euthanasia, and expansive LGBTQ+ protections[1][7]. This moral framework is seen as essential for maintaining social cohesion and national identity[15]. For example, the emphasis on **American exceptionalism** and Western cultural preservation reflects a desire to uphold a distinct societal ethos against perceived threats from moral relativism or multiculturalism[1][7].

## Divisions on the Role of the State and Economic Policy  

### Traditional vs. Libertarian Conservatism  
While conservatives agree on the need for societal stability, they diverge sharply on the **role of the state**. Traditional conservatives, influenced by Burke and Hobbes, support a state that actively preserves order through paternalistic measures[5][14]. In contrast, the New Right—exemplified by Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand—advocates for minimal state intervention, prioritizing individual liberty and free-market capitalism[5][7]. Nozick’s assertion that “taxation is theft” highlights this libertarian streak, which rejects collective welfare programs in favor of self-ownership[5][14].  

This divide is evident in debates over **economic policy**. Traditional conservatives accept limited state intervention to cushion market excesses, as seen in Benjamin Disraeli’s one-nation conservatism[8]. Conversely, modern fiscal conservatives oppose welfare expansions, arguing that free markets naturally optimize societal outcomes[7][12]. The tension between these factions has shaped Republican Party dynamics, with groups like the Freedom Caucus pushing for austerity and deregulation[12].  

### Environmental and Scientific Controversies  
Disagreements extend to **climate change** and scientific consensus. While mainstream conservatives increasingly acknowledge environmental challenges, a significant faction remains skeptical of anthropogenic climate change, framing it as a pretext for government overreach[7][11]. Psychological studies reveal that conservatives perceive greater intra-group consensus than actually exists, exacerbating resistance to policies like carbon taxation[3][4][16]. However, framing climate action as a **social consensus**—e.g., highlighting 97% scientist agreement—can mitigate polarization, suggesting that perceived unity influences policy receptivity[11][16].

## Cultural and Ideological Tensions  

### Identity Politics vs. Individualism  
Conservatives uniformly reject **identity politics**, which they associate with divisive multiculturalism[1][15]. Instead, they promote **individualism** and colorblind policies, opposing affirmative action and reparations as contrary to meritocracy[1][7]. This stance aligns with the conservative view that societal harmony arises from shared values rather than group-based entitlements[15]. However, this principle clashes with efforts to address systemic inequities, revealing a tension between abstract ideals and pragmatic governance.  

### Nationalism and Social Unity  
**National conservatism** has emerged as a unifying force, particularly under figures like Donald Trump, who emphasize border security, cultural preservation, and skepticism of globalism[7][15]. The “Make America Great Again” agenda reflects a nostalgia for perceived societal unity, contrasting with progressive visions of demographic and cultural pluralism[15]. Yet, this nationalism often conflicts with libertarian priorities, such as free trade and military non-intervention[7][12].

## Psychological and Perceptual Factors  

### The Illusion of Consensus  
Research indicates that conservatives **overestimate intra-group consensus**, fostering a false sense of unity[3][4][13]. For example, studies show that conservatives perceive greater agreement on non-political issues like climate change than liberals, even when actual consensus is lacking[13][16]. This “desire to share reality” reinforces collective identity but may impede pragmatic compromise[4][13]. Conversely, liberals underestimate their own consensus, leading to fragmented advocacy[3].

## Conclusion: A Coalition of Paradoxes  

Conservatives share a core commitment to tradition, moral order, and organic societal development. These principles create a foundational unity, particularly on social issues and national identity. However, ideological fractures persist over the state’s role, economic policy, and responses to scientific challenges. The conservative movement’s strength lies in its ability to balance these tensions, leveraging perceived consensus to mobilize support while navigating internal diversity. As societal issues grow increasingly complex, the challenge for conservatives will be to reconcile their reverence for tradition with the demands of a rapidly changing world.  

**Future trajectories** may hinge on bridging the gap between traditional paternalism and libertarian individualism, particularly on issues like healthcare and climate change. Additionally, addressing perceptual biases—such as overestimating consensus—could enhance policy coherence. For now, conservatism remains a coalition united by shared values but tested by the practical realities of governance.
