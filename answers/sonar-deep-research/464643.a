Okay, I need to write a comprehensive report on how Gatsby represents the American Dream in The Great Gatsby. Let me start by reviewing the search results provided.

From the sources, I see several key points. The American Dream is traditionally about hard work leading to success, but in the 1920s, it became corrupted by materialism. Gatsby's character embodies both the original dream and its corruption. His wealth, acquired through shady means, shows the shift from hard work to get-rich-quick schemes. Yet, his motivation is love for Daisy, which adds complexity.

The green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a symbol of hope and the elusive nature of the Dream. Gatsby's relentless pursuit of Daisy, despite her being married, mirrors the endless chasing of the Dream. His parties and lavish lifestyle represent the materialism of the era, contrasting with the emptiness he feels.

The valley of ashes symbolizes the decay beneath the surface of wealth, indicating the failure of the Dream for many. Gatsby's death at the end underscores the ultimate unattainability of the Dream, as his wealth and efforts couldn't secure happiness or acceptance.

I should structure the report into sections: introduction, historical context of the American Dream, Gatsby's embodiment of both the ideal and corruption, symbolism like the green light and valley of ashes, the role of materialism, and the conclusion about the Dream's failure. Each section needs detailed analysis with citations from the sources provided. Make sure to avoid lists and use flowing paragraphs with proper headers. Need to ensure all key points from the sources are covered and cited correctly.

# The Embodiment and Corruption of the American Dream in *The Great Gatsby*  

F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* stands as a seminal critique of the American Dream, exploring its transformation from a collective aspiration for self-improvement and equality into a hollow pursuit of materialism and social status. At the heart of this exploration is Jay Gatsby, a figure who simultaneously embodies the idealism and corruption of this national ethos. Gatsby’s relentless pursuit of wealth and love reflects the duality of the American Dream—its capacity to inspire grand ambitions while perpetuating cycles of disillusionment. Through Gatsby’s tragic arc, Fitzgerald reveals the inherent contradictions of a society that equates success with moral compromise, ultimately arguing that the Dream’s promise of reinvention and fulfillment remains perpetually out of reach.  

## Historical Context of the American Dream  

The American Dream, as conceptualized in the early 20th century, promised upward mobility and self-determination regardless of one’s origins. Rooted in the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, it emphasized “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness” as universal rights[5]. This vision attracted immigrants and fueled the ambitions of individuals like James Gatz, who reinvented himself as Jay Gatsby. However, the 1920s marked a shift in the Dream’s meaning, as postwar prosperity and consumer culture prioritized wealth accumulation over moral integrity[2][5]. The era’s excesses, exemplified by Gatsby’s opulent parties, underscored a growing disconnect between the Dream’s egalitarian roots and its materialistic reinterpretation. Fitzgerald situates Gatsby’s story within this historical pivot, using his protagonist to interrogate the costs of conflating financial success with personal fulfillment.  

### The Evolution of the Dream in the Jazz Age  
The Jazz Age redefined the American Dream as a pursuit of immediate gratification rather than long-term stability. Characters like Tom and Daisy Buchanan epitomize the hereditary elite who inherit wealth without effort, while Gatsby represents the “nouveau riche” who claw their way into high society through dubious means[1][6]. This dichotomy highlights the era’s tension between old and new money, revealing how the Dream became inaccessible to those without preexisting social capital. Gatsby’s lavish lifestyle, funded by bootlegging and other criminal activities, underscores the moral decay required to achieve rapid upward mobility[2][5]. Fitzgerald thus critiques a society where success is measured not by character but by the ability to project an image of prosperity.  

## Gatsby as the Embodiment of the American Dream  

Jay Gatsby embodies the American Dream’s aspirational core, driven by an “extraordinary gift for hope” and a belief in self-reinvention[7][8]. Born into rural poverty, Gatsby transforms himself through sheer willpower, adopting the habits and aesthetics of the wealthy to win the love of Daisy Buchanan. His meticulous self-creation—from his fabricated Oxford education to his grandiose mansion—mirrors the Dream’s promise that anyone can transcend their circumstances[6][7]. Yet this reinvention is inherently performative, masking the insecurity of a man who remains perpetually estranged from the elite world he covets. Gatsby’s parties, attended by strangers drawn to his wealth rather than his personhood, symbolize the emptiness of social validation acquired through materialism[1][2].  

### The Paradox of Gatsby’s Ambition  
Gatsby’s tragedy lies in his inability to reconcile his idealized vision of the Dream with its reality. His pursuit of Daisy, whom he associates with the wealth and status he lacked in youth, becomes a metaphor for the unattainable nature of the Dream itself[3][4]. The green light at the end of her dock, a recurring symbol in the novel, represents both Gatsby’s hope and the illusory quality of his aspirations. Nick Carraway observes Gatsby stretching his arms toward the light “in a curious way,” a gesture that encapsulates the yearning and futility underlying his quest[4][6]. Despite amassing wealth, Gatsby cannot bridge the gap between his past and present, revealing the Dream’s failure to deliver true belonging or identity.  

## Symbolism and the Corrupted Dream  

Fitzgerald employs rich symbolism to illustrate the American Dream’s corruption, with Gatsby’s arc serving as a microcosm of broader societal decay. The Valley of Ashes, a desolate wasteland overshadowed by billboards of watchful eyes, epitomizes the moral and environmental degradation wrought by unchecked capitalism[4][5]. Here, the working class—embodied by George Wilson—toils in obscurity, their dreams stifled by the same system that elevates figures like Gatsby. The eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, looming over the valley, evoke a godless universe where materialism replaces spiritual fulfillment, further underscoring the Dream’s hollow core[4][8].  

### The Green Light and the Illusion of Hope  
The green light, situated at the end of Daisy’s dock, symbolizes the paradoxical nature of the American Dream: perpetually visible yet eternally unattainable. Gatsby’s fixation on the light reflects his belief that wealth can recapture the past and secure a future with Daisy[3][4]. However, Fitzgerald subverts this symbolism in the novel’s closing pages, as Nick reflects that Gatsby’s dream “was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city”[4][7]. The light’s diminishing glow mirrors the fading promise of the Dream, suggesting that its pursuit often leads to nostalgia rather than progress.  

## Materialism and the Erosion of Moral Values  

Gatsby’s rise to wealth exemplifies the moral compromises required to achieve the American Dream in the 1920s. His association with figures like Meyer Wolfsheim, a gangster involved in rigged elections and illicit activities, highlights the era’s blurring of legality and ambition[2][5]. While Gatsby’s criminal endeavors enable his social ascent, they also isolate him from genuine human connection, reducing his relationships to transactions. Daisy’s eventual rejection of Gatsby—choosing Tom’s inherited wealth over his ill-gotten fortune—reveals the entrenched class biases that undermine the Dream’s egalitarian ideals[1][6]. Fitzgerald thus critiques a society that rewards corruption while denying entry to those who lack pedigree.  

### The Hollow Victories of the Nouveau Riche  
Gatsby’s parties, though spectacular, serve as a facade for his inner loneliness. Guests flock to his mansion for entertainment and alcohol but remain indifferent to his true identity, reflecting the superficiality of Jazz Age social circles[1][7]. This dissonance between public image and private reality mirrors the broader cultural obsession with appearances over substance. Even Gatsby’s love for Daisy is rooted in illusion; he idealizes her as a symbol of success rather than acknowledging her flaws. Her voice, described as “full of money,” underscores the entanglement of romance and materialism, revealing how the Dream corrupts even the most intimate human desires[6][8].  

## The Inevitability of Failure  

Gatsby’s death, precipitated by his unwavering belief in the Dream, serves as the novel’s tragic denouement. Abandoned by Daisy and scapegoated for Myrtle Wilson’s death, Gatsby becomes a casualty of the very system he sought to conquer[4][5]. His funeral, attended only by Nick and a handful of others, starkly contrasts with the crowds at his parties, symbolizing the fleeting nature of wealth-driven alliances. Fitzgerald uses this outcome to argue that the American Dream, when reduced to materialism, is inherently unsustainable. Gatsby’s fate reflects the broader disillusionment of a generation that pursued prosperity at the expense of moral and emotional fulfillment.  

### The Legacy of the American Dream  
In the novel’s final pages, Nick likens Gatsby’s hope to the “orgiastic future” that recedes with each generation, a metaphor for the Dream’s perpetual elusiveness[4][7]. The closing image of boats “borne back ceaselessly into the past” suggests that progress is an illusion, and that the pursuit of the Dream often traps individuals in cycles of repetition and regret[8]. Fitzgerald’s critique extends beyond Gatsby to indict a national ethos that prioritizes individual ambition over collective responsibility, leaving little room for genuine human connection or redemption.  

## Conclusion  

*The Great Gatsby* remains a profound meditation on the American Dream’s promises and pitfalls. Through Gatsby’s story, Fitzgerald exposes the contradictions of a society that equates success with moral compromise and material excess. The novel challenges readers to reconsider the Dream’s viability in a world where wealth and status overshadow integrity and love. While Gatsby’s “extraordinary gift for hope” embodies the Dream’s aspirational core, his tragic undoing reveals the cost of conflating reinvention with self-delusion[7][8]. In the end, Fitzgerald’s work serves as both a eulogy for the corrupted Dream and a cautionary tale about the dangers of mistaking opulence for fulfillment.
