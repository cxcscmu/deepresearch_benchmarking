### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Numerous studies highlight key reasons leading to startup failures:

- **Lack of Market Need**: Startups often fail because they create products that do not meet consumer demands or validate market needs through research. Many entrepreneurs pursue ideas based on personal passion rather than market viability.

- **Running Out of Cash**: Financial mismanagement, underestimating costs, or failure to secure funding can lead to cash flow problems. This is a critical concern for startups as they often run out of financial resources before becoming profitable.

- **Inadequate Team**: A lack of experience, cohesion, or necessary skills can result in poor team dynamics that hinder operational efficiency and ability to adapt.

- **Strong Competition**: Entering a market without a clear differentiation strategy can lead startups to lose out to existing competitors or emerging players. Failure to monitor rivals can leave startups unprepared for market challenges.

- **Faulty Business Model**: An unviable business model or poor pricing strategy can lead to confusion regarding monetization, hindering sustainability.

- **Ignoring Customer Feedback**: After launching a product, many startups neglect customer feedback, which often results in products not aligning with real user needs and low adoption rates.

- **Ineffective Marketing**: Great products fail due to poorly executed marketing strategies that miss reaching the target audience, leading to low visibility.

- **Poor Product Management**: Many startups struggle with product quality issues, such as bugs or poor user experience, impeding user growth.

- **Poor Market Timing**: Launching a product at the wrong time can severely limit consumer interest and adoption rates.

- **Regulatory Challenges**: Non-compliance with legal requirements can lead to fines and hamper business credibility, emphasizing the need for understanding regulatory landscapes.
