### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The findings indicate a generally positive impact of specific interventions on the mental well-being of users, particularly concerning depression. Therapy-based interventions were found to be more effective than simply limiting or abstaining from social media use.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The systematic review synthesized literature on the effectiveness of social media use interventions aimed at improving mental well-being in adults. Among the 2785 studies identified, only 23 were included in the final analysis. The findings revealed that 39% of these studies showed improvements in mental well-being, while 30% reported mixed effects and another 30% showed no effects at all. Notably, therapy-based interventions utilizing techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy yielded the highest effectiveness, with 83% of such studies demonstrating significant improvements in mental well-being compared to only 20% of studies that focused on limiting social media use and 25% of studies that involved complete abstinence. Depression was the most frequently assessed outcome, and 70% of studies reported significant improvements in depression following the interventions. However, the overall quality of evidence was poor, with 96% of studies rated as weak in quality, primarily due to selection biases stemming from the heavy reliance on convenience sampling, particularly among university students. The review concludes that while social media use interventions can help enhance mental well-being, especially concerning depression, further high-quality, longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the nuances of these interventions and to inform policymakers and clinicians on effective strategies.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The document is a systematic review aimed at assessing the impact of various interventions targeting social media use on mental well-being, particularly within adult populations. It addresses the concerns around excessive social media use and its association with negative mental health outcomes. The review draws attention to the necessity for more robust experimental research with diverse and representative participant samples, which would aid in formulating recommendations for managing social media use effectively. As social media continues to play a significant role in everyday life, understanding its effects on mental health remains critically relevant for individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers.
