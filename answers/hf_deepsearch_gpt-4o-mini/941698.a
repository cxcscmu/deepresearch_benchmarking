Perception varies from individual to individual due to a blend of psychological, cultural, social, and experiential factors. Cognitive biases influenced by cultural contexts significantly impact how individuals perceive situations, while societal norms and past experiences shape interpretations. Understanding these mechanisms is critical in various domains such as psychology, decision-making, and environmental policy.
