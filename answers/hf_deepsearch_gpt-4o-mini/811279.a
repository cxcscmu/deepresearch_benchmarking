The question of whether private citizens should be allowed to own a gun is complex. Current laws provide a framework for ownership, but statistics on gun violence, including around 40,000 deaths in 2023, highlight significant public safety concerns. While ownership may enhance personal security for some, it also carries risks associated with suicides and gun violence, suggesting that regulations and safety measures could be imperative for minimizing harm. Thus, a balanced approach considering stricter regulations while respecting personal rights may be necessary.
