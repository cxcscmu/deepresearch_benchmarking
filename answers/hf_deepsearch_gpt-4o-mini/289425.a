### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The failure of the Reconstruction era (1865-1877) was primarily driven by white supremacy, government policy failures, and economic challenges, resulting in long-term detrimental effects on African Americans and race relations in the United States.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Reconstruction era, aimed at rebuilding the South and integrating freed slaves into society, ultimately failed due to several interrelated reasons:

1. **Violence and Terrorism:** White supremacist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, employed terrorism to undermine African American political participation and safety. The federal government struggled to protect the rights and lives of Black Americans, leading to widespread violence and intimidation.

2. **Policy Failures:** Many Reconstruction policies were poorly implemented and lacked the necessary military and financial support needed for meaningful change. The withdrawal of federal troops from the South in 1877 allowed Southern states to revert to oppressive laws, such as the Jim Crow laws, which institutionalized racial discrimination.

3. **Economic Challenges:** The Reconstruction government failed to effectively manage economic transitions for freedmen. Sharecropping systems were implemented, which often trapped African Americans in cycles of debt and poverty, hindering their economic progress.

4. **Political Opposition:** There was significant resistance from Southern whites and Conservative Democrats who sought to restore the antebellum status quo. This resulted in systematic disenfranchisement of Black voters and rebirth of oppressive State legislation.

5. **Lack of Consensus:** There was a deep national divide regarding race and economic policy, leading to inconsistent federal approaches and diminishing Northern support for Reconstruction efforts over time.

The consequences of these failures had profound impacts on American society, leading to a prolonged period of racial discrimination and conflict that persisted well into the 20th century, affecting civil rights movements and American political life profoundly.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The failure of Reconstruction set the stage for subsequent civil rights movements, as the struggles faced by African Americans during and after this era continued to influence social, political, and economic systems in America. The legacy of Reconstruction's failure is still felt in ongoing discussions about racial inequality and justice in modern society.
