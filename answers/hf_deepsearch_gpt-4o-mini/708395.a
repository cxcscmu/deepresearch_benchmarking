### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current statistics on the gender pay gap indicate that, as of 2023, women earned 83.6% of what men earned in median weekly earnings. The global gender gap in labor participation stands at 64.9% closed as per the latest reports.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2023, women who were full-time wage and salary workers had median weekly earnings of $1,005, which is 83.6% of the $1,202 median for men in the same category. This indicates a slight improvement from previous years, as the women’s-to-men’s earnings ratio has increased from 75% in 2000 to 83% in 2023. The report highlights that women had lower median weekly earnings than men across most major occupations.
- The Global Gender Gap Report 2023 by the World Economic Forum indicates that 68.4% of the gender gap in economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment has been closed globally. However, it notes that the labor-force participation gender gap is still notably significant, with only 64.9% closure. This means that there are ongoing challenges affecting women’s entry and maintenance in the workforce, reflected in wages and employment opportunities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The increasing awareness of the gender pay gap highlights the need for policy changes and initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality in pay and employment opportunities. The comparisons between national and global perspectives on the issue urge stakeholders to consider more inclusive practices to mitigate the disparities.
