### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The task explores how rentierism impacts state formation in the Middle East, particularly during times of war. Historical and contemporary case studies suggest that reliance on external rents can weaken state structures instead of reinforcing them through war-making.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
This analysis indicates that war in the Middle East often disrupts the expected path of state formation as outlined by Charles Tilly, where war-making is supposed to strengthen state capacity. Instead, many rentier states experience erosion of authority and increased fragility during conflicts. The interplay between rentierism—primarily through oil revenues—and warfare leads to unique challenges in state formation processes. In specific cases, such as Iraq and Syria, reliance on oil revenues has compounded issues of governance during conflicts, leading to heightened instability and social disparities.
Moreover, the literature reviewed across various academic sources supports the notion that these dynamics create a cycle of dependency that inhibits effective governance and fosters conflict, thereby reinforcing the difficulties of state-building efforts in the region.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Key studies, including those by Rolf Schwarz, highlight that while war can lead to state-building in some contexts, the particular economic and political structures of rentier states in the Middle East render them more susceptible to fragmentation during conflicts. This contrasts with traditional state-building theories, underscoring the need for further examination of socio-political frameworks within these countries.
