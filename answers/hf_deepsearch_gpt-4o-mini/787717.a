Abortion is legal in many jurisdictions due to a combination of legal, ethical, and health considerations. In the United States, abortion access varies significantly by state laws following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, with some states imposing total bans while others maintain protections. In Canada, abortion has been legal since 1988 and is publicly funded, although access challenges remain a concern. In the European Union, most member states allow abortion on broad social grounds, showing a trend towards liberalization despite some states maintaining restrictive laws. Overall, the legality of abortion centers on women's rights, societal health standards, and ongoing advocacy for reproductive rights.
