### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Nurses spend approximately 27% of their time on electronic health record (EHR) documentation, reflecting a significant portion of their workload.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
A thorough analysis revealed that nurses in the emergency department spent a median of 27% of their working time on EHR tasks. This figure was determined using a time-and-motion methodology, which involved observing nurses' activities over a total of 46 hours. This percentage indicates that EHR-related tasks occupy a larger portion of their time compared to indirect patient care (15%), communication (6%), and personal time (17%), while being comparable to the direct patient care time of 25%. EHR usage has been identified as the most frequently performed task among the various activities evaluated in the study.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The findings are derived from a study titled "A Time and Motion Analysis of Nursing Workload and Electronic Health Record Use in the Emergency Department." This research employed a robust observational method to assess how emergency nurses utilized their time across different tasks, including clinical duties and EHR documentation. It highlights the challenges nurses face regarding workload and underscores the substantial time commitment to EHR documentation, which has implications for healthcare delivery and nurse burnout due to administrative burdens.
