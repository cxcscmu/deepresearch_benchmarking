Euthanasia, viewed through legal, ethical, statistical, and cultural lenses, presents a complex justification landscape. It is legal in many countries and supported by a significant majority of the public, indicating increasing acceptance.

As societal values evolve and legislation adapts, euthanasiaâ€™s justification continues to be a salient topic in medical ethics and public discourse.
