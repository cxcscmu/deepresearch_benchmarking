The debate over the reintroduction of the death penalty remains contentious, with profound implications for justice and human rights.

1. **Legal Status**: While the death penalty persists in countries like the U.S. and Japan, its application is heavily scrutinized due to increasing awareness of wrongful convictions. In Japan, despite public support over 80%, recent discussions reflect a growing recognition of potential injustices within the system.

2. **Public Sentiment**: In both countries, public opinion is shifting. U.S. support has dipped to the lowest levels in decades, while Japan's support remains high but faces challenges as wrongful convictions and exonerations raise ethical concerns.

3. **Arguments For**: Supporters posit that the death penalty deters crime, provides justice, and prevents reoffending. They emphasize the importance of a system that holds severe crimes accountable, reflecting societal values.

4. **Arguments Against**: Mistrust in the justice system due to documented wrongful convictions—185 in the U.S. and significant issues in Japan—challenges the ethical stance of the death penalty. Critics argue for the need for reforms protecting innocent lives over punishment, suggesting life sentences without parole as a more humane alternative.

In conclusion, weighing both arguments, the trend suggests a movement towards legal reform and potential abolition of the death penalty. Thus, the reintroduction of capital punishment could be counterproductive, damaging societal trust in justice systems and risking innocent lives.

Final conclusion recommendation: The death penalty should be avoided in favor of reforming justice systems to ensure fairness, equity, and protection of human rights without resorting to irreversible punitive measures like execution.
