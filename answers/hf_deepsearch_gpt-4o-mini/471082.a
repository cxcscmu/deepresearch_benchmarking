### Summary of Why Gas Prices are High:

1. **Current Gas Prices:** As of 2023, the average gas prices are:
   - United States: $3.52 per gallon, with a decline to $3.05 towards the year's end.  
   - Europe: Prices from €1.29 (Bulgaria) to €1.93 (Denmark) per liter in June 2023.  
   - Asia: Average around 0.86 USD/liter in China.

2. **Historical Trends:** Between 2020 and 2023, gas prices experienced significant fluctuations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recovering from $2.548 in January 2020, hitting peaks over $4 in June 2022, and stabilizing in the $3.3 to $3.8 range in early 2023.

3. **Oil Supply and Demand Dynamics:** In 2023, OPEC's crude oil production decreased by about 20% from 34 mb/d to approximately 27 mb/d. Meanwhile, global oil demand reached an all-time high of around 102.2 mb/d. This mismatch between reducing supply and increasing demand pressures further escalates prices at the pump.

4. **Geopolitical Influences:** Geopolitical events, including the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East, have heightened market volatility. For instance, oil prices surged about 4% after terrorist incidents in Israel in October 2023, reflecting how geopolitical tensions directly impact oil pricing and availability.

5. **Uncertainties Ahead:** The interplay of decreasing supply from OPEC and rising demand amidst political instability adds a layer of complexity to forecasting gas prices. Experts believe that such geopolitical risks will persist and continue to affect oil pricing in the foreseeable future.
