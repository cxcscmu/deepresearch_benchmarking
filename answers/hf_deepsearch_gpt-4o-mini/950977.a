### Causes of World War I:

1. **Militarism**: 
   - The aggressive buildup of military forces was especially evident in the Anglo-German naval race, where Germany aimed to expand its navy to rival Britain’s maritime supremacy, leading to elevated tensions.

2. **Alliances**:
   - A complex web of alliances, including the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia), meant that a conflict involving one nation could swiftly escalate into a larger war.
  
3. **Imperialism**: 
   - European powers aggressively expanded their empires in Africa and Asia, creating rivalries that increased tensions and conflict potential.
   
4. **Nationalism**: 
   - Ethnic groups sought self-determination; notably, Serbian nationalism, which led to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, acting as a trigger for war.

### Consequences of World War I:

1. **Social Impacts**:
   - **Changes in Gender Roles**: Women entered the workforce more prominently, contributing to the suffrage movement.
   - **Altered Class Structures**: Disruption in class hierarchies fostered increased respect for laborers.
   - **Mental Health Awareness**: The psychological toll on soldiers led to greater public recognition of mental health issues.
   - **Cultural Shift**: Literature and art reacted to war’s absurdity and trauma, paving the way for Modernism.

2. **Political Impacts**:
   - **Collapse of Empires**: Major empires fell, leading to the formation of new nations and altered political boundaries.
   - **Treaty of Versailles**: Imposed punitive measures on Germany, inciting national humiliation and future conflicts, notably contributing to World War II.
   - **Rise of New Political Ideologies**: Communism and fascism gained traction post-war, particularly in Russia following the Bolshevik Revolution.

3. **Economic Impacts**:
   - **Post-War Recession**: Economic turmoil plagued Europe while the U.S. experienced a brief growth followed by the 1919 recession.
   - **Hyperinflation**: Germany faced extreme hyperinflation in the 1920s due to war reparations.
   - **Global Economic Shift**: The war marked a transition of economic power from Europe to the U.S.

### Additional Context:
The interplay of these causes and consequences not only influenced the immediate post-war period but also shaped future global dynamics. Understanding these events is crucial for comprehending the socio-political landscape of the 20th century and beyond.
