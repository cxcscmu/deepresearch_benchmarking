My view on globalisation and sustainable development is that they are interconnected processes that can both complement and conflict with each other. On one hand, globalisation facilitates the exchange of ideas, technologies, and resources across borders, which can lead to innovative solutions for sustainable development challenges. For example, sharing best practices in renewable energy can help reduce carbon footprints globally.

However, globalisation can also exacerbate inequalities and environmental degradation if not managed sustainably. The pursuit of economic growth often leads to over-exploitation of natural resources and neglect of social equity. Therefore, it is essential to implement policies that ensure globalisation promotes sustainable practices, such as prioritising fair trade, environmental protection, and community engagement in decision-making processes.

Ultimately, achieving sustainable development requires a balanced approach that harnesses the advantages of globalisation while mitigating its negative consequences, ensuring that both current and future generations can thrive.
