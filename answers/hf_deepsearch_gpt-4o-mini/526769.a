{'short_version': 'Globalization is redistributing power dynamics by partially denationalizing state functions, altering citizenship definitions, creating new channels for citizen engagement, and empowering non-state actors, leading to a blurring of traditional state authority.', 'detailed_version': ' \n    Globalization is fundamentally reshaping the interactions between states and citizens through several mechanisms, including:\n    \n    1. **Denationalization of State Functions**: Globalization intertwines certain state responsibilities with global norms, altering traditional authority.\n    2. **Emergence of New Channels for Citizen Engagement**: Citizens now have opportunities to participate in global governance, demanding accountability from global actors.\n    3. **Transformation of Citizenship**: The traditional concept of citizenship is declining as individuals navigate both national and transnational identities.\n    4. **Challenges with Inequality**: Power shifts do not benefit all citizens equally, leading to deeper inequalities.\n    5. **Conflicts with National Sovereignty**: Globalization may weaken state power while increasing the complexity of governance dynamics.\n    6. **Non-State Actor Empowerment**: NGOs and international organizations allow citizens to engage outside state structures, diversifying agency.\n    \n    These points illustrate how, while globalization creates new avenues for citizen engagement, it simultaneously presents challenges related to rights, resources, and traditional state authority.', 'additional_context': 'This analysis considers globalization as a multi-scalar process that reshapes power relations, offering both opportunities and threats to citizen agency.'}
