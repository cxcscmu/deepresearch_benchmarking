### Comprehensive Summary on Why More Men Commit Crimes than Women:

1. **Statistical Overview**: 
   - In 2023, approximately 6.4 million violent victimizations were reported, with men constituting the majority of victims. The rate of violent victimization for men was 6.9 per 1,000 while for women, it was reported traditionally lower. 
   - Males showed higher rates in violent crime transactions, with males accounting for 14,327 murder offenders compared to 1,898 females.

2. **Sociological Factors**: 
   - Men are socialized to adopt more aggressive roles, leading to higher crime rates. This is rooted in societal expectations where aggressive behaviors are more frequently encouraged, while women are typically expected to have nurturing and compliant characteristics.
   - The disparity in crime commission aligns with gender roles and agency, where moral expectations differ significantly between genders.

3. **Psychological Theories of Aggression**: 
   - Aggression arises from several psychological approaches including instinctual, reactive, learning, and cognitive factors. Males exhibit higher rates of violent behavior partly due to these learned and inherent aggressiveness, compared to females who develop better social cognition skills that help manage stress without resorting to aggression.

4. **Societal Perceptions in the Legal System**: 
   - Societal perceptions influence sentencing and crime policy. Women are often perceived as less culpable, leading to shorter sentences even for similar crimes. In 2023, female offenders received sentences approximately 29.2% shorter than male offenders due to prevailing stereotypes.
   - These perceptions can contribute to systemic biases that affect how crimes are prosecuted and punished.

5. **Conclusions**: 
   - The convergence of societal norms, psychological predispositions, and statistical data illustrates the higher prevalence of crime among men compared to women. Interventions focused on positive socialization and cognitive behavioral strategies targeting males may help reduce crime rates.

This holistic understanding illustrates the complexity of gender differences in crime and provides a comprehensive view on how effective policies can be developed to address and mitigate these disparities.
