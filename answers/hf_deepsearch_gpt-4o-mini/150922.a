People believe in fake news due to a combination of psychological influences, demographic factors, and the dynamics of social media. Emotional responses and cognitive biases lead individuals to favor sensational or confirming information. Age, education, and gender significantly impact susceptibility, with older adults often being more susceptible and women showing greater concern regarding misinformation. Political affiliation alters perceptions of news accuracy, resulting in partisan biases. Social media platforms amplify the spread of misinformation, breeding echo chambers that further entrench these beliefs. Notable case studies from major elections and public health crises illustrate the real-world implications of misinformation, highlighting the urgent need for media literacy and education to combat its effects.
