### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Socrates was a prominent ancient Greek philosopher known for his contributions to ethics and epistemology, notably the Socratic method. Born in 469 B.C.E. in Athens, he was foundational in the development of Western philosophy. He was condemned to death in 399 B.C.E. for impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens, leaving a legacy primarily through the accounts of his student Plato.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Socrates (469–399 B.C.E.) is often credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy. He was born to a stonemason in Athens and became known for his method of inquiry, later termed the "Socratic method," which involved asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. This method sought to engage others in self-reflection and examination of their beliefs.

His philosophical focus rested heavily on ethics, particularly on the concepts of virtue and the good life. Socrates believed that knowledge was intrinsically linked to ethical behavior; if one truly knew what was good, they would act accordingly. He famously asserted that "the unexamined life is not worth living,” highlighting the importance of self-awareness and moral introspection.

Socrates did not document his teachings. Most of what we understand about him comes from the dialogues written by his most illustrious student, Plato, who immortalized Socratic conversations about justice, virtue, piety, and the nature of knowledge. Socrates held discussions in public spaces, sharing his thoughts and challenging the status quo, which eventually led to conflicts with the Athenian authorities.

In 399 B.C.E., Socrates was tried on charges of corrupting the youth and impiety, specifically that he did not honor the city's gods. The trial is depicted in Plato's "Apology," where Socrates defended his philosophical pursuits. Rather than fleeing Athens when given the chance, Socrates chose to accept the sentence, famously declaring that a philosopher should not fear death.

He was sentenced to die by consuming hemlock, a deadly poison. His death marked the end of an era and underscored his teachings on virtue and ethics. Socrates' legacy endures through Plato and others who followed him, influencing countless philosophical thought and discourse throughout history.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Socrates’ impact stretches beyond philosophy into broader cultural realms, influencing perspectives on knowledge, ethics, and government. His conversations and teachings laid the groundwork for subsequent philosophers, such as Aristotle. His insistence on questioning assumptions fosters a critical approach in philosophy, education, and logic, rendering him a timeless figure in Western intellectual history.
