Euthanasia is a contentious issue with varied perspectives on its moral justification. Utilitarianism supports it for the relief of suffering and maximization of happiness, while Kantian ethics opposes it based on the principle of respecting human dignity and life. Virtue ethics introduces the character and intentions of individuals into the discussion, suggesting that euthanasia could be justified under compassionate circumstances. Therefore, the moral justification of euthanasia largely depends on the ethical viewpoint one adopts.
