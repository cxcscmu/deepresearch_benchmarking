1. **Social Acceptance**: In countries where divorce is legal, there is generally more acceptance of divorce as a necessary choice when relationships become unhealthy, creating a supportive environment for individuals to exit toxic marriages.

2. **Psychological Well-Being**: Legal avenues for divorce can lead to improved mental health outcomes. Escaping from a toxic or abusive relationship reduces emotional distress and allows for personal growth and renewal of self-identity.

3. **Economic Independence**: Legalizing divorce allows individuals, especially women, greater access to financial independence through asset division, spousal support, and increased employment opportunities. In contrast, prohibiting divorce contributes to economic dependency and creates cycles of poverty.

4. **Reduction of Stigma**: In places where divorce is illegal, such as the Philippines, individuals face social stigma and isolation, particularly women. Legalizing divorce could help reduce this stigma and promote healthier family structures.

5. **Child Welfare**: Divorce provides a pathway to stability for children who may be subjected to conflict or dysfunction in their homes. Legalizing divorce allows parents to make better choices for their children's well-being by aiming for healthier family dynamics.

6. **Cultural Shift**: Countries that legalize divorce often experience gradual cultural shifts toward valuing individual rights and emotional health, highlighting the importance of personal happiness and fulfillment within marriages.

In conclusion, legalizing divorce serves not just as a personal choice but as a vital societal mechanism that supports individual rights, mental health, economic stability, and healthier family structures overall. Reforming divorce laws may significantly enhance social justice by allowing individuals to escape from patently unhappy and unhealthy relationships.
