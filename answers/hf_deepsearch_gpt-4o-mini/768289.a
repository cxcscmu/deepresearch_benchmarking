### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The failure rate of sole traders in their first year typically ranges between 20% to 24.2%, with many businesses facing high failure rates overall, particularly in the first five years.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Sole traders, who operate as individual proprietors, encounter significant challenges in their first year of business. According to multiple studies, approximately **20% to 24.2%** of sole traders fail within their first year of operation. This statistic aligns with broader trends in small business failures; around **50% of all newly established businesses** fail within their first five years.

Factors contributing to the high failure rate include:
1. **Industry Variability**: Success rates can vary greatly across different industries. For instance, sole proprietors in finance and real estate may have higher survival rates compared to those in retail or construction.
2. **Capital Access**: Many sole traders face challenges in raising sufficient capital, which can hinder their operations and growth potential.
3. **Planning**: Effective business planning is vital. Poorly structured business plans can lead to high rates of failure.
4. **Skills and Experience**: The individualâ€™s skills and experience directly impact the likelihood of business success.
5. **Networking**: Building professional networks can provide valuable resources and opportunities that are essential for growth.

Compared to other business structures, sole proprietorships tend to have a higher rate of failure than partnerships and LLCs, primarily due to the lack of shared responsibility and resources in a sole proprietorship. Limited liability companies (LLCs), for example, benefit from shared capital and a corporate structure that may afford better legal protections and growth opportunities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The overall business climate and external economic factors, such as recessions or market disruptions, can exacerbate these failure rates. Additionally, ongoing education, network development, and financial planning are critical strategies that potential sole traders should adopt to enhance their chances of success.
