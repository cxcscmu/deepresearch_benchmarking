{'response': 'The interaction of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors in psychological disorders is complex and multifaceted. These factors continuously interrelate, influencing mental health outcomes and treatment approaches. Biological factors include genetic predispositions and neurochemical imbalances, while psychological factors encompass cognition and emotional regulation. Sociocultural influences highlight the role of societal stigma and community contexts.\n\nSpecific disorders like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia demonstrate how these factors synergistically contribute to the manifestation of mental health issues. Utilizing a biopsychosocial model enables more effective treatment strategies that are culturally sensitive and comprehensive.'}
