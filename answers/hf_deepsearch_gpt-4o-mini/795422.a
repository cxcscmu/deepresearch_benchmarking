### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Significant historical wars attributed to religion include the Crusades, the Thirty Years' War, the English Civil War, and the Lebanese Civil War. Each conflict involved religious factions vying for power, space, and influence, resulting in widespread violence and shifting power dynamics.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **The Crusades (1095-1291)**: A series of religious wars initiated by the Latin Church in the medieval period, primarily aimed at reclaiming Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule. The First Crusade was called by Pope Urban II, resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. Subsequent Crusades faced increased resistance and changing political landscapes, culminating in the fall of Acre in 1291, marking the end of Crusader presence in the region.

- **The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648)**: This conflict primarily involved various Protestant and Catholic states in what is now Germany. Originally a struggle between Protestant and Catholic factions, it evolved into a more complex political power struggle involving many European powers. The war ended with the Peace of Westphalia, leading to significant territorial changes and the recognition of the rights of different religious groups to coexist.

- **The English Civil War (1642-1651)**: This conflict emerged from tensions between the monarchy and Parliament, but religion played a crucial role, particularly the struggle between Anglican Royalists and the Parliamentary forces predominantly comprising Puritans. The outcome led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, highlighting the influence of religious ideology in political governance.

- **The Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990)**: A multifaceted civil war that involved various religious groups, including Christians and Muslims, alongside political factions. Tensions escalated due to socio-political inequality and foreign interventions, resulting in widespread violence and sectarian strife. The war ended with the Taif Agreement, which restructured political power distributions along sectarian lines.
