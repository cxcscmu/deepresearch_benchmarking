The appropriate balance between government and freedom in American democracy is one where the government, as defined by the Constitution, primarily exists to protect individual rights and maintain order. The Bill of Rights guarantees essential freedoms that must be upheld, as seen through landmark cases and civil rights legislation. This balance is dynamic, requiring continual vigilance to ensure that individual liberties remain protected against potential government overreach, reflecting ongoing needs for economic access and social justice.
