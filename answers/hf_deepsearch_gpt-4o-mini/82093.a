The Christian worldview posits that human problems arise fundamentally from sin, which separates humanity from God. To address these issues, Christianity emphasizes redemption through faith in Jesus Christ, who provides a pathway to reconciliation with God. 

Core solutions include:
1. **Grace and Forgiveness**: Central to healing are God's grace and the act of forgiveness that believers must extend to themselves and others.
2. **Love and Compassion**: Christians are called to express love towards God and their neighbors, promoting acts of kindness and support for those in need.

Additionally, suffering is viewed not merely as a hardship but as a transformative experience that can lead to spiritual growth. Churches often provide support systems to help individuals handle various challenges, advocating for social justice to address systemic issues.

In essence, Christianity offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing human problems through faith, community, and the practice of love and forgiveness.
