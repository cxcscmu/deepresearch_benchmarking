World War II was a global conflict (1939-1945) primarily caused by the rise of totalitarian regimes, the failure of the Treaty of Versailles, and the aggressive expansionist policies of Axis powers. Major events included the invasion of Poland, the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and D-Day. The war concluded with significant geopolitical shifts, including the creation of the United Nations and the emergence of the Cold War, resulting in an estimated 70-85 million deaths.

Judging this conflict through Just War Theory introduces complexity. This philosophical framework categorizes wars based on moral grounds, investigating just causes, proper conduct, and post-war peace. The predominant components of Just War Theory, known as Jus ad Bellum, Jus in Bello, and Jus post Bellum, provide nuanced guidelines for evaluating the war's justification.

Historically, the Allies' fight against fascism and totalitarianism adds a moral justification, as Axis powers committed serious human rights violations. However, discussions around the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki raise ethical concerns, questioning the morality of actions taken to conclude the war.

Despite its intention to defeat an aggressive aggressor, tactics employed, such as area bombing, pose dilemmas related to discrimination and proportionality.

Ultimately, historical interpretations and ethical considerations shape perspectives on whether WWII was justified. Scholars continue to debate the applicability of Just War Theory, and engage with contemporary conflicts to reassess such judgments in present contexts.
