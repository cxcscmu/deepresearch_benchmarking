The fairness of the criminal justice system is a deeply complex and contested issue. While it is ideally intended to ensure due process and equality for all, empirical evidence reveals significant disparities in areas such as policing, prosecution, and sentencingâ€”particularly across racial and socio-economic lines. Although reforms and ongoing efforts aim to correct these flaws, the persistence of systemic biases suggests that, in practice, the system often fails to achieve true fairness. Thus, the answer is neither a simple 'yes' nor 'no' but rather that the system, as it currently operates, remains fundamentally flawed in many parts despite its aspirational ideals.
