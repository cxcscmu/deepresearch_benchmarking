Long distance relationships often struggle because the lack of regular, face-to-face interaction limits the natural development of intimacy and emotional support. Without physical closeness, couples can experience communication breakdowns, misunderstandings, and diminished non-verbal cues, all of which are essential to building trust and resolving conflicts. Additionally, logistical challenges such as differing time zones, conflicting schedules, and the absence of spontaneous daily interactions contribute to feelings of isolation and disconnect. Over time, these factors may lead to unmet expectations and emotional strain, making it difficult to sustain the relationship in the long term.
