People often do not seek mental health treatment due to a combination of factors: the stigma associated with mental illness, which creates fear of judgment and discrimination; practical barriers such as high costs, limited availability of mental health providers, and logistical challenges; low mental health literacy that prevents individuals from recognizing symptoms and understanding that effective treatment exists; cultural and social norms that discourage discussing or acknowledging mental health issues; and personal factors including denial, fear of vulnerability, and mistrust in treatment. These interrelated factors create significant obstacles that prevent many from accessing the care they need.
