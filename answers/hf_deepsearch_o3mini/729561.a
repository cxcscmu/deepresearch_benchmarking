Social class significantly impacts education by shaping both the opportunities and the challenges that students face from early childhood through higher education. In research, 'social class' is typically measured by indicators such as family income, parental education, occupation, and the accumulation of cultural capital. These factors affect the type and quality of education that children receive. Students from higher social classes tend to benefit from enriched home environments, better-funded schools, and access to extracurricular and advanced educational opportunities. These advantages lead to higher academic achievement and wider social networks. Conversely, students from lower social classes often attend under-resourced schools with less experienced teachers, face limited access to academic support, and have fewer opportunities for enrichment, which can result in lower performance and perpetuate cycles of inequality. Understanding these dynamics has led to policy recommendations such as increasing investment in early childhood education, ensuring equitable school funding, and developing programs to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds, all aimed at reducing the pervasive effects of social class disparities in education.
