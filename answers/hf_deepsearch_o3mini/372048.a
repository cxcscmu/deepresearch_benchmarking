Data center power consumption causes a range of business and social problems. For businesses, the high energy requirements result in escalating operational costs, forcing companies to devote a significant portion of their budgets to electricity expenses. This can erode profit margins and make companies vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices. Moreover, the need for robust cooling systems and backup power supplies drives substantial capital investments. Such infrastructure demands can add to the complexity and risk of operating digital services, as power outages or inefficiencies can lead to disruptions in service and revenue losses.

On the social front, the enormous power consumption of data centers contributes heavily to environmental degradation. When the energy is sourced from fossil fuels, it leads to increased carbon emissions that exacerbate climate change and air pollution, affecting public health and the quality of life. Additionally, the large-scale demand for electricity can strain local power grids in communities where data centers are situated, potentially leading to higher energy costs and even outages for residents. This strain, coupled with environmental impacts, can raise issues of environmental justice, where the adverse effects are disproportionately experienced by local communities without equivalent benefits.
