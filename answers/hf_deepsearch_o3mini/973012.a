People may choose not to get vaccinated due to a complex mix of factors. Key reasons include concerns about vaccine safety and possible side effects, distrust of government, public health agencies, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as the influence of misinformation and conspiracy theories circulating on social media. Cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, along with a sense of complacency when the perceived risk of the disease is low, further contribute to their reluctance. Historical grievances and negative experiences with the medical system can also reinforce hesitancy. In summary, the decision not to vaccinate is often driven by a combination of safety fears, misinformation, mistrust, belief systems, and risk assessment.
