The challenges faced by the United Nations in maintaining global security are multifaceted. On one hand, there are structural and political challenges: the veto power held by the five permanent members of the Security Council often leads to political stalemates, and the divergent national interests of member states can impede unified action. On the other hand, operational challenges such as underfunded peacekeeping missions, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and slow mobilization of resources compromise effective intervention. Additionally, emerging threats—including terrorism, cyber warfare, nuclear proliferation, climate-induced conflicts, and pandemics—pose new challenges that the traditional UN framework is still adapting to. These internal limitations and the evolving nature of global threats combine to challenge the UN’s ability to secure sustained global peace.
