Language and culture are inextricably linked. Language is not only a tool for communication but also a system that shapes thought and influences cultural practices. The vocabulary, grammar, and idiomatic expressions within a language frame how its speakers perceive and categorize their experiences. This idea is exemplified by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which suggests that the structure of language influences cognitive processes. Beyond shaping thought, language serves as the primary medium for transmitting cultural values, traditions, and historical narratives. Through stories, proverbs, and idioms, language encapsulates shared experiences and morals, reinforcing group identity and social norms. Additionally, as culture evolves due to social, technological, and political influences, so too does languageâ€”reflecting and even catalyzing cultural change. In summary, language affects culture by both mirroring and molding the way individuals see the world and interact within their communities.
