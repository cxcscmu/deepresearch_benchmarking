Citizen journalism is neither inherently good nor bad; it is a double-edged sword. It can democratize access to information and provide fast, grassroots reporting, especially in contexts where traditional media may be absent or censored. However, its lack of formal editorial oversight and the potential for inaccuracies can lead to misinformation. Ultimately, the value of citizen journalism depends on how it is practiced and supported by effective fact-checking mechanisms.
