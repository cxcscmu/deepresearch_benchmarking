The 'war makes states' thesis emphasizes that military conflict catalyzed state formation by forcing rulers to develop centralized fiscal and administrative institutions. In the Middle East, however, many states have evolved as rentier states, relying heavily on external income from resources like oil rather than on domestic taxation derived from warfare. This reliance on rents often diminishes the coercive pressures that drive traditional state consolidation, meaning that while warfare may have historically contributed to state formation, the dominant contemporary force behind state organization in the region is rentierism.
