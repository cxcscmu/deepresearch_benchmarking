World War I was the result of a complex interplay of long-term and immediate causes. The long-term or underlying causes include militarism, which was marked by an arms race among Europe's great powers; nationalism, where intense national pride and ethnic tensions destabilized the continent; imperialism, as countries competed for colonies and influence around the globe; and a tangled system of alliances (such as the Triple Entente and the Central Powers) that meant any conflict could rapidly escalate. 

The immediate trigger was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in June 1914, which set off a chain reaction of mobilizations and declarations of war among allied nations. 

The consequences of World War I were profound. Politically, it led to the collapse of major empires such as the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, and German empires, and the harsh conditions imposed by treaties—especially the Treaty of Versailles—left deep economic and political scars, particularly on Germany. Socially, the war resulted in unprecedented loss of life and reshaped societies across Europe with widespread grief and disruption. Economically, the massive destruction and disruption of trade contributed to a severe instability that plagued the interwar period. Geopolitically, the redrawing of national boundaries and the reorganization of power in Europe helped set the stage for future conflicts, including World War II.
