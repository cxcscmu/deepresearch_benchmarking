Happiness, defined as a positive subjective state of well‐being and satisfaction, can significantly impact biological factors and health outcomes. Physiologically, happiness is associated with reduced stress hormone levels (such as cortisol), improved immune responses, a balanced production of neurotransmitters (like dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins), and better cardiovascular health, which together contribute to lowering inflammation and reducing the risk of stress-related diseases. Across different cultures, the experience of happiness is framed differently: in individualistic societies, it is often linked to personal achievement and self-care behavior that directly modulate physiological stress responses, whereas in collectivistic cultures, happiness is deeply connected to social bonds and communal support, which can also lead to beneficial biological effects. Hence, while the underlying biological pathways—like stress reduction and improved neurochemical regulation—are generally universal, the cultural context shapes how these processes are activated and reinforced, resulting in diverse manifestations of health benefits derived from happiness.
