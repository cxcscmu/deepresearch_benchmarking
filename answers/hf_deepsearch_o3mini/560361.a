Active euthanasia remains an ethically contentious practice. Proponents argue that by directly ending a life to alleviate unbearable suffering, it respects patient autonomy and upholds the right to a dignified deathâ€”an approach supported by consequentialist reasoning aimed at reducing overall harm. Opponents maintain that actively ending a life violates the sanctity of life, undermines the traditional role of healthcare providers, and risks a slippery slope toward involuntary or coerced practices. Ultimately, whether active euthanasia is ethical depends on the underlying ethical framework one adopts, making it a deeply complex issue with no universally agreed-upon answer.
