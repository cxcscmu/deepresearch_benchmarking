The question of whether World War II was justified by its results is profoundly complex and ultimately depends on the ethical framework one adopts. On one hand, from a utilitarian perspective, the war might be seen as justified by its results: the defeat of fascist regimes, the prevention of further genocides, and the creation of international institutions like the United Nations have arguably contributed to a more stable and just world order in the long term. On the other hand, from a deontological or rights-based standpoint, the enormous human costs—millions of lives lost, widespread suffering, and extensive destruction—are in themselves morally indefensible, and no positive outcome can fully justify such atrocities. In sum, while the war’s outcomes helped to end regimes responsible for severe atrocities, whether these outcomes morally justify the means is still intensely debated by historians and ethicists. Therefore, the answer remains inherently subjective and dependent on one’s moral framework.
