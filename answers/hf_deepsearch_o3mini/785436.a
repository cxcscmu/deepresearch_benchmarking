The answer depends on how racism is defined. If racism is seen simply as prejudice or discrimination based on race, then yes, white people can experience acts of racial prejudice. However, if racism is defined as a systemic power structure that privileges one race over others, then the term is generally not applied to white people in contexts where they are the dominant group. Thus, the answer is nuanced: while white people can face individual discriminatory acts, these incidents may not align with the systemic definition of racism used by many scholars.
