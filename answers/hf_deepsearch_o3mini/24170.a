A multifaceted approach is needed to address school shootings. Key measures include: 1. Expanding access to mental health services and early intervention programs to ensure students receive timely support; 2. Implementing comprehensive gun regulations, including expanded background checks, red flag laws, and restrictions on high-capacity firearms to reduce access by high-risk individuals; 3. Enhancing school safety protocols with balanced measures such as controlled access, strategic surveillance, and robust emergency preparedness training that maintain a supportive educational atmosphere; 4. Strengthening collaborations among schools, families, law enforcement, and mental health professionals for early threat detection and intervention; 5. Promoting educational initiatives focused on conflict resolution, empathy, and social-emotional learning to address underlying causes of violence; and 6. Committing to ongoing research and policy review to ensure that interventions remain effective and evidence-based over time.
