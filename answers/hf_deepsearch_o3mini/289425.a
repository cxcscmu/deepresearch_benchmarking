Reconstruction failed because it was undermined by a mix of factors: a decline in Northern political will, insufficient federal enforcement (especially after the Compromise of 1877), rampant violence and resistance by Southern white supremacist groups, and economic structures like sharecropping that maintained oppressive, pre-war social hierarchies. Together, these forces prevented the successful transformation of Southern society after the Civil War.
