The chip shortage is the result of several interrelated factors. Firstly, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions in global supply chains by closing factories and delaying logistics, which significantly affected production. Secondly, there was an unprecedented surge in demand for semiconductors, driven by the shift to remote work, increased consumer electronics usage, and the automotive industry's need for advanced chips. Thirdly, semiconductor manufacturing is a complex and capital-intensive process with long lead times, meaning capacity cannot be ramped up quickly to meet sudden spikes in demand. Lastly, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions have further complicated the supply and manufacturing processes. Together, these factors have created a perfect storm leading to the current chip shortage.
