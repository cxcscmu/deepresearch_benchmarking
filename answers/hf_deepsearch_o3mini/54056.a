World War II has had profound and lasting effects on international relations. Politically, it restructured global power by establishing the U.S. and the Soviet Union as superpowers, leading to the bipolar Cold War era. Diplomatically, it spurred the formation of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, which have underpinned international cooperation and global governance. In terms of security, the emergence of nuclear weapons and the doctrine of nuclear deterrence have reshaped military strategies and led to arms control efforts. Furthermore, the post-war decolonization process redrew national boundaries and introduced many new states into the international arena, significantly influencing regional and global power dynamics. Together, these factors have fundamentally redefined diplomatic practices, international law, and the overall structure of global relations even today.
