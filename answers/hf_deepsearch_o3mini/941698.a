Differences in perception arise from multiple interrelated factors. Biological factors (such as variations in sensory organs and neural processing), cognitive factors (including attention, memory, experiences, and biases), experiential factors (like personal history and learning), cultural and social influences (social norms and cultural context), emotional and motivational states (current moods and drives), as well as situational and contextual cues all contribute to shaping the unique perceptual lens each person uses to interpret the world.
