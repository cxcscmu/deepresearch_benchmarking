Socrates profoundly changed the world by introducing a new way of thinking based on inquiry and dialogue. His method of questioning—now known as the Socratic Method—challenged assumptions and encouraged rigorous critical reasoning. By relentlessly pursuing truth and questioning conventional wisdom, he not only influenced his most prominent student, Plato, but also shaped the foundations of Western philosophy. His legacy is evident in modern education, legal reasoning, and democratic discourse, where the art of question-driven inquiry continues to thrive, inspiring individuals to think deeply and critically about the world around them.
