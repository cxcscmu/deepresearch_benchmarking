Video games do not cause violence because extensive research demonstrates that any short-term increases in laboratory measures of aggression do not translate into real-world violent behavior. Despite the rise in video game consumption over the past decades, violent crime rates have generally declined or remained stable. Furthermore, when studies control for confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, family environment, and personality traits, video games are not found to be a significant predictor of violence. Hence, while video games may momentarily affect mood or arousal, the scientific consensus is that they are not a causal factor in societal violence.
