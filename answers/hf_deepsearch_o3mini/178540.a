Many people tend to give more importance to their body than their mind because physical attributes are immediately visible and subject to quick social evaluation. This visibility brings rapid, tangible social rewards—like compliments and admiration—which reinforce a focus on appearances. In contrast, intellectual abilities are abstract, take longer to assess, and are less influenced by media and advertising. Historical and evolutionary factors, combined with modern media emphasis on beauty, result in a societal trend that favors the body over the mind.
