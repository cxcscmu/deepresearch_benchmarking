Men commit crimes at higher rates than women due to a complex interplay of factors. Biologically, higher levels of testosterone in men are linked to increased aggression and risk-taking. Sociologically, traditional gender roles and socialization processes promote behaviors such as assertiveness and dominance in men, which can lead to a greater propensity for criminal behavior. Additionally, cultural norms, economic pressures, and peer influences create environments where men are more likely to encounter or engage in criminal activities. Thus, it is the combination of these biological, cultural, and environmental factors that contributes to the observed disparity in crime rates.
