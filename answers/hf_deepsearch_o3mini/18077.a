After reviewing the complex interplay of legal, ethical, medical, and historical factors, it appears that legal, regulated abortion is generally preferable to criminalization. Legal abortion helps safeguard reproductive health and autonomy by reducing the risks associated with unsafe procedures, while also allowing societies to impose context-sensitive regulations. Nevertheless, this remains a deeply contentious issue influenced by diverse moral, cultural, and legal values. From a public policy and health perspective, maintaining legal, regulated abortion services is the approach most consistent with protecting individual rights and public health outcomes.
