World War II is often considered justified from a historical and moral perspective, primarily because it was waged to stop the aggressive expansion and horrific atrocities committed by totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany. Using the lens of Just War Theory—which emphasizes just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, proportionality, and last resort—the Allied actions can be seen as a necessary recourse to end a catastrophic threat that endangered millions of lives. However, the immense human suffering, the strategic choices that led to severe civilian casualties (including those at Hiroshima and Nagasaki), and the overall destruction wrought by the conflict also serve as a powerful reminder of the moral ambiguities of war. Thus, while the defeat of fascism and the restoration of peace can be argued as a justified aim, the profound human cost and ethical dilemmas inherent in the conflict make the issue complex and subject to diverse interpretations. In summary, many historians and ethicists acknowledge that, despite its tragic consequences, World War II was justified in its essential goal of halting extreme tyranny, even as it remains a sober testament to the terrible price of war.
