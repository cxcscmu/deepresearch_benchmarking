The interaction between biological, psychological, and social-cultural factors in the development of psychological disorders is best understood through the biopsychosocial model. Biological factors, such as genetic vulnerabilities, neurotransmitter imbalances, and structural brain differences, create an underlying susceptibility. Psychological factors—including cognition, personality traits, emotional regulation, and past experiences—mediate and sometimes intensify these vulnerabilities. Social-cultural factors, such as family dynamics, cultural norms, socioeconomic status, and environmental stress, act as external triggers or moderators that can either precipitate or buffer the onset of mental health issues. These factors interact dynamically; for example, chronic social stress can lead to neurochemical changes that affect how an individual processes emotions and experiences, ultimately contributing to the emergence of specific psychological disorders.
