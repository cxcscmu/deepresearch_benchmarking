Nursing research is essential for safe nursing practice because it provides the evidence base needed to identify risks, test interventions, and develop effective safety protocols. By systematically studying clinical processes and patient outcomes, research uncovers potential hazards and validates new methods, such as improved infection control measures, medication safety practices, and fall prevention strategies. This evidence-based approach not only guides policy and practice updates but also promotes continuous quality improvement, ensuring that care remains current and responsive to emerging challenges. Ultimately, research empowers nurses to deliver care that is both effective and safe.
