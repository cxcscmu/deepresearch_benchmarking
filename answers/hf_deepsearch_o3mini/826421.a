### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Empirical evidence indicates that nurses may spend a significant portion of their shifts on EHR documentation—studies report figures ranging from about 15–22% in some contexts to medians around 50% and means over 56%. Additionally, qualitative surveys have shown that up to 75% of clinicians feel that this documentation burden excessively detracts from direct patient care.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Several systematic reviews and empirical studies have assessed nurses’ time spent on EHR tasks. For instance, one systematic review (PMC, Aug 2021) found that nurses spent anywhere between 25% and 98% of their shift interacting with the EHR, with a median of around 50% and a mean of approximately 56.6%. Other studies note that during a 12-hour shift, nurses may spend around 157 minutes (or about 22% of their shift) solely on EHR documentation. Conversely, different methodologies and categorization of tasks sometimes result in lower reported percentages, such as an overall documentation time of around 15.8% (split between paper and electronic media). Despite this variability, a common concern emerging from qualitative data and surveys (e.g., an AMIA survey) is that a large majority (up to 75% of clinicians) believe that the current volume of documentation is excessive and interferes with direct patient care.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The differences in reported documentation times arise from the diverse methodologies used across studies, variations in clinical settings (e.g., emergency departments versus inpatient units), and differing definitions of what constitutes documentation (active charting vs. passive review). In response, there's a growing call for improvements in EHR system design, streamlined workflows, targeted training, and revised guidelines to shift the balance toward more patient-centered care while reducing administrative burdens.
