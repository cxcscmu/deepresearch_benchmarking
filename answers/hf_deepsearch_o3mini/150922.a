People believe in fake news due to a confluence of factors. Cognitive biases such as confirmation bias lead individuals to favor information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs, while the illusory truth effect makes repeated exposure to misinformation feel more credible. Additionally, social media algorithms create echo chambers that reinforce existing views by consistently showing similar content. Emotional appeals and sensationalism further drive the acceptance of fake news, and lower levels of media literacy reduce the ability to critically assess and verify the information encountered. These psychological, social, and technological factors together explain why fake news often resonates as truth with many people.
