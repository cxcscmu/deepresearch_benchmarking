I see globalisation as a dynamic force that fosters economic growth, technological innovation, and cultural exchange, creating unprecedented opportunities for connecting people and markets globally. However, I believe that without a strong commitment to sustainable development—which ensures environmental protection, social justice, and future resource integrity—these benefits can be undermined by ecological degradation and social inequities. Thus, my view is that the promise of globalisation must be harnessed in tandem with sustainability practices to achieve long-term, inclusive progress.
