Women tend to get paid less than men due to a blend of structural, socio-economic, and cultural factors. Key contributors include occupational segregation, where women are more likely to work in lower-paid sectors or roles; career interruptions and higher rates of part-time work—often related to caregiving responsibilities—that limit work experience and seniority; and both overt and subtle biases in hiring and promotion practices. Additionally, work traditionally done by women is frequently undervalued in the labor market, reinforcing the gap even when controlling for factors like experience or education. Overall, while some of the pay gap can be explained by measurable factors, a significant portion remains unexplained, strongly suggesting that systemic discrimination and entrenched societal biases continue to play a role.
