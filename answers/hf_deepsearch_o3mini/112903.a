Many people might be skeptical about psychology being a science because it often struggles with rigor due to the inherent complexity of studying human behavior. Its methods, which frequently rely on subjective reports, observational data, and experiments that lack strict reproducibility, contrast with the highly controlled and measurable techniques used in the natural sciences. Additionally, historical debates and controversies, such as those surrounding psychoanalytic theories and the replicability crisis, further fuel skepticism regarding its scientific status.
