Based on extensive ethical, legal, and empirical considerations, reintroducing the death penalty is generally not advisable. While some argue it could serve as a deterrent or fulfill a retributive function, the evidence on deterrence remains inconclusive, and the risk of irreversible wrongful convictions—coupled with significant human rights and ethical concerns—outweighs these potential gains. Furthermore, the global trend has been toward abolition and the adoption of criminal justice practices that focus on rehabilitation and restorative approaches. Therefore, from a balanced perspective, the death penalty should not be reintroduced.
