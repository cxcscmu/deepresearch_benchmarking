In American democracy, the appropriate balance is achieved by ensuring that government power is exercised only to secure the common good—providing security, order, and public welfare—while being tightly constrained by constitutional limits to protect individual liberties. This balance, grounded in the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Federalist tradition, is dynamic: the state intervenes only when necessary, and such intervention is subject to judicial, legislative, and civic checks. Ultimately, the government must be strong enough to serve society yet limited enough to allow personal freedom to flourish.
