The answer is nuanced. While some abstract domains – such as basic mathematics or the laws of physics – might seem to embody universal truths that are independent of cultural influences, the very process of formulating, understanding, and communicating these truths is inevitably shaped by cultural factors. In essence, certain pieces of knowledge may appear universally valid, but they are still embedded within and expressed through culturally specific frameworks.
