The relationship between punishment and crime is complex. While deterrence theory predicts that a punishment perceived as certain, swift, and proportionate can deter potential offenders by increasing the perceived risks of criminal activity, empirical research reveals that its effectiveness is highly contingent upon broader social, economic, and procedural factors. As such, though punishment can have a deterrent effect under specific conditions, it is not universally effective on its own and should be combined with other crime prevention and rehabilitation strategies.
