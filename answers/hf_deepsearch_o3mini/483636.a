Culture fundamentally shapes identity by offering a shared framework of beliefs, values, traditions, and practices that individuals internalize through socialization. It provides the symbolic systems and narratives that help define who we are, influence our behaviors, and set us in relation to our social groups. Theories like Social Identity Theory and Cultural Dimensions Theory illustrate that our membership in culturally defined groups contributes to our self-concept, self-esteem, and worldviews. In a globalized world, identities continue to evolve as cultures interact, blend, and sometimes clash, leading to the dynamic and multifaceted identities seen in contemporary society.
