According to the Christian worldview, the solution to human problems is found in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. Human problems are seen as stemming from sin and the resulting separation from God. Through Jesus’ sacrificial death and resurrection, believers receive forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life. This act of divine grace not only addresses the root problem—the consequence of sin—but also transforms lives, restoring hope and offering a path to spiritual renewal both now and in eternity.
