Global cities are key nodes in the global economy that attract vast capital flows, skilled talent, and multinational companies, which leads to booming high-value sectors. However, this also creates a dual economy where high-income professionals thrive in well-resourced areas while lower-income populations are pushed into less-serviced neighborhoods. This dichotomy—exacerbated by accelerating real estate prices, gentrification, polarized labor markets, and urban planning choices that favor investment over inclusive development—results in marked inequality. In short, the forces of globalization and economic concentration, combined with policy and planning challenges, drive the notable inequality witnessed in global cities.
