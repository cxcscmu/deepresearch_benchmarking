Legal abortion is crucial because it protects womenâ€™s bodily autonomy and ensures their right to make decisions about their own health. It helps to prevent the dangerous consequences of unsafe procedures, thereby reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. By legalizing abortion, society supports gender equality and economic empowerment, as women can better plan their reproductive lives, leading to improved social and economic outcomes. Moreover, legal access to abortion upholds fundamental human rights and ensures that health care is delivered safely and equitably.
