A health care manager plays a critical role in addressing ethical dilemmas. They must first recognize ethical issues and then lead a transparent and systematic decision-making process. This involves gathering and assessing all relevant facts, consulting with ethics committees and stakeholders, and ensuring that decisions align with legal, regulatory, and organizational standards. By balancing competing interests—those of patients, healthcare providers, and the institution—health care managers serve as ethical stewards who integrate moral principles (such as autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) into their operational and strategic decisions, ultimately fostering an environment of trust, accountability, and integrity.
