Capital punishment's ethical status is highly contested. On one hand, proponents argue from a retributivist and consequentialist standpoint that, when applied with strict procedural safeguards, it serves as a just punishment and a deterrent against grave offenses. On the other hand, opponents—drawing from deontological and rights-based principles—maintain that state-sanctioned execution violates the inherent right to life and risks irrevocable errors, regardless of any societal benefits. Ultimately, whether capital punishment is ethical depends on one’s moral framework, the fairness and reliability of the legal system, and the weight given to deterrence versus human dignity. There is no universally accepted answer, and the debate remains deeply contextual and value-driven.
