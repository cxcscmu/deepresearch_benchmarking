While direct studies on daily Twitter use in under-16s are limited due to usage restrictions on the platform, broader research on social media indicates that frequent exposure to rapid, constantly updating information—similar to what occurs on Twitter—can lead to reduced sustained attention. This appears to be due to cognitive overload and the habitual multitasking that such media promote, although individual differences and overall screen habits also play significant roles. Thus, while the effect may be modest and context-dependent, the available evidence suggests that daily Twitter use could be associated with a shorter attention span in this age group, warranting further research for definitive conclusions.
