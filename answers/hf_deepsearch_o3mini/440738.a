Considering the complexity of the issue, euthanasia might be ethically justifiable and legally permissible if it is strictly regulated. A robust legal framework must ensure informed consent, thorough medical and psychological evaluations, clear eligibility criteria, and effective oversight to protect vulnerable individuals from coercion or abuse. In this context, legalizing euthanasia can be seen as a compassionate option for those suffering from incurable and unbearable conditions. However, without such safeguards, its legalization could lead to significant ethical and social risks. Ultimately, whether euthanasia should be legal depends on oneâ€™s ethical perspective and the rigor of the legal protections in place.
