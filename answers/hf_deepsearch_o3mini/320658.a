Euthanasia is an ethically complex issue. It may be justified under stringent circumstancesâ€”specifically, when a competent individual voluntarily opts for it to escape unbearable suffering, and when robust safeguards and regulatory mechanisms are in place to ensure that the decision is informed and free from coercion. However, because of fundamental concerns regarding the sanctity of life, potential abuses, and varying cultural, moral, and legal perspectives, its justification is necessarily context-dependent and remains a subject of intense ethical and legal debate.
