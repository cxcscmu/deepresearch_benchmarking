Arts can tell us that life is a vibrant interplay of emotion, thought, and experience. They provide a mirror reflecting the human condition—capturing beauty, pain, joy, and struggle—through diverse mediums such as painting, literature, music, theater, and film. In art, we witness a symbolic conversation about our cultural narratives, personal identities, and universal existential dilemmas, inviting us to explore the depths of what it means to be human.
