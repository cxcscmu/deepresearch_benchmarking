Children develop a nuanced understanding of different types of norms through varied experiences. When they witness or experience situations involving harm and fairness—such as seeing the hurt caused by harmful actions—they learn that some rules (moral imperatives) are universally important. By contrast, observing cultural or school-specific practices, like how different families or communities handle mealtime rules or dress codes, leads them to recognize that some norms (social conventions) are flexible and context-bound. Finally, through opportunities to make choices, like selecting a favorite snack or game, they see that many decisions are ultimately a matter of personal preference. Guided conversations and reflections with caregivers and educators further help them understand that while moral imperatives are about protecting wellbeing and justice, social conventions are designed to organize group behavior, and personal choices reflect individual tastes.
