Euthanasia is a complex moral issue. On one side, arguments emphasizing autonomy, compassion, and the relief of unbearable suffering support the view that voluntary euthanasia—when performed with informed consent and strict safeguards—can be morally justified. On the other side, perspectives that stress the sanctity of life, non-maleficence, and the risks of a slippery slope argue against it. Consequently, there is no universally accepted answer; rather, euthanasia’s moral justification depends on context, the specific type practiced (voluntary versus non‐voluntary), and the ethical framework applied. In carefully controlled circumstances, especially to alleviate extreme suffering, it may be considered morally acceptable, but this position remains heavily debated and contingent on societal, legal, and ethical safeguards.
