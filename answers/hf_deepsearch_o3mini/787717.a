Abortion is legal because legal frameworks in many jurisdictions prioritize protecting individual rightsâ€”especially a woman's right to bodily autonomy, privacy, and reproductive freedom. Landmark decisions, such as Roe v. Wade in the United States, have established that these rights permit a woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. These legal principles balance the state's interest in protecting potential life against the fundamental right to personal liberty and health, and they also factor in public health concerns by reducing the risks associated with unsafe, illegal abortions. While the specific legal rationale can vary by jurisdiction, the central justification is that legal access to abortion is essential for ensuring individual freedom and safeguarding public health.
