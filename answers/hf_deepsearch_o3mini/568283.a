Gender inequality is problematic for several interrelated reasons:

1. Unequal Opportunity: Gender inequality limits access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. This not only undermines individual potential but also restricts societal progress, as a significant portion of the population is unable to contribute fully to the economy and innovation.

2. Economic Consequences: When women and other marginalized genders are excluded or underrepresented in the workforce, it leads to lower overall productivity and economic growth. Studies have shown that bridging the gender gap could significantly boost global GDP, because it makes available a vast pool of untapped talent and fosters more diverse and innovative work environments.

3. Political and Social Impact: Underrepresentation in political and decision-making processes means that policies often do not reflect the needs of all segments of society. This perpetuates social injustice and can lead to policies that fail to address crucial issues, resulting in a cycle of inequality and marginalization.

4. Cultural and Human Rights: Gender inequality reinforces harmful stereotypes and can lead to various forms of discrimination and social exclusion. This not only violates basic human rights but also limits the capacity for social cohesion, fairness, and mutual respect which are essential for a healthy society.

In summary, gender inequality is a problem because it creates economic inefficiencies, limits innovation, undermines democratic values, and violates human rights, all of which work together to impede a society's progress and the well-being of its citizens.
