In a post Covid‐19 landscape, international business is likely to be transformed by several key trends. First, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation, leading to a surge in remote work, virtual collaboration, and the adoption of digital tools for everything from sales to supply chain management. Companies are now increasingly investing in digital infrastructures to support these remote operations. Second, the significant disruptions in global supply chains during the pandemic have underscored the need for resilience and diversification. As a result, businesses may pursue strategies such as reshoring, nearshoring, or multi-sourcing to mitigate risks associated with global disruptions. Third, shifts in geopolitics and trade policies—exacerbated by the crisis—might result in a more regionally nuanced approach to globalization, where nations reassess dependency on long international supply networks and prioritize strategic autonomy. Fourth, evolving consumer behavior, combined with emerging sustainability and ESG considerations, will likely drive companies to rethink their operational and strategic priorities. Overall, these changes suggest that international business will become more agile, digitally oriented, and regionally integrated, reflecting a balance between global connectivity and local resilience.
