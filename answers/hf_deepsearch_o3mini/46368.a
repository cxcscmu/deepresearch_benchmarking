Young people typically vote less due to a confluence of factors: many feel politically disillusioned and believe that established political institutions do not represent their interests, which contributes to a sense of disenfranchisement. Additionally, structural barriers like complex registration processes and a lack of targeted civic education, combined with competing life priorities and a reliance on non-traditional information channels, further discourage them from participating in elections.
