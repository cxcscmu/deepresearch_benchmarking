Abortion should be supported because it upholds bodily autonomy and personal freedom, enabling individuals to make decisions about their own bodies. Legal, regulated abortion minimizes health risks associated with unsafe procedures, thereby protecting women's lives. Furthermore, ensuring access to abortion is a cornerstone of reproductive rights as recognized in legal and human rights frameworks. It contributes to socio-economic stability by allowing women to plan their futures, pursue education and employment opportunities, and break cycles of poverty, all of which promote gender equality. Ethically, many argue that the rights and health of the pregnant person should take precedence, which further reinforces the case for legal and accessible abortion.
