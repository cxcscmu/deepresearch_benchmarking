The U.S. military has seen a mixed record in learning from history since 1945. On the one hand, early setbacks—such as the counterinsurgency failures in Vietnam—spurred profound doctrinal and organizational reforms, leading to innovations like joint and network-centric operations and the modernization of warfare strategies. On the other hand, recurring challenges, such as adapting to irregular warfare, bureaucratic inertia, and occasional strategic miscalculations in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, show that institutional learning has been uneven. Overall, while significant progress has been made in institutionalizing lessons through continuous reforms and technological advances, the process remains imperfect and ongoing.
