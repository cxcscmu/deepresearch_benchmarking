People often become cult leaders due to a combination of personal traits and social context. On the personal side, many possess extreme narcissism, charisma, and a desire for controlâ€”traits that may develop from personal traumas or issues with identity. Socially, environments marked by instability, economic stress, or widespread disillusionment create fertile ground for these personalities to attract followers by promising radical solutions and a sense of belonging.
