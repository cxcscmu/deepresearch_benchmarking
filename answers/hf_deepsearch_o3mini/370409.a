Addressing the drug problem requires a multifaceted approach. First, invest robustly in prevention and education to reduce demand, including community programs and school-based initiatives that inform about the risks of drug use. Second, expand and improve access to evidence-based treatment and harm reduction services—such as safe injection sites, needle exchange programs, and comprehensive rehabilitation services—to protect public health and support recovery. Third, reform drug policies so that low-level users are treated as individuals in need of care rather than offenders, while law enforcement resources are focused on dismantling large-scale drug trafficking networks. Finally, ensure all strategies are supported by reliable data and continually assessed through inter-agency collaboration, so that policies can adapt to evolving challenges and ultimately reduce both the social and economic harms associated with drug abuse.
