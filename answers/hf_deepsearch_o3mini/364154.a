Conservatives generally agree on core ideological principles such as tradition, free markets, limited government, and national security. However, when it comes to specific societal policies—like immigration, social reform, and the balance between liberty and government intervention—their opinions tend to diverge significantly. In short, there is notable consensus on basic values, but detailed policy preferences vary widely depending on regional, historical, and sub-ideological influences.
