Religion does not cause war in a direct or deterministic way. While historical conflicts such as the Crusades or the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War have involved significant religious components, these wars were driven by a complex mix of political, economic, social, and cultural factors. In many cases, religion is mobilized to legitimize or frame conflicts rather than serving as the sole cause. Therefore, religion may contribute to war but is typically only one of many interrelated factors.
