Globalization redistributes power by diluting traditional state sovereignty while enhancing transnational connectivity and citizen empowerment. As global trade, digital communication, and supranational institutions gain prominence, states find their policy choices increasingly constrained by international norms and economic interdependencies. At the same time, citizens benefit from improved access to information and new channels of mobilization, enabling them to influence governance beyond national borders. In summary, globalization is shifting the balance from a purely state-centric model to a more networked, multi-actor arena where power is continually negotiated between states, global institutions, and empowered citizens.
