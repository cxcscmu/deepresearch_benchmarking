Arguments in favor of allowing the death penalty include: 

1. Deterrence: Proponents argue that the threat of execution may deter potential criminals from committing heinous crimes, thereby helping to maintain public safety. 

2. Retributive Justice: For many, capital punishment is seen as a morally appropriate response to the gravest offenses—particularly murder or acts of terrorism—where the punishment mirrors the severity of the crime. 

3. Prevention of Recidivism: Execution guarantees that an offender, who has committed extremely dangerous acts, will never be able to reoffend, thereby permanently removing the threat from society. 

4. Closure for Victims’ Families: Some argue that the death penalty can provide a sense of justice and closure to families who have suffered loss due to violent crimes. 

5. Economic Considerations: Though contentious, some contend that in very specific cases, the costs associated with long-term incarceration may be mitigated by executing those convicted of the most serious crimes. 


It is important to note that these arguments are part of a complex and ongoing debate, and each point is countered by significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns. Nonetheless, these factors form the basis of the argument for why some believe the death penalty should be allowed.
