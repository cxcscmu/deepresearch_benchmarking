Ending sexual violence in the military requires a comprehensive, multi-tiered strategy that integrates policy reform, cultural change, independent oversight, and robust support systems for survivors. Key elements include: 1) A clear, zero-tolerance policy with consistent, strong disciplinary measures for perpetrators; 2) Independent investigative bodies that remove conflicts of interest and ensure transparency in handling allegations; 3) Mandatory and ongoing training programs focusing on sexual harassment prevention, consent education, and gender sensitivity tailored to military contexts; 4) Secure, confidential reporting mechanisms that protect victims and whistleblowers from reprisals; 5) Accessible support services including medical, legal, and psychological care for survivors; 6) Structural reforms to address inherent power imbalances in military hierarchies; and 7) Ongoing monitoring, public accountability, and cultural transformation efforts. This integrated approach is essential to eradicate sexual violence within military institutions.
