The answer is: it depends. Homeschooling may be better for students who thrive with personalized, flexible instruction and have strong parental support, while public schools might be preferable for those who benefit from diverse social interactions, a wide range of extracurricular activities, and structured environments. Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific needs, circumstances, and priorities of the student and the family.
