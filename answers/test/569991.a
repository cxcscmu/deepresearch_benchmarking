Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach involving international cooperation, national policies, technological innovation, and societal engagement. Key strategies include:

**1. Strengthening International Agreements**

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a pivotal international treaty aiming to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels. It mandates countries to set and update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outlining their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regular global stocktakes assess collective progress, encouraging nations to enhance their commitments over time.

**2. Accelerating Renewable Energy Deployment**

Transitioning to renewable energy sources is crucial. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has indicated that tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 is achievable with concerted efforts to overcome challenges like permitting and grid integration. This expansion is essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting emissions.

**3. Implementing Carbon Pricing Mechanisms**

Economic instruments like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems incentivize emission reductions. Recently, major shipping nations agreed on a global fee for greenhouse gas emissions from ships, imposing a $100 fee per ton of emissions above set thresholds starting in 2027. This initiative aims to generate funds for cleaner shipping technologies and assist developing nations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/98ff23ca4739d8b4fc5a8f941a7ca0c4?utm_source=openai))

**4. Ensuring a Just Transition**

A just transition emphasizes equitable treatment of all communities during the shift to a low-carbon economy. This involves creating fair and secure jobs, investing in low-emission industries, and ensuring that no group is disproportionately affected by the transition. International cooperation and support for developing countries are vital to achieve this. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition?utm_source=openai))

**5. Enhancing Climate Finance**

Developed countries have committed to mobilizing $100 billion annually to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing nations. This financial support is crucial for building resilience and enabling sustainable development in vulnerable regions.

**6. Promoting Technological Innovation and Energy Efficiency**

Investing in research and development of clean technologies, improving energy efficiency, and modernizing infrastructure are essential steps. These actions not only reduce emissions but also drive economic growth and create new employment opportunities.

**7. Engaging Society and Subnational Actors**

Grassroots initiatives, local governments, and businesses play a significant role in climate action. Their involvement ensures that efforts are tailored to local contexts and can lead to innovative solutions. For instance, despite national policy shifts, subnational actors in the U.S. have continued to advance climate initiatives, demonstrating the importance of diverse stakeholders in driving progress.

By integrating these strategies, the global community can work collaboratively to mitigate climate change and build a sustainable future.
