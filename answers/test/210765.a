World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, was a global conflict that resulted in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. The question of whether the war was justified by its outcomes is complex and has been the subject of extensive analysis and debate.

**Outcomes of World War II:**

1. **Defeat of Totalitarian Regimes:** The Allied victory led to the dismantling of aggressive totalitarian regimes, notably Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, which had perpetrated extensive human rights abuses and acts of aggression.

2. **Establishment of the United Nations:** In 1945, the United Nations was founded with the aim of preventing future global conflicts and promoting international cooperation.

3. **Decolonization Movements:** The war weakened European colonial powers, accelerating movements for independence in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. For instance, India gained independence from Britain in 1947, leading to the partition into India and Pakistan.

4. **Economic and Technological Advancements:** Post-war reconstruction efforts spurred economic growth and technological innovation, particularly in war-torn regions.

**Justification of the War:**

The justification of World War II is often evaluated through the lens of its necessity to halt the expansion of aggressive totalitarian regimes and to address the atrocities they committed. The war is widely regarded as a necessary response to unprovoked aggression and egregious human rights violations. A YouGov poll indicated that 66% of Americans believed the U.S. role in World War II was justified, reflecting a broad consensus on the war's necessity.

However, the war also resulted in significant civilian casualties, including the controversial use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some argue that these actions, while hastening the end of the war, raised ethical questions about the means used to achieve victory.

In summary, while World War II led to the defeat of oppressive regimes and the establishment of institutions aimed at promoting global peace, it also caused immense human suffering. The general consensus is that the war was justified by the necessity to confront and defeat aggressive totalitarian powers, despite the profound costs involved.
