Legalizing divorce offers numerous benefits that enhance individual well-being and societal health. Key arguments in favor of legalizing divorce include:

**1. Protection from Harmful Relationships**

Legalizing divorce provides individuals, particularly women and children, with a legal means to escape abusive or dysfunctional marriages. Without this option, many remain trapped in harmful situations, leading to long-term psychological and physical harm. For instance, in the Philippines, where divorce is illegal, individuals in such marriages lack legal recourse to end their suffering.

**2. Enhancement of Mental and Emotional Well-being**

Being stuck in an unhappy marriage can take a toll on mental and emotional health. Legalizing divorce would allow individuals to leave unfulfilling or toxic relationships, thereby improving their overall well-being and quality of life.

**3. Promotion of Gender Equality and Economic Empowerment**

The prohibition on divorce perpetuates gender inequality, as women often bear the brunt of oppressive and abusive marriages. Legalizing divorce can help address systemic inequalities and provide a pathway for women to assert their rights and achieve greater social and economic equality.

**4. Alignment with International Norms and Human Rights**

The Philippines' current stance on divorce is at odds with international norms and human rights principles. Legalizing divorce would bring the country in line with global standards and affirm its commitment to upholding human rights.

**5. Reduction in Domestic Violence and Female Suicide Rates**

Studies have shown that when laws make it easier and quicker to divorce, there are unexpected positive effects such as:

- Female suicides decrease by as much as 16%.

- Domestic violence decreases by around 30%.

In summary, legalizing divorce is a crucial step toward protecting individual rights, promoting mental health, ensuring gender equality, aligning with international human rights standards, and reducing domestic violence and suicide rates. It acknowledges the complexities of human relationships and provides a legal framework for individuals to pursue personal happiness and safety.
