Vaccines are generally safe and undergo rigorous testing before approval. Common side effects are typically mild and temporary, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever. Serious adverse events are extremely rare. ([who.int](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-global-vaccine-safety?utm_source=openai))

In the United States, vaccines are subject to stringent safety standards. They are tested extensively before approval and continuously monitored afterward to ensure their safety and effectiveness. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/safety/index.html?utm_source=openai))

While some vaccines have been associated with rare side effects, the benefits of vaccination in preventing serious diseases far outweigh these minimal risks. For instance, the Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has been linked to a very rare condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), but such cases are exceedingly uncommon.

It's important to note that the risk of severe illness from vaccine-preventable diseases is significantly higher than the risk of serious side effects from vaccines. Therefore, health authorities worldwide recommend vaccination as a safe and effective means of protecting public health.
