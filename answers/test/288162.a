Healthcare managers play a pivotal role in navigating ethical decisions within healthcare organizations. Their responsibilities encompass:

1. **Assessing Ethical Dilemmas**: Managers must thoroughly evaluate situations, considering the potential consequences of various actions on patients, staff, and the organization.

5. **Addressing Moral Distress**: Healthcare managers may experience moral distress when they feel unable to act according to their ethical beliefs due to organizational constraints. Recognizing and addressing this distress is crucial, as it can impact personal well-being and organizational effectiveness.
