The adage "war makes states" suggests that warfare has historically been a catalyst for state formation, compelling governments to develop robust institutions and centralized authority to mobilize resources and maintain control. This concept, extensively studied in the context of early modern Europe, posits that the pressures of war necessitate the creation of efficient bureaucracies and taxation systems, thereby strengthening state structures.

However, the applicability of this theory to the Middle East is complex, particularly when considering the role of rentierism. Rentier states derive a significant portion of their national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients, such as oil exports, rather than from domestic taxation. This economic structure can diminish the impetus for state-building activities typically driven by the need to extract resources from the populace.

In his 2011 study, Rolf Schwarz examines this dynamic by comparing four Arab states: Iraq and Jordan, which have experienced significant warfare, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Tunisia, which have not. Schwarz's analysis reveals that rentierism can impede the development of legitimate and institutionalized states. The influx of external rents allows governments to provide welfare and maintain patronage networks without developing strong institutions or engaging in the societal bargaining processes that war-induced taxation would typically necessitate. Consequently, these states may exhibit both weakness in institutional capacity and resilience against failure due to their financial resources. Notably, when rentier states engage in war-making as a strategy for state-building, they risk state failure and collapse.

This analysis suggests that while war has historically contributed to state formation by compelling the development of centralized authority and institutions, the presence of substantial external rents in Middle Eastern states can alter this trajectory. Rentierism provides financial means that can sustain states without the need for internal resource extraction, potentially leading to weaker institutional development. Therefore, the relationship between war, rentierism, and state formation in the Middle East is nuanced, indicating that the "war makes states" thesis may not universally apply in contexts where external rents play a significant role.
