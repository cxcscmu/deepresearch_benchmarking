The time nurses spend on documentation using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) varies across studies, with some indicating that EHRs may reduce documentation time, while others suggest an increase.

A 2012 study published in *Computers Informatics Nursing* found that nurses spent approximately 19% of their time on documentation, regardless of whether they used electronic or paper-based systems. This suggests that EHRs did not significantly alter the time dedicated to documentation. ([rand.org](https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP20120062.html?utm_source=openai))

Conversely, a 2022 study focusing on intensive care unit (ICU) nurses reported that full-time ICU nurses spent about 17.5% of their clinical shifts on EHR documentation, totaling approximately 28.9 hours per month. The majority of this time was allocated to documentation tasks. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180057/?utm_source=openai))

A systematic review published in 2005 in the *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association* indicated that the impact of EHRs on documentation time varied depending on the system's implementation. For instance, the use of bedside terminals was associated with a 24.5% reduction in documentation time, whereas central station desktops led to a 23.5% reduction.

Another study from 2019 observed that healthcare workers, including nurses, spent approximately 40% of their time on documentation activities, which was more than the time spent on direct patient care. This finding highlights the significant portion of time dedicated to documentation tasks. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7083584/?utm_source=openai))

In summary, while some studies suggest that EHRs can reduce documentation time, others indicate that nurses continue to spend a substantial portion of their shifts on documentation tasks. The variation in findings may be attributed to differences in EHR system design, implementation strategies, and the specific healthcare settings in which they are used.
