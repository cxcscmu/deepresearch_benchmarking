This directly supports the statement in full."

        "justification": "The citation explicitly states that in American adults, experiencing high levels of positive emotions is associated with healthier blood-lipid profiles, which are important indicators of heart health. The statement is accurate according to the citation, though it is important to note that the effect was not observed in Japanese adults, but the statement does not specify a cultural context, so the general claim is supported."

        "justification": "The citations discuss associations between happiness and longer lifespan, as well as positive emotional states being linked to better health and longevity, even after controlling for some health behaviors. However, there is also mention of studies that found no direct effect of happiness on mortality when controlling for health, and the evidence is described as mixed. The statement is partially supported, as the relationship is not universally confirmed and some studies contradict the claim."

This supports the statement that there is a correlation between happiness (positive emotions) and cardiovascular health in the US. The citation also notes that this link was not found in Japan, emphasizing the cultural specificity, but the statement is about the US, which is fully supported."

The study found that in the U.S., motivation to pursue happiness predicted lower well-being, and the discussion explicitly links this to the self-focused nature of happiness pursuit in such cultures. Therefore, the statement is fully supported by the citation."

The study directly tests and supports the statement, showing that the link between pursuing happiness and well-being is positive in collectivistic cultures and is mediated by the socially-engaged pursuit of happiness."
