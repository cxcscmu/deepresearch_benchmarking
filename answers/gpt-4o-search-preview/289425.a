Reconstruction, the period following the American Civil War (1865–1877), aimed to reintegrate the Southern states into the Union and establish rights for newly freed African Americans. Despite initial progress, Reconstruction ultimately failed due to a combination of political opposition, economic challenges, social resistance, and waning federal commitment.

**Political Opposition and Violence**

Southern white Democrats, intent on restoring pre-war social hierarchies, actively resisted Reconstruction efforts. They employed violence and intimidation, notably through groups like the Ku Klux Klan, to suppress Black political participation and undermine Republican policies. This climate of fear significantly hindered the enforcement of Reconstruction measures.

**Economic Challenges**

The Southern economy was devastated after the Civil War, leaving many African Americans in poverty. The promise of "40 acres and a mule" was largely unfulfilled, forcing many freedmen into sharecropping—a system that perpetuated economic dependency and limited opportunities for advancement.

**Legal and Constitutional Setbacks**

Although the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were enacted to secure rights for African Americans, their effectiveness was undermined by discriminatory practices. Southern states implemented Black Codes and Jim Crow laws, imposing restrictions on employment, land ownership, and voting rights. These laws, coupled with Supreme Court decisions like the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which narrowly interpreted the 14th Amendment, weakened federal protections and allowed systemic discrimination to persist.

**Withdrawal of Federal Support**

The Compromise of 1877 marked a significant turning point. In exchange for resolving the disputed 1876 presidential election in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes, federal troops were withdrawn from the South. This removal effectively ended Reconstruction efforts, leaving African Americans vulnerable to disenfranchisement and racial violence.

In summary, Reconstruction failed due to concerted efforts by Southern whites to overturn its gains, economic hardships that maintained African American dependency, legal setbacks that eroded civil rights protections, and the eventual withdrawal of federal enforcement. These factors combined to restore white supremacy in the South and delay the realization of full civil rights for African Americans for nearly a century.
