The gender pay gap, where women earn less than men on average, is a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors:

**1. Occupational Segregation**

Women often work in industries and roles that traditionally offer lower pay. Fields such as teaching, nursing, and social work, predominantly occupied by women, tend to have lower salaries compared to male-dominated sectors like engineering and technology. This segregation limits women's earning potential. ([salary.com](https://www.salary.com/blog/the-gender-pay-gap-why-women-earn-less/?utm_source=openai))

**2. Societal Norms and Gender Roles**

Traditional gender roles often assign women the primary responsibility for caregiving and household duties. This expectation can lead women to seek flexible or part-time employment, which typically offers lower wages and fewer advancement opportunities. Additionally, societal biases may undervalue work traditionally performed by women, contributing to lower pay in these roles.

**3. Educational and Career Choices**

While women have made significant strides in education, they often choose majors and careers that lead to lower-paying jobs. For instance, women are more likely to pursue degrees in education and social sciences, whereas men dominate higher-paying fields like engineering and computer science. These choices, influenced by societal expectations and norms, impact earning potential. ([salary.com](https://www.salary.com/blog/the-gender-pay-gap-why-women-earn-less/?utm_source=openai))

**4. Motherhood Penalty**

Becoming a mother can negatively affect a woman's earnings. Mothers often face wage reductions, diminished perceived competence, and fewer career advancement opportunities compared to their childless counterparts. This "motherhood penalty" exacerbates the gender pay gap. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty?utm_source=openai))

**5. Discrimination and Bias**

Despite equal qualifications and experience, women may face discrimination in hiring, promotions, and salary negotiations. Implicit biases can lead to women being perceived as less competent or committed, affecting their career progression and earnings. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/money/gender-wage-gap-explained?utm_source=openai))

**6. Negotiation and Confidence Gap**

Women are less likely to negotiate salaries, raises, and promotions, contributing to lower pay compared to men. Cultural biases discourage women from assertive negotiation, as they may face backlash for not being "likable."

Addressing the gender pay gap requires a multifaceted approach, including promoting gender-neutral career guidance, implementing equitable workplace policies, and challenging societal norms that perpetuate disparities.
