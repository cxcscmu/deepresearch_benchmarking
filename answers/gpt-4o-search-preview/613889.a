Men commit crimes at higher rates than women due to a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.

**Biological Factors:**

- **Resting Heart Rate:** Research indicates that men generally have lower resting heart rates than women, which has been linked to higher propensities for risk-taking and aggressive behaviors. This physiological trait may partially explain the increased likelihood of men engaging in criminal activities.

- **Neurobiological Differences:** Studies have found that sex differences in antisocial behavior are significantly reduced when controlling for variations in the grey matter of the orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that neurobiological factors contribute to the disparity in criminal behavior between genders.

**Psychological Factors:**

- **Social Cognitive Skills:** Females tend to develop social cognitive skills earlier and more effectively than males, leading to better prosocial behaviors and decision-making. This advantage may contribute to lower rates of criminal behavior among women. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178904000618?utm_source=openai))

- **Personality Disorders:** Men are more frequently diagnosed with antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders, which are associated with higher incidences of criminal and antisocial behavior. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime?utm_source=openai))

**Social and Cultural Factors:**

- **Gender Socialization:** Traditional gender roles often encourage assertiveness and risk-taking in males, while promoting nurturing and compliance in females. These socialization patterns can lead to higher engagement in criminal activities among men.

- **Peer Influence:** Males are more likely to associate with delinquent peers, which significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. In contrast, females' delinquency is less influenced by peer associations. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency?utm_source=openai))

- **Family Structure:** The power-control theory suggests that family dynamics influence delinquency rates. In patriarchal families, boys experience less supervision, leading to higher delinquency rates compared to girls. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-control_theory_of_gender_and_delinquency?utm_source=openai))

These factors collectively contribute to the observed higher rates of criminal behavior among men compared to women.
