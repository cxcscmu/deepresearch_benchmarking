Gasoline prices in the United States have risen significantly due to a combination of recent trade policies and market dynamics.

**Trade Policies and Tariffs**

In early 2025, the U.S. government implemented a series of tariffs affecting key trading partners:

- **Canada and Mexico**: On February 1, 2025, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on most goods from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff specifically on Canadian oil and energy exports. These tariffs took effect on April 3, 2025. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_trade_war_with_Canada_and_Mexico?utm_source=openai))

- **China**: The U.S. escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, raising them to an effective 145% after April 9, 2025. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_second_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))

These tariffs have disrupted supply chains and increased costs for imported goods, including crude oil and refined petroleum products. The 10% tariff on Canadian oil, a major source for U.S. refineries, has directly contributed to higher gasoline prices. Economists have warned that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and economic disruptions.

**Market Dynamics**

The trade tensions have also influenced global oil markets:

- **Oil Prices**: On April 16, 2025, Brent crude was priced at $64.49 per barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate at $61.17. These prices reflect market uncertainties stemming from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and its potential negative effects on global economic growth and energy demand.

- **U.S. Oil Production**: Despite efforts to boost domestic production, U.S. energy companies have reduced the number of active oil rigs. As of April 11, 2025, the U.S. oil rig count fell by nine, marking the largest single-week decline since June 2023. This reduction is attributed to lower oil prices and increased costs due to tariffs on imported equipment.

In summary, the recent surge in U.S. gasoline prices is primarily driven by the implementation of tariffs on key trading partners, leading to increased import costs and market uncertainties. These factors have collectively contributed to higher prices at the pump for consumers.
