World War II (1939–1945) is widely regarded as a justified conflict, particularly from the perspective of the Allied powers. The war was initiated by aggressive actions from Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—who pursued expansionist policies that violated international agreements and threatened global stability.

**Justifications for the Allied Involvement:**

1. **Aggression by Axis Powers:** Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, followed by rapid conquests across Europe, and Japan's expansion in Asia, including the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, compelled the Allies to respond militarily to halt further aggression.

2. **Defense of Sovereignty and Human Rights:** The Axis powers' actions, including the Holocaust and other war crimes, posed severe threats to human rights and national sovereignties, necessitating intervention to prevent further atrocities.

3. **Global Security and Stability:** The expansionist policies of the Axis threatened international peace, prompting the Allies to act to restore and maintain global stability.

**Public Perception and Ethical Considerations:**

In the United States, public opinion has historically supported the nation's involvement in World War II. A YouGov poll indicated that 66% of Americans believed the U.S. role in the war was justified, with only 14% dissenting.

However, certain actions during the war, such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have sparked ethical debates. Some scholars argue these bombings constituted acts of "war terrorism," targeting civilians to achieve political ends.

In summary, while the Allied response to Axis aggression is broadly viewed as justified, specific wartime actions continue to be subjects of ethical scrutiny and debate.
