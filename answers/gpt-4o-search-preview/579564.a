The debate over the removal of Confederate statues centers on their historical context, the messages they convey, and their impact on contemporary society. Here are key reasons supporting their removal:

**1. Glorification of a Racist Past**

Many Confederate monuments were erected during periods when white supremacist ideologies were prevalent, particularly between the 1880s and 1920s. These statues often serve to honor individuals who fought to preserve slavery and seceded from the United States. Their presence can be seen as an endorsement of these values, which contradict the principles of equality and justice. ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/procon/historical-statue-removal-debate?utm_source=openai))

**2. Perpetuation of White Supremacy**

The construction of these monuments was frequently part of organized efforts to promote white supremacy and intimidate Black communities. Their continued presence in public spaces can reinforce systemic racism and serve as painful reminders of oppression.

**3. Misrepresentation of History**

Confederate statues often present a distorted view of history by venerating figures who fought against the United States. This can lead to a misunderstanding of the Civil War's causes and consequences, hindering efforts to confront and learn from the nation's past.

**4. Hindrance to Community Healing**

The presence of these monuments can impede efforts to heal racial divisions by symbolizing a legacy of oppression. Removing them can be a step toward acknowledging past injustices and fostering a more inclusive society.

**5. Alignment with Founding Ideals**

The United States was founded on principles of liberty and equality. Monuments that honor those who fought to uphold slavery are inconsistent with these ideals. Their removal can be seen as an effort to align public symbols with the nation's core values. ([time.com](https://time.com/4905956/ray-mabus-confederate-statues-trump/?utm_source=openai))

In summary, the removal of Confederate statues is advocated to prevent the glorification of a racist past, dismantle symbols of white supremacy, correct historical misrepresentations, promote community healing, and uphold the foundational ideals of the United States.
