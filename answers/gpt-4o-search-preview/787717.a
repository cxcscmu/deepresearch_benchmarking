The legality of abortion in the United States has evolved significantly over time, shaped by landmark judicial decisions and legislative actions.

**Historical Context:**

In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in *Roe v. Wade* established that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government interference. This ruling effectively legalized abortion nationwide, asserting that the right to privacy encompassed a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade?utm_source=openai))

However, in June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade* in the case of *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. This decision concluded that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, thereby returning the authority to regulate abortion to individual states.

**Current Legal Landscape:**

As a result of the *Dobbs* decision, abortion laws now vary by state:

- **States Where Abortion Remains Legal:** Some states have enacted laws or constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights. For instance, California allows abortions up to the point of fetal viability and has enshrined reproductive rights in its state constitution. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law_in_the_United_States_by_state?utm_source=openai))

- **States with Restrictions or Bans:** Other states have implemented restrictive measures or total bans on abortion. For example, Arkansas prohibits abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions.

**Ongoing Legal Challenges:**

The shifting legal environment has led to numerous legal challenges. In Wyoming, the Supreme Court is reviewing arguments concerning abortion laws that were previously blocked by a lower court. These laws include a near-total ban on abortion and a specific prohibition on abortion pills. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0c3cbe5952bbc29dfeda9c0fb82e22c6?utm_source=openai))

In summary, the legality of abortion in the United States is now determined by individual state laws, resulting in a diverse and complex legal landscape across the country.
