George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' serves as an allegory of the Russian Revolution and critiques the corrupting influence of power in political systems. It portrays the downfall of revolutionary ideals and the betrayal of the working class by those who seize authority.

#### 2. Key Themes
1. **Corruption of Ideals:**
   Initially, the animals strive for equality post-rebellion, but power soon corrupts their noble goals, epitomized by Napoleon's mantra that "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."

2. **Manipulation and Propaganda:**
   Squealer, as Minister of Propaganda, exemplifies how language can be manipulated to serve the interests of the ruling class, convincing the animals that certain privileges for pigs are for their collective benefit.

3. **Power Dynamics:**
   The pigs' gradual accumulation of power mirrors totalitarian regimes, reflecting how revolutionary ideals can morph into oppression.

#### 3. Key Symbols
1. **The Pigs:**
   Representing the ruling elite, the pigs' betrayal of Animalism reflects the difference between revolutionary promises and authoritarian reality.

2. **Boxer:**
   A symbol of the hardworking proletariat, Boxer's loyalty leads to his tragic demise, highlighting how the dedicated working class is often exploited by those in power.

3. **The Windmill:**
   Initially a symbol of hope, it becomes a tool of oppression, representing how the promise of progress is used to manipulate and exploit the labor of the animals.

#### 4. Specific Examples
- Napoleon uses dogs to expel Snowball, demonstrating fear as a means of control.
