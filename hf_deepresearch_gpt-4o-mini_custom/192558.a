### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Brexit vote in June 2016, where 52% of UK voters chose to leave the EU, was influenced by a variety of factors including immigration concerns, economic perceptions, demographic divisions, emotional appeals regarding sovereignty, and dissatisfaction with the EU governance.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The outcome of the Brexit referendum reflected complex motivations:  
- **Immigration Concerns**: A significant voter anxiety over immigration and EU policies drove support for Brexit. Many believed EU membership negatively affected job opportunities and public services.
- **Economic Perceptions**: Voters were split on the economic implications of leaving. While some believed Brexit would allow for more favorable trade agreements and regulatory autonomy, others expressed concern about potential negative economic impacts.
- **Demographics**: The Leave vote was characterized by notable demographic trends, with older, less educated, and lower-income individuals more likely to support leaving, whereas younger, more educated, and affluent voters tended to favor remaining in the EU.
- **Emotional Appeals**: A strong desire for national sovereignty influenced voters' decisions, as slogans like "Take Back Control" resonated with those feeling alienated by the EU's bureaucratic processes.
- **Regional Differences**: Voting patterns exhibited geographic divides, with urban areas more likely to support Remain and rural areas leaning towards Leave.
Context from the British Election Study also revealed that Leave voters generally exhibited lower trust in experts and higher feelings of nostalgia compared to Remainers, illustrating broader socio-economic and psychological divides.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The analysis of the Brexit vote provides insights into deeper social dynamics and helps explain ongoing political sentiments within the UK. It highlights how demographic characteristics, economic concerns, and emotional considerations can shape significant electoral outcomes, indicating potential long-term implications for UK-EU relations and future political alignments.
