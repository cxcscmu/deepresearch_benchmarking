### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Wealthy individuals and corporations employ various tax avoidance strategies that include buying assets, borrowing against them, and benefiting from provisions like the step-up in basis at death.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Overview of Tax Avoidance Strategies**
- **Buy Assets**: Wealthy individuals often purchase appreciating assets (real estate, stocks). These assets are not taxed until sold.

- **Borrow Against Assets**: Rather than selling assets to access cash, the wealthy take loans against the value of these assets, avoiding taxes on realized gains as loans are not taxable.

- **Die Without Realizing Gains**: Upon death, the assets can be transferred to heirs at their current market value due to the step-up in basis, thus avoiding capital gains taxes that would have been due had the original owner sold the assets during their lifetime.

**Conclusion**: These methods allow the ultra-wealthy to accumulate and transfer wealth drastically reducing their tax liabilities, showcasing substantial disparities within the tax system that benefit affluent individuals disproportionately.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The "Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy encapsulates a systemic issue within the U.S. taxation framework, which benefits those with significant financial means, allowing them to evade paying taxes regularly owed by middle and lower income individuals. The discussion surrounding these strategies often leads to debates on needed tax reforms.
