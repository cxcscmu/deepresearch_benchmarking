### 2. Task Outcome (Extremely Detailed Version)
Police investigations are structured into various methodologies and phases to effectively address a wide array of criminal activities.

1. **Types of Crimes:**  
- **Homicide:** Investigations involve meticulous scene management, evidence collection, and forensic analysis. Techniques such as autopsy reviews, toxicology testing, and witness interviews are integral. Detectives often use profiling methods and interrogative techniques to identify suspects. 
- **Robbery:** Officers approaching robbery scenes must be aware of potential threats and should prioritize the safety of victims. Initial actions include securing the scene, collecting evidence, and obtaining descriptions of suspects and vehicles. Investigative techniques may involve reviewing surveillance footage, interviewing witnesses, and analyzing patterns of previous similar crimes.
- **Cybercrime:** The rise of digital offenses requires specialized knowledge for handling virtual crime scenes. Investigators must understand how to preserve digital evidence, utilize network forensics, and track online activities through IP address tracing and metadata analysis. Specific tools such as antivirus software and data recovery applications may be employed during investigations.

2. **Investigation Process:**  
- **Instigation:** This initial phase may begin with a call to law enforcement. The officer assesses the situation, prioritizes immediate actions, and organizes response efforts.
- **Investigation Phases:**  
    - *Initial Investigation:* Officers conduct immediate actions such as securing the scene and assisting any injured individuals.
