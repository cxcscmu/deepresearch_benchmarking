Racism has changed significantly over time, evolving from overt and legalized forms to more subtle expressions characterized by unconscious bias. Key historical events include the Atlantic Slave Trade and the Civil Rights Movement, while contemporary statistics reveal a persistent belief in systemic discrimination against racial minorities. Recent data show that while public sentiment acknowledges the existence of racism, there is a declining optimism about progress in combating these issues. Movements such as the Civil Rights Act have led to substantial reforms, but challenges remain in achieving true equity and social justice.
