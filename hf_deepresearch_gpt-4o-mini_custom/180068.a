### Report on Human Contributions to Global Warming

#### 1. Introduction
Human activities have significantly impacted the climate, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions. The continuous rise in these emissions correlates with industrial growth, urbanization, and changes in land use over the years.

#### 2. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Overview
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions**: As of 2021, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels were projected to be approximately **36.4 gigatons (Gt)**. This represents a substantial rebound of **4.9%** from 2020, when emissions temporarily declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Methane (CH4) Emissions**: Methane continues to rank as the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A significant portion stems from the oil and gas industry, with approximately **82 million tons** (equivalent to about **2.5 Gt** of CO2) emitted in 2019.

#### 3. Key Human Activities Contributing to Global Warming
- **Fossil Fuel Combustion**: The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is the largest source of CO2 emissions.
- **Agricultural Practices**: Agricultural activities, especially livestock production, contribute significantly to methane emissions.
- **Deforestation**: Land use change, particularly deforestation, reduces the number of trees available to sequester carbon dioxide, exacerbating climate issues.

#### 4. Implications and Actions
The rise in greenhouse gas concentrations has significant implications for climate stability, urging the need for robust policies aimed at emission reductions. Initiatives such as the **Global Methane Pledge** seek to curb methane emissions by **30%** by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.

#### 5. Conclusion
Addressing human contributions to global warming is crucial for mitigating climate change impacts. Transitioning towards sustainable practices, enforcing regulations on emissions, and investing in renewable energy sources will be pivotal in combatting the ongoing climate crisis.
