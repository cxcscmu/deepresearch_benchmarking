### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The search produced detailed information on hostile work environments according to the EEOC, outlining definitions, criteria for complaints, and filing procedures.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines a hostile work environment as one that is considered discriminatory due to pervasive or severe misconduct based on protected traits, such as race, gender, age, or disability. This environment must be established through consistent and significant harassment that would cause a reasonable person to find it intimidating or abusive. 

Employees who believe they are experiencing a hostile work environment must first report the issue to their HR department. If the HR department does not address the complaint satisfactorily, then the employee may escalate the issue to the EEOC, which is charged with enforcing anti-discrimination laws in workplaces. 

Key federal laws enforced by the EEOC include:
- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
- The Pregnancy Discrimination Act
- The Equal Pay Act
- The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
- The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)

The EEOC has the authority to investigate these complaints, hold hearings, and issue rulings on discrimination claims. Outcomes could include settlements and recommendations for policy changes within the offending organization.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The determination of what constitutes a hostile work environment is not based on isolated incidents of discomfort; rather, it needs to involve a pattern of abusive behavior. Annoying behavior or isolated comments typically do not qualify unless they create a pervasive issue. Understanding the legal framework around workplace hostilities is crucial for both the complainant and the employer to know their rights and responsibilities under federal law.
