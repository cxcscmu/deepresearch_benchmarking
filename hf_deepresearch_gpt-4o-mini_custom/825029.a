#### 2. Age-Specific Strategies for Enhancing Emotional Intelligence
Strategies for enhancing emotional intelligence vary by age, promoting emotional awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and interpersonal skills from infancy through adolescence.

- **Infants (0-12 months)**: Responsive caregiving and emotional modeling are key in helping infants learn about emotional expression and regulation.
