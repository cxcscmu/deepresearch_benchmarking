The causes of sexism are defined by discriminatory practices and historical biases that have evolved through various feminist movements. Key causes include hostile and benevolent sexism forms, psychological biases, and societal expectations, perpetuated by systemic inequalities. Modern studies indicate that these practices significantly impact women's mental health and societal roles. Effective interventions like managerial programs, grassroots movements, and gender-transformative policies are necessary to dismantle these issues.
