   - **Organizational Analysis**: Assessing internal capabilities to leverage strengths and improve weaknesses aligns with long-term growth.

2. **Short-Term Activities:**
   - **Performance Management**: Involves monitoring and adjusting short-term objectives to ensure alignment with long-term goals.
   - **Immediate Adaptations**: Short-term strategies to tackle pressing challenges based on environmental changes.

### 3. Examples from Case Studies
