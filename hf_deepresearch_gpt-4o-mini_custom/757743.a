### Task outcome (short version):
The Radical Republicans disapproved of presidential reconstruction due to Andrew Johnson's lenient policies towards the South, which allowed former Confederates to regain power and led to the enactment of restrictive Black Codes that severely limited the rights of African Americans.

### Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Radical Republicans were firmly opposed to Andrew Johnson’s presidential reconstruction for several key reasons:

1. **Leniency Toward Confederates**: Johnson’s policies allowed many former Confederate leaders to return to positions of power without adequate punishment or accountability for their actions during the Civil War. The Radical Republicans felt this leniency ignored the principles of justice and undermined the sacrifices made to preserve the Union.

2. **Black Codes**: The creation of Black Codes by Southern legislatures under Johnson's watch severely restricted the freedoms and rights of African Americans, aiming to force them back into economic dependency similar to slavery. These laws prohibited blacks from voting, owning property in certain areas, and testifying against whites in court, which were seen as clear attempts to maintain white supremacy.

3. **Lack of Federal Intervention**: Johnson's approach favored state autonomy and minimal federal intervention, which did not align with the Radical Republicans' view that federal action was necessary to secure the rights of freedmen. They believed in actively using federal power to protect and ensure civil rights.

4. **Political Struggle**: This opposition was also rooted in a broader political struggle. The Radical Republicans sought to reshape Southern society and protect the rights of newly freed African Americans, opposing any swift return to power for those who had led the Confederacy.

Ultimately, these disagreements escalated tensions in Congress and culminated in Johnson’s impeachment.

### Additional context (if relevant):
The impact of Johnson’s leniency and the enactment of Black Codes perpetuated systemic racism in America, setting the stage for decades of discrimination and the establishment of Jim Crow laws, which further marginalized African Americans long after the Reconstruction era.
