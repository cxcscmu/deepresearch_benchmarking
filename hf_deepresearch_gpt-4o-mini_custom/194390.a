### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The recent studies from IPCC and NASA highlight that global warming has significant and immediate environmental impacts, emphasizing the urgency for mitigation efforts to prevent crossing critical temperature thresholds.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **IPCC Findings:** The IPCC's latest assessments indicate that we are likely to breach the 1.5°C limit within the next one to three decades without substantial emission reductions. Reports emphasize that global net-zero emissions by 2050 is essential to limit temperature rise effectively. Persistent warming has already caused observable impacts, such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, loss of glaciers, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss across ecosystems. The IPCC is particularly concerned about the disproportionate effects on vulnerable populations in small island states and less affluent countries.

- **NASA Findings:** NASA has corroborated these findings, providing data showing that the Arctic sea ice extent has decreased by approximately 13% per decade since 1979, and global temperatures have increased by 1.01°C since 1880. Key data include:
   - Sea level rise of approximately 3.94 inches since 1993.
   - Carbon dioxide levels reaching 417 parts per million.
   - Significant ocean heat added, estimated at 337 zettajoules since 1955.
These metrics make clear the continuing and accelerating pace of climate change and its direct link to human activity.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Both IPCC and NASA stress that immediate action is imperative to mitigate further damage to the planet and to transition to sustainable practices. Climate change is not a distant concern but a current crisis affecting weather patterns, water supply, and food security globally.
