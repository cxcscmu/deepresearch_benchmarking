## Structured Report on How World War II Ended the Great Depression

### Introduction
The Great Depression (1929-1939) was marked by severe economic stagnation in the United States. Unemployment peaked at 25%, while GDP suffered significant contractions. The onset of World War II in 1939 catalyzed the recovery from this economic downturn.

### 1. Mobilization and Industrial Changes
- As war production ramped up, factories shifted from consumer goods to military supplies.
- Unemployment dropped from around 25% in the Great Depression to approximately 10% by 1941.

### 2. GDP Growth and Economic Output
- U.S. GDP grew from about $100 billion in 1940 to over $200 billion by 1945, driven largely by military spending.
- Major sectors like manufacturing, aviation, and textiles experienced unprecedented growth.

### 3. Labor Market Transformation
- The war effort led to a significant influx of women into the workforce, challenging pre-existing gender roles and changing societal dynamics.

### 4. Post-War Economic Changes
- Following the war, consumer demand surged, leading to continued economic prosperity. 
- The GI Bill and other federal programs stimulated the economy by promoting education and home ownership for returning veterans.

### 5. Long-term Implications
- The collaborative efforts during the war set a precedent for government involvement in economic policies, influencing future economic stability.

### Conclusion
World War II was not only a military conflict but also a pivotal turning point for the U.S. economy. The war catalyzed a transformation in industrial capacity, significantly reduced unemployment, and increased GDP, ultimately ending the Great Depression. The impacts of this period laid the groundwork for the subsequent economic expansion known as the Golden Age of Capitalism.
