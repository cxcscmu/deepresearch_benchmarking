### 1. Current Statistics
As of the 119th Congress (2025-2027), there are currently 151 women serving in Congress: 
26 in the Senate and 125 in the House of Representatives, totaling about 27% representation.

### 2. Historical Trends
Women's representation in the U.S. Congress has gradually increased from Jeannette Rankin's election in 1917 as the first woman in Congress to 151 women currently in office. Key milestones include:
- 1970: Only 11 women served in Congress.
- 1992: The "Year of the Woman"; representation doubled to 47.
- 2019: 107 women reached office.
- 2021: Continued growth with 144 women elected.

### 3. Barriers to Representation
Several barriers contribute to the low representation of women in Congress:
- **Societal Norms:** Persistent stereotypes about women's leadership abilities.
- **Political Party Dynamics:** Challenges in recruiting women candidates by political parties.
- **Electoral Challenges:** Structural issues with electoral systems that favor male candidates.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Difficulties in managing multifaceted responsibilities for women.
- **Historical Context:** Ongoing discrepancies in political representation compared to women's increasing roles in other sectors.

### 4. Conclusion
While there has been significant progress in women's representation in Congress, systemic barriers remain. Strategies such as improved recruitment practices for women by political parties, reforms to support work-life balance, and addressing societal biases can help increase women's participation in legislative roles in the future.
