### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The search for academic articles regarding the psychological and social effects of social media highlights both negative and positive implications on mental health. Many studies indicate that social media use can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and cyberbullying among youths. Conversely, when used to foster genuine social interactions, social media can positively impact psychological well-being.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In examining the psychological and social effects of social media, numerous studies provide a comprehensive insight into its dual nature:
- **Negative Effects:**
  - A review titled "Effects of Social Media on Mental Health" by Bashir & Bhat reveals a strong correlation between social media usage and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, particularly among young people. The rise of cyberbullying has exacerbated these issues, contributing to a burgeoning public health concern.
  - Research conducted by the American Psychological Association discusses how social media impacts psychological well-being, often linking excessive use to feelings of loneliness, depression, and dissatisfaction with life. It suggests that these negative outcomes do not necessarily mean social media is the sole cause, indicating a complex relationship between usage patterns and mental health.

- **Positive Effects:**
  - A study from the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School shows that social media can enhance psychological well-being when used for genuine social interactions, like engaging with close friends and family. Non-genuine interactions, however, such as following influencers or consuming news, do not contribute to increased happiness.
  - An analysis by Odgers and Jensen from the University of North Carolina calls attention to how the focus has been predominantly on negative effects, suggesting that leveraging social media can potentially support mental health and well-being if utilized positively.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The ongoing dialogue about the effects of social media highlights the necessity for balanced perspectives—considering both harms and benefits. As adolescents increasingly engage with social media, understanding these impacts becomes critical for developing strategies that promote positive mental health outcomes. Further, a continual examination of new research is vital as the digital landscape evolves, shifting how young individuals interact with technology and each other.
