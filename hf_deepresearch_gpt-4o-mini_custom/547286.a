### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Research indicates that both genetic and environmental factors significantly influence intelligence. Genetic factors account for about 20-40% of IQ variance in childhood and increase to 80% in adulthood. Environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and educational access, also play vital roles in shaping intellectual potential.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Recent studies underscore a crucial interaction between genetic and environmental factors in determining intelligence. Research conducted by Turkheimer et al. in 2003 found that in underprivileged settings, shared environmental influences can account for up to 60% of the variance in IQ. This indicates that children growing up in impoverished environments face barriers that may inhibit the realization of their genetic potential.

Multiple studies highlight that intelligence is not determined by a single gene; rather, it arises from complex interactions among numerous genes influenced by environmental conditions. Factors like maternal age, prenatal exposure to harmful substances, and access to education influence cognitive outcomes.

Furthermore, the heritability of IQ reflects genetic contributions varying across different demographics and environmental settings; in high-quality environments, genetic factors exhibit more influence on intelligence than in lower-quality ones. Research suggests environments rich in learning opportunities and healthy development significantly enhance IQ scores, demonstrating that education and social support are critical allied factors that work with innate potential.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The debate on nature vs. nurture continues, with contemporary psychology recognizing the need to consider both genetic and environmental influences on intelligence. The increasing emphasis on educational policies and interventions suggests that while genetics establish potential, nurturing and improved socio-environmental contexts can greatly ameliorate cognitive development and outcomes.
