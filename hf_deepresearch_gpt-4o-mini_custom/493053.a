### 1. Task outcome (short version):
In April 2023, natural gas prices are forecasted to average around $4.30 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), reflecting a significant increase from previous years.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The trends for natural gas prices in April 2023 indicate an upward trajectory, driven primarily by a combination of increased demand and limited supply, influenced by colder-than-normal temperatures impacting consumption patterns. The expected average price at Henry Hub for Q2 of 2025 is projected to be over $3.90/MMBtu, which marks an approximately 90% increase from the same period in 2024. This upward shift can be attributed to stronger domestic and export demand, pushing the forecast for average prices in 2025 to around $4.30/MMBtu and further rising to nearly $4.60/MMBtu in 2026. The anticipated increase in LNG exports, set to rise significantly due to the commencement of new export facilities, also plays a critical role in shaping these price trends.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The document presented is a Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It outlines key forecasts and analyses related to energy demand, production, and pricing, especially focusing on natural gas. The most relevant sections highlighted the interplay between weather patterns, consumption trends in the residential and commercial sectors, and the contributions of LNG exports to overall demand. This comprehensive overview indicates that the natural gas market is experiencing shifts not just in pricing but also in structural dynamics due to geopolitical influences and fluctuating market demands. The direction of these prices is essential for stakeholders in the energy sector and those involved in related industries, as they reflect market conditions that might dictate future investments and policy decisions.
