Major ethical theories shaping personal ethical standards include utilitarianism, deontology, social justice theory, and virtue ethics.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):

- **Utilitarianism**: This theory posits that the moral worth of an action is determined by its contribution to overall utility, maximizing happiness while minimizing pain. Developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, utilitarianism divides into "act" (judging individual actions) and "rule" (based on rules leading to the greatest good). The implications are significant in policy-making and business decisions but can lead to conflicts regarding minority rights.

- **Deontology**: Introduced by Immanuel Kant, this theory suggests morality is based on adherence to rules rather than consequences. Key principles include universalizability and reversibility. Ethical dilemmas arise when conflicting duties challenge practical application.

- **Social Justice and Social Contract Theory**: This theory focuses on fairness in resource distribution and the ethical responsibilities of individuals and organizations toward societal welfare. Influential figures like Thomas Hobbes highlighted agreements for social order, emphasizing responsibilities in promoting equity.

- **Virtue Ethics**: Rooted in Aristotle’s teachings, it emphasizes the development of character traits like honesty and courage. Rather than just rules or outcomes, it promotes ethical action arising from one’s virtues, advocating for leadership and cultures that prioritize intrinsic moral values.
