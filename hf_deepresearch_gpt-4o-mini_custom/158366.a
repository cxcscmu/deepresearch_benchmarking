### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The biological mechanisms of aging are influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices, each playing a critical role in determining individual longevity and health.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **Genetics:** Genetics account for approximately 25% to 35% of the variation in human longevity. Key genes associated with aging include **APOE** and **FOXO3A**. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic loci linked to aging biomarkers, particularly those related to DNA methylation and longevity.

- **Environmental Factors:** Environmental exposures, such as pollution and toxins, can increase the risk of age-associated diseases and influence the overall aging process. Research indicates that eliminating harmful environmental factors could improve life quality and longevity. Factors like **air pollution** significantly impact aging processes and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality among older adults.

- **Lifestyle Factors:** Positive lifestyle choices are crucial for promoting healthy aging. Regular **exercise**, a balanced **diet**, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding substances like **tobacco** and excessive **alcohol** are all associated with increased lifespan. Moreover, psychological and social factors, including social interaction and emotional well-being, also influence aging.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle is complex and multifaceted. Continued research is essential to uncover how these factors interact and contribute to various aging outcomes. Identification of biomarkers and genetic variants linked to healthy aging provides a fertile ground for future studies aiming to enhance longevity and quality of life.
