### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Protestant Reformation (1517-1648) dramatically altered the European religious landscape, leading to the establishment of various Protestant denominations and significant changes in the biblical canon. Martin Luther's translation of the Bible shaped the Protestant understanding, rejecting certain books and calling others into question. In contrast, the Catholic Church reaffirmed its canon at the Council of Trent (1546), which solidified the authority of specific texts, including the deuterocanonical books, and established the Latin Vulgate as the authorized version for the Catholic faith.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Protestant Reformation was a major religious movement during the 16th century that sought to reform the Catholic Church and resulted in various Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Anglicanism. Key figures like Martin Luther challenged the Church's authority, focusing on issues such as the sale of indulgences and the interpretation of scripture.

Luther's pivotal action in 1517, when he published his 95 Theses, sparked widespread debate and unrest. His insistence on 'sola scriptura' (scripture alone) emphasized that the Bible, not Church traditions or clergy, was the ultimate authority in Christianity. In Luther's 1534 Bible translation, he notably included but minimized the deuterocanonical books, positioning them as 'Apocrypha'â€”texts that were useful but not equal to canonical scripture. Additionally, he categorized several New Testament texts as 'disputed books', questioning their divine inspiration, especially Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation.

John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, other prominent reformers, shared a similar view by placing the authority of scripture above human traditions; however, they maintained different emphases in their teachings. Throughout the Reformation, the printing press facilitated the rapid spread of Reformation literature, allowing for personal interpretations of scripture and significantly weakening the Catholic Church's monopoly on biblical texts.

In response to these challenges, the Catholic Church convened the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563, which formally established the Church's canon. This council affirmed the inclusion of the deuterocanonical books and enforced the Latin Vulgate as the authoritative biblical text. Key decisions from the Council affirmed the sacredness of both scripture and tradition and imposed anathemas against those who rejected the canon as defined.

The Council's decisions not only defined the biblical canon for the Catholic Church but also deeply influenced the theological divide that exists between Catholicism and Protestantism today. The reaffirmation of certain texts rejected by Protestants solidified Catholic doctrine and teaching, emphasizing the Church's role in guiding the interpretation of scripture.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The decisions made during the Council of Trent were a significant political and theological response to the Protestant Reformation. They addressed not just doctrinal concerns but showed the Catholic Church's commitment to maintaining its authority and unity in the face of reformative movements. The ramifications of these decisions continue to shape Christian theology and biblical interpretation to this day.
