### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of climate change on health is profound, causing an estimated 250,000 additional deaths annually from various health issues between 2030 and 2050, with significant economic costs associated with health damage and adaptation efforts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change significantly affects the fundamental social and environmental determinants of health, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Key factors impacted include clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and adequate shelter. Specifically, it is projected that climate change will result in approximately 250,000 additional deaths each year between 2030 and 2050 due to causes such as malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress. The direct costs to health are estimated to reach between USD 2-4 billion annually by 2030.

Adaptation strategies are crucial for mitigating these impacts. The WHO provides several resources to assess and address health vulnerabilities associated with climate change. Tools have been developed that guide the estimation of health damage costs, adaptation costs across sectors, and the efficiency of different adaptation measures.

Furthermore, the WHO emphasizes the importance of assessing vulnerability and implementing comprehensive adaptation strategies. For instance, the assessment methods consider various health outcomes affected by climate change, such as morbidity and mortality due to heatwaves, air pollution, and water- and food-borne diseases, which are projected to worsen under climate scenarios.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The health impacts of climate change may differ across populations, influenced by factors such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Developing countries, in particular, face greater challenges due to weaker health infrastructure and limited resources for climate adaptation. Therefore, coordinated international responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance public health infrastructure are critical in mitigating the risk associated with climate change.
