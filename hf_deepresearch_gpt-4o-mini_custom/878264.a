### Final Report: Should Students Consider Staying in Their Home State for University Education?

#### 1. Enrollment and Graduation Rates

#### 2. Tuition Costs
- **In-state tuition** averages around **$9,410** annually in 2023, making it significantly more affordable for resident students.
- **Out-of-state tuition** costs average approximately **$23,890** per year, resulting in a financial burden that can exceed **$14,000** more than that of in-state peers.

#### 3. Employment Rates
- The overall employment rate for college graduates is around **79%**.
- Graduates from in-state universities often find local job markets more accessible, which can contribute to faster and potentially higher employment post-graduation compared to out-of-state graduates.

#### 4. Student Satisfaction

- While **out-of-state universities** offer prestigious programs, they often involve higher costs that can affect student satisfaction. New environments can introduce challenges for acclimation and lead to mixed reviews about the overall educational experience.

#### 5. Additional Context

- Out-of-state students may gain varied experiences, such as exposure to new cultural environments, but they must balance this with the financial and logistical challenges of relocating.

#### Conclusion
Based on the collected data, students are advised to weigh both their academic and financial circumstances when considering university options. Statistically, staying in their home state could provide economic advantages, a supportive environment, and improved job prospects. However, personal aspirations and the pursuit of unique academic programs at out-of-state institutions may also guide their decisions.
