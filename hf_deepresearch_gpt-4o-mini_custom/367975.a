### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Animal testing remains a critical component in drug development by providing insights on efficacy and safety, despite concerns over its predictability for human outcomes. Regulatory agencies like the FDA require extensive animal testing data before human trials can commence, emphasizing its perceived necessity.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Animal testing provides crucial data for drug development by assessing pharmacological effects and safety before human trials. Statistics show that approximately 9.6% to 14% of drugs enter the market after clinical trials, indicating considerable challenges despite thorough pre-trial testing. Some studies suggest that many drugs successful in animal tests fail during human trials due to unforeseen effects or inapplicability.

The use of non-animal testing methods is rapidly growing, showing promise for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Innovations utilize human cells, advanced computer models, and genomic techniques to study human-specific responses, with some scientists advocating that these methods could replace harmful animal experiments in the future.

However, substantial regulatory and acceptance barriers still exist for transitioning to these non-animal methods. The acceptance of non-animal alternatives is hindered by a lack of comprehensive validation and the need for regulatory compliance, which has traditionally relied heavily on animal data.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Despite animal testing's historical importance in medical advancements like vaccines and therapeutic drugs, ethical concerns have led to increased scrutiny from the public and scientific community. The conversation surrounding the effectiveness of animal testing versus human-relevant methods is critical as the scientific method evolves, with a clear interest in improving human health outcomes without compromising animal welfare.
