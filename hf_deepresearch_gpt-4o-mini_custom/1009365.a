### Background of the American Civil War

The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, was a devastating conflict primarily caused by a combination of social, economic, and political factors. At the core of the conflict was the institution of slavery, which deeply influenced Southern society and economy.

### Causes of the Civil War

1. **Social Causes**:
   - Slavery was a central issue that created a moral divide between the North, where abolitionist movements grew, and the South, which staunchly defended slavery as essential to its way of life. 
   - Economic disparities were evident; the North was industrializing while the South remained agrarian and dependent on slave labor. 
   - Key events, such as the publication of **Uncle Tom’s Cabin** and incidents like **Bleeding Kansas**, intensified social tensions.

2. **Economic Causes**:
   - The Southern economy relied heavily on agriculture (especially cotton cultivation), which necessitated slave labor, leading to moral and economic conflicts with the North. 
   - The differing economic models fostered resentment and competition between the two regions, exacerbated by legislative decisions regarding the expansion of slavery into new territories.

3. **Political Causes**:
   - Political tensions peaked with events like the **Dred Scott decision**, which ruled that African Americans could not be citizens, further entrenching divisions.
   - The inability of political compromises to address these issues, such as the **Missouri Compromise**, created a breeding ground for sectional animosity and conflict.

### Key Events Leading Up to the Civil War

1. **Missouri Compromise (1820)**:
   - Attempted to maintain balance in Congress between slave and free states, leading to the establishment of the 36°30′ line, thus heightening sectional divisions.

2. **Dred Scott Decision (1857)**:
   - U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not prohibit slavery in territories, thus fueling Northern opposition and hardening Southern stances.

3. **John Brown's Raid (1859)**:
   - An abolitionist attempt to incite a slave insurrection failed but polarized public opinion, branding Brown a martyr for many in the North and a terrorist to many in the South.

### Conclusion

The origins of the Civil War are complex and deeply rooted in a mixture of social, economic, and political disputes. The inability to reconcile differences through peaceful means and the myriad of events that escalated tensions between free and slave states set the stage for the conflict that would redefine the United States.
