### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The causes of anti-science attitudes primarily stem from deep-rooted emotional and psychological needs rather than mere ignorance. Ideology, cognitive biases, and social influences play significant roles in shaping these attitudes.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Recent scholarly articles and research highlight that the rejection of science is complex and influenced by various psychological factors. Key findings include:
- **Emotional and Psychological Needs**: The motivated rejection of science is often linked to fundamental emotional and psychological needs. Individuals may reject scientific consensus on climate change, vaccine safety, and evolution, despite being educated and knowledgeable about these topics.
- **Confirmation Bias**: People frequently exhibit confirmation bias, a cognitive bias where they favor information that supports their pre-existing beliefs. For instance, individuals skeptical of human-caused climate change may dismiss extensive evidence and instead focus on isolated studies that contradict it.
- **Ideological Influences**: Ideology is a significant factor in anti-science attitudes; individuals often align their acceptance or rejection of scientific evidence based on how well it fits within their belief systems. For example, fundamentalist religious beliefs can lead to the rejection of evolution.
- **Selective Acceptance of Facts**: Research indicates that facts supporting personal beliefs are deemed more relevant, while contradicting facts are downplayed or considered less credible. This behavior resembles legal thinking where individuals act more as advocates for their beliefs than as objective evaluators of information.

Overall, attempts to change anti-science attitudes merely through education or facts may be ineffective. Effective strategies must consider emotional resonance and the underlying ideological frameworks driving these beliefs. Engaging in dialogues that address these root causes rather than simply presenting data may yield better outcomes for influencing perspectives on science.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The increasing prevalence of misinformation, especially facilitated by social media and the 'anti-enlightenment' movement, complicates the landscape of public understanding of science. Therefore, developing communication strategies that empathize with individuals' values and emotions is essential for fostering a more scientifically literate society.
