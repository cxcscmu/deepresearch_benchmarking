### 1. Short Answer:
According to the EPA, gasoline combustion results in approximately 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon, while diesel fuel produces about 22.2 pounds of CO2 per gallon. IEA data indicates that well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions for internal combustion engine cars typically range from 150 to 250 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilometer.

### 2. Detailed Analysis:
The average carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline cars are reported to be around 19.6 pounds per gallon, and for diesel cars, the emissions increase to about 22.2 pounds per gallon. The well-to-wheels (WTW) emissions for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are significant, ranging from 150 to 250 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilometer. WTW emissions encompass those from fuel extraction, processing, transportation, and vehicle operation, which indicates a considerable contribution to overall greenhouse gas emissions. Various factors influence these emission numbers, including vehicle efficiency and variation in driving conditions. Itâ€™s noted that ICE vehicles generally emit higher amounts compared to hybrid and electric alternatives, which further underlines their environmental impact. This data emphasizes the necessity for policy interventions aimed at promoting cleaner vehicle alternatives, as the emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles have substantial implications for climate change and air quality.

### 3. Additional Context:
The information provided above was sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). These organizations are central to understanding the environmental impacts of transportation. The results are crucial for informing policy decisions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Awareness of these emissions contributes to the development of regulatory frameworks and encourages consumers to transition towards more sustainable fuel options.
