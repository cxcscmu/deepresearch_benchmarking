### Report: Herbert Hoover's Response to the Bonus Army

#### 1. Background on the Bonus Army
The Bonus Army was formed in 1932 during the Great Depression, comprising approximately 43,000 demonstrators, mainly World War I veterans. They demanded the immediate cash payment of bonus certificates awarded to them in 1924 through the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. This act had stipulated that these bonuses would not be payable until 1945. Facing dire economic conditions, the veterans sought urgent financial support.

#### 2. Hoover's Response
President Herbert Hoover rejected the Bonus Army's demands for early payments, citing concerns over government finances and the potential burden of increased taxation. Despite the initial public sympathy for the veterans, especially amid widespread suffering during the Depression, Hoover ordered the military to disperse the Bonus Army from their camps in Washington, D.C. on July 28, 1932.

The military intervention was led by General Douglas MacArthur, who employed aggressive tactics that included the use of infantry, cavalry, and tanks to remove the protestors. This response resulted in violent clashes, leading to injuries and fatalities, including the death of at least one veteran. The actions of the military further incited public outrage and tarnished Hoover's already fragile reputation. The violence was seen as excessive and highlighted Hoover's failure to empathize with the struggles of the veterans, effectively alienating him from many American citizens.

#### 3. Public Reaction and Political Consequences
Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army significantly damaged his public image. As the demonstrations became more widely covered in the media, public opinion turned sharply against him. Many Americans viewed the veterans' plight as reflective of broader societal issues during the Depression, and Hoover's military response was seen as a failure of leadership.

This incident contributed to Hoover's dramatic decline in approval ratings, culminating in his loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The subsequent scrutiny of government support for veterans eventually led to changes in veterans' policies in the later years.

#### Final Summary
In summary, Herbert Hoover's response to the Bonus Army was marked by a rejection of their demands and a violent military intervention that resulted in public outcry. The incident not only highlighted the economic difficulties faced by veterans amid the Depression but also played a critical role in shaping the political landscape leading into the 1932 election.
