### 1. Introduction to Public Goods
Public goods are defined in economics as products or services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous in consumption. This means that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using the good, and one person's use of the good does not diminish its availability for others.

### 2. Examples of Public Goods
Several clear examples help illustrate the concept of public goods:
- **Clean Air**: Everyone benefits from unpolluted air, which cannot be exclusively owned or charged for.
- **National Defense**: Protection is provided to all citizens, regardless of their individual contributions to defense funding.
- **Public Parks**: Parks are open spaces for recreation that any citizen can enjoy simultaneously without restriction.
- **Street Lighting**: Lights illuminate public areas, benefiting all who use the streets at night.
- **Judiciary and Emergency Services**: These services cannot selectively restrict access; all individuals benefit regardless of their payments.
- **Flood Control Systems**: Protection from floods is a community benefit that does not diminish as more people use the service.

### 3. Market Failure and Public Goods
Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often leading to shortages or excesses. Public goods lead to market failure primarily due to two characteristics:
- **Non-excludability**: Because individuals cannot be excluded from benefiting from public goods, many may choose not to pay, hoping others will cover the costs.
- **Non-rivalry**: Since one individual's consumption does not reduce availability, a free market offers little incentive for producers to sell these goods, resulting in under-provision.

This situation leads to the "free rider problem", where individuals benefit from a good without contributing to its cost, ultimately causing these goods to be underfunded and perhaps not provided at all.

### 4. Conclusion
Public goods are vital for societal well-being, providing essential services. However, due to inherent characteristics leading to the free rider problem, they are often under-provided in a free market. Therefore, governmental intervention is usually required to ensure these goods are supplied and maintained for the benefit of society as a whole.
