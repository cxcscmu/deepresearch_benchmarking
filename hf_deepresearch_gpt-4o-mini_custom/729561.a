### How Social Class Affects Education: An In-Depth Report

#### 1. Definition of Social Class
Social class in sociological terms refers to groups in society that share similar economic, social, and cultural status, typically categorized into upper class, middle class, working class, and lower class based on criteria like income, education, occupation, and wealth.

#### 2. Disparities in Educational Outcomes
- **Graduation Rates**: 
  - Nationwide high school graduation rates reached about 85% in the 2017-2018 school year.
  - However, disparities persist: low-income students face additional barriers, with only about 25% obtaining degrees compared to approximately 90% of their higher socioeconomic peers. 
  - For instance, as of 2015, graduation rates were 77.8% for Hispanic and 74.6% for Black students.

- **Standardized Test Scores**: 
  - Students from lower-income backgrounds perform worse on standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT.
  - Research shows that students eligible for free and reduced-price lunches score significantly lower when compared to their higher-income counterparts.
  
- **College Enrollment Rates**: 
  - Around 51% of recent high school graduates from low-income families enrolled in college as of 2012, with stark disparities seen across racial demographics. In 2019, Asian students showed the highest enrollment rates at 62%, while Black and Hispanic students were at 37% and 36% respectively.

#### 3. Sociological Theories Relevant to Educational Inequality
- **Karl Marx** contended that education serves as a tool for reproducing social class structures and maintaining the status quo within capitalist societies.
- **Max Weber** introduced a multidimensional approach, emphasizing the role of status and power alongside class and noting how educational access correlates with one's social standing.
- **Pierre Bourdieu** highlighted factors such as cultural capital and habitus, explaining how educational systems perpetuate social class distinctions and marginalize lower socio-economic groups.

#### 4. Summary of Current Statistics
- As of the latest available data from 2023, educational disparities remain evident in standardized test performance and college enrollment, with ongoing gaps linked to socioeconomic status and race.
- Reports indicate that low-income students and minority groups disproportionately face challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in education.

#### 5. Conclusion
Advancing educational equity requires systemic reforms aimed at closing the gaps perpetuated by socioeconomic barriers. Policies must focus on providing equal access and resources to marginalized groups to create a more inclusive educational environment.
