### Representation of the American Dream in "The Great Gatsby"

#### Definition and Historical Context
The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States, embodying ideals of democracy, rights, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness through hard work and social mobility. Historically, it has evolved from the individualism of the 19th century to a more complex ideal of prosperity and hope for better life opportunities amid social and economic fluctuations. 

In "The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Fitzgerald critiques the American Dream by illustrating its hollow nature through characters and their pursuits.

#### Key Themes
1. **The American Dream**: The novel critiques the notion that anyone can achieve success through effort. Gatsby’s tragic failure highlights this disillusionment.
2. **Class and Social Stratification**: The settings of East Egg and West Egg represent divides in social class, with the Valley of Ashes symbolizing the struggles of the working class.
3. **Love and Relationships**: Many relationships in the novel are based on illusions, such as Gatsby’s love for Daisy, representing unachievable dreams.
4. **Time**: The theme of the passage of time underscores Gatsby's futile attempts to recreate the past.
5. **Morality and Decay**: The moral decay within the wealthier classes and the corruption of dreams pervade the narrative.

#### Significant Passages
- **The Green Light**: "[H]e stretched out his arms toward the dark water. . . . I . . . distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away." The green light symbolizes Gatsby's unreachable dreams and the illusory nature of the American Dream.

- **Gatsby's Idealism**: "Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge; anything at all..." This reflects the hopeful yet naive belief in boundless possibilities, illustrating the core elements of the American Dream.

- **Gatsby’s Wealth**: "Gatsby, despite his hard work, makes his money illegally by selling alcohol during an era of prohibition." This commentary exposes the corruption underlying the pursuit of wealth.

- **Memory vs. Reality**: Gatsby’s love for Daisy, rooted in his memories, illustrates the unattainability of his dreams and the social divides that persist.

#### Conclusion
Fitzgerald’s portrayal of the American Dream in "The Great Gatsby" serves as a critique of the societal aspirations of 1920s America, revealing the complexities of pursuing dreams against a backdrop of social disparities and moral decay. The characters’ struggles inform us that material success does not guarantee personal fulfillment or happiness.
