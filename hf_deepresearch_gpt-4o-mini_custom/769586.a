Graciela Iturbide, a renowned Mexican photographer, approaches the Kalho Home and Studio site with a deep sense of cultural connection and artistic interpretation. Her work is characterized by her exploration of Indigenous identities and everyday life in Mexico, and this perspective informs her interpretation of the Kalho site. 

The Kalho Home and Studio, being an emblematic location, allows Iturbide to showcase the narrative of Mexican culture, bridging historical contexts with contemporary experiences. Her black-and-white photographs of urban life convey both the vibrancy and challenges faced by the people within these cultural spaces.

Iturbide perceives the Kalho Home and Studio not merely as a physical structure but as a dynamic entity that embodies the complexities of identity and belonging.
