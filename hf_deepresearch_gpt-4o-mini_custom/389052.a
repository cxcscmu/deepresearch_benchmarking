The New Deal redefined the meaning of American freedom by expanding the role of government in economic and social welfare, promoting a shift from a negative to a positive conception of freedom that included economic security as a measure of liberty. The New Deal marked a profound transformation in American life, linking personal liberties to societal welfare and emphasizing the government's role in safeguarding rights and opportunities for all citizens. Its impacts are still felt in contemporary debates about social and economic justice.
