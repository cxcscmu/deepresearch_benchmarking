### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Systems of innovation can be classified into various types based on different dimensions such as geographical scope (national, regional), sectoral focus, and technological orientation. Major frameworks for understanding these systems include the National Innovation System (NIS), the Regional Innovation System (RIS), and Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS). Methodologies used typically involve quantitative techniques, case studies, and network analysis, emphasizing collaboration among various actors like firms, universities, and government institutions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Innovation systems are complex networks that facilitate the flow of information, knowledge, and technology among various actors. Here are the main classifications and frameworks used to understand these systems:

- **National Innovation Systems (NIS)**: This framework emphasizes the importance of country-specific factors, institutions, and policies that influence innovation. It considers elements such as government regulations, funding mechanisms, and the educational system's role in fostering innovation. Key proponents include Freeman, Lundvall, and Nelson.

- **Regional Innovation Systems (RIS)**: This expands upon the NIS by focusing on sub-national regions, highlighting how local conditions and interactions contribute to innovation outcomes. It analyzes the regional networks of actors and their collaboration, often emphasizing local clusters of industries that drive competitive advantages.

- **Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS)**: This classification focuses on specific sectors (like pharmaceuticals, ICT, etc.) and explores how innovation occurs within those particular sectors. It examines sectoral dynamics, technological paths, and inter-industry relationships.

- **Technological Innovation Systems (TIS)**: This framework analyzes the development and diffusion of specific technologies. It highlights the importance of learning and knowledge creation processes, including the support mechanisms that facilitate technological advancement.

Methodologies typically used in these frameworks include:
1. **Quantitative Methods**: These focus on collecting and analyzing data to measure innovation outputs, such as patents, R&D spending, and university-industry collaborations. Techniques include econometric analysis, surveys, and statistical modeling.
2. **Qualitative Methods**: Case studies and interviews often help to understand specific interactions between actors, elucidating the mechanisms of knowledge transfer and the role of institutions.
3. **Network Analysis**: This involves examining the relationships and collaborations among innovation actors, enabling the mapping of knowledge flows and identifying key players within the system.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing different innovation systems across countries or regions, researchers can identify best practices and effective policy measures to improve innovation performance.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The document in question discusses innovation systems analytically and methodologically, emphasizing the critical issues in defining and understanding these systems as well as their classifications. It addresses three important analytical challenges: determining the appropriate level of analysis, delineating the system to identify actors and components, and establishing performance metrics for the system. Innovations can occur at multiple interrelated levels (national, regional, sectoral, and technological), and the frameworks outlined allow for a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of innovation. The thorough examination of these frameworks and methodologies also aligns with the analytical focus of the document, which raises pertinent questions about how best to approach innovation research.
