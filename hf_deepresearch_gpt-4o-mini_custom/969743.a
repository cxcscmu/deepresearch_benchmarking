{'1. Task outcome (short version)': 'In 2021, global trade volumes and values experienced a significant recovery from the declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with trade values expected to reach approximately $28 trillion, marking an increase of 23% compared to 2020.', '2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version)': 'Global trade was profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which saw a significant downturn. However, 2021 witnessed a robust recovery in trade volumes and values. According to the UNCTAD Global Trade Report, global trade was expected to rise by 23%, resulting in an estimated total value of around $28 trillion in 2021. This recovery can be attributed to renewed demand and easing of restrictions as economies began to reopen. Reports indicate that there was a peak recovery in trade in the second quarter of 2021, although growth rates began to moderate toward the end of the year.\n\nMoreover, while the overall merchandise trade volumes were recovering, significant challenges persisted in certain sectors due to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The trade data also highlighted regional variations and indicative trends across different market segments as countries and industries adjusted to the post-pandemic landscape.', '3. Additional context': 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) data specifically regarding the global trade volumes and values was not directly accessible, which necessitated reliance on secondary sources such as UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization. Furthermore, while there were promisingforecasts for trade recovery, the ongoing impact of supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions could affect longer-term growth prospects. \n\nIn terms of terrorism, the Global Terrorism Database indicates that a decline in terrorism-related deaths and incidents worldwide since 2014 has not eliminated the threats to trade, particularly in conflict-afflicted regions. For instance, countries like Afghanistan and Nigeria, which experience high rates of terrorism, often see disruptions in trade routes that can affect their economic health, highlighting the persistent link between global security and trade stability.'}
