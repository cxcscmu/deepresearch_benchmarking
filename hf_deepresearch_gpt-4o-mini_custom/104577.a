### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change is primarily caused by the greenhouse effect, where gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, leading to global warming. This process is significantly accelerated by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2).
### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities. The greenhouse effect itself is a natural process where certain gases (like CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor) trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space and thus warming the planet. Without this effect, Earth would be significantly cooler, making it less hospitable for life.

NASA plays a crucial role in understanding climate change through extensive research and monitoring. Their initiatives include:
1. **Satellite Observations**: NASA's Earth observation satellites collect data on atmospheric gases, temperatures, sea levels, and changes in ice sheets and glaciers. This allows scientists to track the impacts of climate change in real-time.
2. **Climate Models**: NASA utilizes complex climate models to predict how increased greenhouse gas concentrations will affect global temperatures and weather patterns in the future.
3. **Research Initiatives**: Projects like Operation IceBridge survey changes in polar regions, providing critical data on the effects of climate change on Arctic ice and ecosystems.
4. **Interdisciplinary Studies**: NASA collaborates with other research institutions to enhance understanding of climate change's impacts on various Earth systems, such as ocean health, atmospheric conditions, and the biosphere.

A specific highlight is that scientists have noted a significant rise in Earth's average temperature by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, largely caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. NASA's data indicate that these changes will continue to influence global climates and weather patterns.
### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
NASA's commitment to climate science also emphasizes outreach and education through programs and resources aimed at informing the public and engaging future scientists. Their research is crucial not only for understanding the current state of the climate but also for shaping climate-related policies and responses.
