However, many sole traders experience challenges that can lead to failure within their first year of operation. This report aims to summarize the reasons for these failures, supported by recent statistics and insights from industry experts.

In 2023, specific statistics for sole trader failure rates are limited. However, broader statistics suggest that about 20% of small businesses fail in their first year, with prior observations indicating that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic still impact the economic landscape for sole traders. Approximately 34% of sole traders anticipated being worse off financially as compared to 22% of limited companies.

### 3. Common Reasons for Failure
Based on research and expert opinions, the common reasons for sole trader failures include:
