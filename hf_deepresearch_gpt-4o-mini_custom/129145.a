The reasons for the rise in crude oil prices in April 2023 are multifaceted. Firstly, OPEC+ production cuts have tightened supply while global demand is experiencing a recovery as economies rebound post-COVID. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have added volatility and risk premiums in the oil markets. As such, Brent and WTI oil prices have risen significantly, with averages for Brent at approximately $101.48 and WTI at approximately $96.20 in 2022. Future pricing will likely continue to be influenced by OPEC+ decisions and broader geopolitical developments affecting global oil supply.
