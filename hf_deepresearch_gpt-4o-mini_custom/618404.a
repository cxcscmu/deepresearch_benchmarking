### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of social media on teenagers includes both positive and negative effects, with significant research indicating correlations with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, alongside benefits such as social connectivity.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Research findings indicate that:
- A large majority of teens are active on social media platforms, creating a new dynamic in their social interactions and psychological well-being. 
- Studies, such as those by Linda Charmaraman and Common Sense Media, illustrate that extended social media usage can lead to distractions from academics and real-life interactions, with 57% of teens in one study acknowledging that social media interferes with their homework. 
- The positive aspects of social media include the ability to connect and communicate, potentially finding support networks for those struggling with issues such as mental health challenges.
- Conversely, multiple studies reveal a worrying correlation between social media use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem among adolescents, particularly due to social comparisons.
- Longitudinal studies indicate that while social media might not always serve as a direct cause of poor mental health, heavier usage is often linked to pre-existing mental health issues.
- An important systematic review found that time spent on social media, engagement levels, and addictive patterns were correlated with depression and anxiety.
- The changing nature of social media platforms complicates the research landscape, leading to recommendations for continual evaluation of their effects on mental health.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
It's essential for parents and educators to foster an environment of open dialogue about social media use, highlighting both the advantages and disadvantages while providing strategies to mitigate potential risks. Encouraging limited screen time and active discussions about online experiences can help balance the positive connectivity with potential mental health challenges.
