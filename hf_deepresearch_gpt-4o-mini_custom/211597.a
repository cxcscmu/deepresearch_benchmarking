Reverend Parris in Arthur Millerâ€™s 'The Crucible' is characterized by his abusive use of power. He prioritizes greed, paranoia, and self-preservation, which ultimately triggers the tragic events within Salem. His obsession with wealth, evident in his desire for golden candlesticks over spiritual leadership, along with his actions during the witch trials, exemplifies his manipulation of authority for personal gain, resulting in dire consequences for the community.
