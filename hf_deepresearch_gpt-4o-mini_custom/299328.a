### Structured Report on Texas Abortion Law

#### 1. Current Laws
Texas abortion laws are strictly regulated and include the following key provisions:
- **Timeframe for Abortion**: Abortions are legal up to 20-22 weeks of gestation, except when the mother's life is at risk or the fetus has severe abnormalities. New legislation may eliminate exceptions for non-viable fetuses.
- **Mandatory Visits and Waiting Period**: Women are required to make at least two visits for the abortion procedure; the first visit must be dedicated to an ultrasound. There is a mandatory 24-hour waiting period that can be waived if the woman lives more than 100 miles from the nearest clinic.
- **State-Mandated Information**: Patients must receive specific written materials and have their ultrasound images shown and described to them.
- **Medication-Induced Abortions**: Women seeking a medical abortion must attend four appointments with a licensed physician.
- **Parental Consent**: Minors must have parental consent to obtain an abortion, with judicial bypass options available in specific cases.

#### 2. Recent Legislative Changes
Recent developments include the "Heartbeat Act," which allows individuals to sue abortion providers who perform abortions past the six-week mark and places additional restrictions on abortion access. Proposed legislation may further restrict exceptions for cases of severe fetal anomalies.

#### 3. Legislative History
Over the decades, Texas has seen significant changes in abortion legislation. More than 18 anti-abortion measures have been enacted since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. Key historical changes include Mandating parental consent for minors, and requiring ultrasounds.

#### 4. Social Context
Public opinion in Texas is divided. Recent polling indicates that while there is substantial support for abortion rights nationally, a majority of Texas voters have shown support for the six-week abortion ban. Advocacy groups continue to contest these laws, showcasing the ongoing societal and political contention surrounding reproductive rights in Texas.

### Conclusion
Texas abortion laws present considerable challenges to accessing safe and legal abortions. The ongoing legal and social battles surrounding these regulations highlight the contentious nature of this issue in American society.
