### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The causes of violent crime are multifaceted, encompassing:
- **Social Factors**: These include environmental influences, such as income inequality and familial dynamics.
- **Psychological Factors**: Mental health issues, personality disorders, and individual dysfunction are deemed significant contributors to violent behavior.
- **Theoretical Perspectives**: Various approaches such as social learning theory and aggression models offer differing viewpoints on why individuals engage in violence.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The examination of violent crime reveals a complex interplay of social and psychological factors:

- **Theoretical Frameworks**: Richard Felson's work highlights how violent crime is both a behavior of violence and rule-breaking, necessitating a dual theoretical approach encompassing aggression and deviance. His assertion is that behaviors leading to harm (violence) and rule-breaking (crime) stem from rational choices and different motivational factors.

- **Income Inequality**: Mario Coccia's research indicates that income inequality is a significant predictor of homicide rates, suggesting that socio-economic disparities play a crucial role in violent crime.

- **Psychological Explanations**: Research published in journals such as the *Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment* elucidates that chronic violent behavior often correlates with internal pathologies, including familial dysfunction and individual psychological disturbances. It argues that pathways to violence can often be traced back to an individual's mental health and familial upbringing.

- **Personality Factors**: The big five personality traits and their relation to criminal behavior have been explored in the literature, with implications that traits such as high impulsiveness and low agreeableness may correlate with violent tendencies.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
- The environment in which individuals reside, including socio-economic conditions and community structures, can further exacerbate tendencies towards violent crime. Factors such as group dynamics, peer influence, and social support systems play a role in either mitigating or exacerbating violent behaviors.
- Additional reading from the articles explores the relation of these theories to specific violent acts, improving understanding of domestic violence and gang-related crimes, illustrating that different types of violent crime may be influenced by different factors.

Overall, studying these various factors contributes to a comprehensive understanding of violent crime, potentially guiding policies and intervention strategies aimed at reducing its occurrence.
