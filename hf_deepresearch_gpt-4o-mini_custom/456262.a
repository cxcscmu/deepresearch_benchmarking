### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Gun owners are at a statistically higher risk of being shot than non-gun owners, particularly in domestic situations, where increased gun ownership correlates with higher rates of homicide and suicide.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Multiple studies indicate a clear relationship between gun ownership and increased risk of being shot. Research from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center points out that areas with higher gun ownership experience more gun-related deaths, including suicides and domestic homicides. For instance, a study revealed that each 10% increase in gun ownership elevates the risk of a household member being killed by 13%. This alarming statistic emphasizes that owning a gun can actually escalate the potential for fatal incidents within the home.

Further research has shown that individuals who carry guns are also at a higher risk of being shot compared to those who donâ€™t. A study analyzing shooting victims in Philadelphia found that those carrying guns were more likely to be involved in gun violence, highlighting that the act of carrying can bring about dangerous situations that could lead to serious harm or death.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The ongoing debate surrounding gun ownership often includes claims that firearms provide protection, but empirical evidence supports the opposite. Many gun rights advocates argue that having a gun deters violent crime; however, substantial data suggests that higher rates of gun ownership correlate with increased rates of homicide and unintentional shootings. The complexity of gun ownership's effects on society reflects significant social and psychological factors. Ultimately, while some individuals justify carrying firearms for self-defense, numerous studies illustrate that the actual likelihood of being shot increases with gun ownership, particularly in domestic environments.
