### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Media influence has been shown to significantly affect public perception, with a notable decline in trust in news media and rising concerns over fake news and misinformation, particularly through social media platforms.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The research into media influence reveals several concerning statistics regarding the trustworthiness of media, especially in the context of fake news:
- **Declining Trust in Media**: A global study indicates that media trust decreased by 8% from 2020 to 2021, dropping from 61% to 53% of the population citing trust in mainstream media.
- **Encountering Fake News**: 52% of Americans report regularly encountering fake news online, and 67% of adults have seen false information circulating on social media.
- **Social Media as a Distrusted Source**: Social media platforms are particularly vulnerable, as they remain the least trusted news source, with users struggling to differentiate between fake news and legitimate information.
- **Engagement with Fake News**: In Q3 of 2020, there were around 1.8 billion instances of engagement with fake news on platforms like Facebook, indicating a widespread problem.
- **Impact on Political Perception**: Specifically, 35.5% of millennials turn to platforms like Facebook for political news, which can propagate misinformation and shape their opinions based on unreliable sources.
These trends reflect a complex relationship between media influence, perceived responsibility, and the trustworthiness of information disseminated in contemporary society.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The increase of misinformation in society raises questions about the responsibility of media outlets to ensure accurate reporting, as well as the onus on consumers to critically evaluate the information they encounter. With the growing influence of social media, the landscape of news consumption and the psychological impacts of media narratives are more crucial than ever in shaping public opinion.
