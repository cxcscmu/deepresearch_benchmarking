### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists on October 6, 1981, due to his peace treaty with Israel, which provoked significant dissent among various factions in Egypt.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Anwar Sadat served as Egypt's president from 1970 until his assassination on October 6, 1981. He is known for transitioning Egypt from Soviet to American alignment and for being the first Arab leader to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, which was a pivotal moment in Middle Eastern politics but also fueled opposition against him from hardline Islamic groups and nationalists.

On the day of his assassination, Sadat was attending a military parade commemorating the 1973 Yom Kippur War when he was shot and killed by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Their motivations stemmed from Sadat's peace efforts with Israel, his departure from traditional Arab nationalism, and his alignment with Western policies, which they opposed vehemently. The assassination was not merely a personal act of revenge but also part of a broader ideology against secularism and perceived betrayals of Arab identity.

After his assassination, Sadat's death had significant implications on Egypt's political landscape, leading to a clampdown on Islamic groups, and it set the stage for the eventual rise of Islamist movements in the region.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Sadat's assassination ignited a period of turmoil and transition in Egypt, influencing both domestic politics and international relations. His successor, Hosni Mubarak, implemented strict measures against Islamist groups, which continued to shape the socio-political context of Egypt in the ensuing decades.
