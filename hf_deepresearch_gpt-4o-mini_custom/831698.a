### Relationship between External Validity and the College Sophomore Problem

#### Definition of External Validity:
External validity refers to the degree to which findings from a research study can be generalized to other populations, settings, and times. It allows researchers to apply their results beyond the specific circumstances of their study, aiming for broader applicability in real-world contexts.

#### Definition of the College Sophomore Problem:
The college sophomore problem in research describes the bias that occurs when studies predominantly rely on college sophomores as participants. This practice often leads to findings that lack generalizability, as this demographic does not represent the broader population's behaviors or attitudes.

#### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between external validity and the college sophomore problem is rooted in the generalizability of research findings. When studies primarily employ college sophomores as research participants, the external validity of the outcomes is compromised. The specific behaviors and traits observed in this narrow demographic may not reflect the diverse characteristics present in the general population. To improve external validity, researchers are encouraged to include more varied age groups and backgrounds in their studies, ensuring that findings can be more widely applicable.
