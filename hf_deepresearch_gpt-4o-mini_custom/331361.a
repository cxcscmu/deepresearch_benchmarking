### 1. Task outcome (short version):
World War I significantly impacted civilians through economic hardships, social changes, psychological effects, and high casualty rates. Estimated civilian casualties were around 10 to 15 million, with profound economic consequences including widespread shortages and the entry of women into the workforce.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
World War I affected civilians on an unprecedented scale:
- **Economic effects**: The war led to severe shortages of essential goods, resulting in rationing of food supplies, such as bread, tea, sugar, and meat. It also cost nations heavily, with the Allies spending an estimated $147 billion compared to the Central Powers' $61 billion. The UK, for example, incurred a notable decline in real GDP throughout the 1920s due to wartime economic strains, well over 25% of its domestic and 24% of its overseas assets were lost.

- **Social effects**: With a majority of men drafted into the military, women filled roles in factories and other industries, marking a significant shift in gender roles and expectations. Social structures changed dramatically due to the loss of male workers, leading to a transformation in family dynamics.

- **Psychological effects**: The war's psychological impact was deeply felt both during and after the conflict. Many returning soldiers dealt with severe trauma known then as shell shock, which affected their families and communities. Civilians were also psychologically impacted by the experiences of loss, hardship, and the pervasive presence of war.

- **Casualty statistics**: The total casualties (including both military and civilian) of World War I were around 40 million. Estimates suggest that 9-11 million civilians directly perished due to the war causes, along with millions suffering from malnutrition and health impacts incited by the war's demands.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The legacy of World War I on civilians extends far beyond the immediate effects of the war itself. It set the stage for future social norms, economic policies, and psychological treatments for veterans and civilians alike, shaping national identities and facilitating transformations in societal roles that continue to resonate today.
