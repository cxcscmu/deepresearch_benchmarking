### 1. Overview of Reaganomics
Reaganomics refers to the economic policies instituted by President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s, characterized by supply-side economics. The policies aimed to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts, deregulation, and reduced government spending.

### 2. Key Principles
- **Reduced Government Spending:** Aimed at reducing the federal deficit but resulted in redirects rather than true cuts.
- **Tax Cuts:** Focused on lowering income and corporate taxes to spur investment and growth.
- **Deregulation:** Efforts to reduce government oversight of businesses, promoting a free-market economy.
- **Controlling the Money Supply:** Aimed at curbing inflation by controlling monetary growth.

### 3. Major Failures and Critiques
Despite these intentions, the execution and outcomes of Reaganomics have faced significant criticism:
- **Increased Income Inequality:** Economic growth primarily benefited the wealthy, deepening the gap between rich and poor.
- **Rising Poverty Rates:** Fluctuations in poverty levels, peaking during Reagan's tenure, were linked to cuts in social programs.
- **Reduced Social Welfare:** Cuts in federal aid targeted at vulnerable populations, exacerbating poverty conditions.
- **Long-Term National Debt Increase:** National debt tripled from $997 billion in 1981 to approximately $2.857 trillion by 1989, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability.

### 4. Conclusion
While Reaganomics is credited with fostering an immediate economic recovery during its implementation, the long-term effects included heightened income inequality and increased poverty levels, leading many critics to label it a failure overall. The policies cut deeply into social support systems and shifted the economic landscape in ways that continue to influence discussions on economic equality today.
