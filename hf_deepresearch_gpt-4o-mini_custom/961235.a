### Short Version:
Victims return to abusive relationships due to economic dependence, fear of increased violence, emotional manipulation, secondary victimization, parental obligations, psychological dependency, and societal myths.

### Detailed Explanation:
- Economic Dependence: Many victims are financially dependent on their abusers, making it challenging to leave.
- Fear of Increased Violence: Leaving may escalate risks of severe violence or even death.
- Emotional Manipulation: Victims often feel responsible for the abuse and believe they can prevent it by changing their behavior.
- Secondary Victimization: Victims may face blame and stigma from society, which can reinforce their trauma and lead them back to the abuser.
- Parental Obligations: The desire to keep the family unit intact can complicate decisions to leave.
- Psychological Dependency: Emotional ties, such as trauma bonding, can create complex feelings that hinder separation.
- Societal Myths: Misconceptions about abuse may lead victims to feel isolated or unsupported when they try to leave.

### Statistics and Theoretical Insights:
Statistics indicate that nearly 1 in 3 women experience physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner, which highlights the severity of the issue. Research suggests that the likelihood of returning to an abuser is influenced by societal attitudes and individual perceptions, which reflect the broader context of domestic violence.
