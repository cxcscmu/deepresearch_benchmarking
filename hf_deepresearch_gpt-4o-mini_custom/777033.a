### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The societal norms of the late 19th and early 20th centuries influenced photographic practices, leading to a general avoidance of smiles in portraits due to cultural expectations of seriousness and practical limitations of early photographic technology.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, photography evolved rapidly with the introduction of accessible cameras like the Kodak Brownie, democratizing its use among the upper and middle classes. However, the societal norms surrounding portrait photography were rooted in previous artistic conventions that dictated a serious demeanor. Early photographs often resembled painted portraits where subjects were expected to appear dignified, emphasizing the purpose of capturing oneâ€™s likeness rather than spontaneous moments.

Another key factor was the technology of the time; early cameras had long exposure times, often requiring subjects to stay still for extended periods. This made it impractical to hold a smile, leading photographers to instruct subjects to maintain a serious expression. As such, even joyful occasions like weddings were documented with sober faces, reinforcing a culture of seriousness in portraiture.
Additionally, the cultural context of the Victorian era, which valued decorum and restraint, further discouraged smiling in portraits. Smiles were often viewed as inappropriate or frivolous, contributing to the prevailing aesthetic that photographs should reflect solemnity rather than happiness.

One exception noted was a photograph of a boy looking off-camera with a slight smile, indicating that while rare, smiles were not entirely absent from early photography. However, these moments were exceptions rather than the norm, and the predominant appearance in portraits was one of seriousness.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The transition away from these norms began in the 20th century, with changing societal values that embraced more candid and expressive forms of photography, reflecting a shift toward informal and joyful representations in portraiture.
