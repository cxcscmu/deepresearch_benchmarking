### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of social media on sleep has been widely studied, revealing correlations between social media usage and sleep disturbances, particularly among young adults and adolescents. Peer-reviewed studies indicate that increased social media use is associated with poorer sleep quality and increased difficulty in falling asleep.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Numerous studies have explored the relationship between social media usage and sleep disturbances:
- **University of Pittsburgh Study (2016)**: This study found that young adults who frequently engage with social media are more likely to experience sleep disturbances than their peers who use it less. The results indicated a need for physicians to inquire about social media habits during sleep assessments.

- **BMJ Open Study (2019)**: Analyzed data from approximately 11,872 adolescents aged 13-15. The research highlighted significant associations between social media usage patterns and sleep parameters. The results suggested that adolescents with higher social media engagement reported poorer sleep quality, struggling more to fall asleep than their less engaged counterparts.

- **Preventive Medicine Journal (2016)**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis showing that higher volume and frequency of social media use correlate with elevated sleep disturbance rates among young adults, controlling for various sociodemographic factors.

Overall, the literature suggests that extensive social media use could lead to anxiety, increase cognitive arousal, and disrupt circadian rhythms, contributing to sleep disruptions.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
While many studies observe correlations rather than causation, they underline a growing concern that habitual social media engagement, especially before bedtime, may hinder sleep quality and duration. Recommendations for improving sleep health could include reducing social media use in the hours leading up to sleep and creating a more conducive sleep environment.
