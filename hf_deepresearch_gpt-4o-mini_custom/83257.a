### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The federal policies funding first responders after 9/11 include the reauthorization of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, the First Responder Initiative, and the establishment of the WTC Health Program, which provide financial aid, health care, and support services to first responders and victims.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, several federal policies were enacted to support first responders and victims:

- **9/11 Victim Compensation Fund (VCF):** Reauthorized in July 2019 for an additional 73 years, allowing victims and their families to file claims through 2090 with payouts extending to 2092. This fund specifically aims to provide financial support for medical care and other expenses incurred by first responders and survivors due to the attacks. The Senate approved this legislation with a significant majority (97 to 2), emphasizing its importance in supporting the community affected by 9/11.

- **First Responder Initiative:** This program proposed a budget of approximately $3.5 billion in 2003 to enhance the homeland security response capabilities of first responders across the United States. This initiative aimed to improve not just funding but also the training and resources available to first responders in crisis situations.

- **WTC Health Program:** Administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), this federal health program offers no-cost medical monitoring and treatment for individuals suffering from health conditions caused by exposure to the 9/11 attacks. The program also funds crucial research on the long-term health impacts of these exposures, ensuring continuous support for affected first responders.

- **Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act:** Enacted shortly after the attacks, this act ensured that the payments received from the VCF were exempt from federal taxes and introduced additional lesser-known tax breaks for injured and ill responders, making it easier for them and their families to manage the financial burden resulting from the tragedies.

Overall, these policies demonstrate a concentrated effort by the federal government to ensure the welfare of first responders and victims who endured health challenges and financial difficulties as a direct outcome of the September 11 attacks.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
In addition to federal funding and policies, various nonprofit organizations and community resources have emerged to support 9/11 victims and their families over the years. Scholarships, services, and assistance programs continue to be available, signifying an ongoing commitment to helping those affected by the 9/11 attacks.
