### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The IPCC report, released on August 9, 2021, confirms that nearly 100% of global warming is due to human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes the urgent need for immediate action to limit climate change.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the first part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) titled "Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis" on August 9, 2021. This report represents a significant advancement in climate science, consolidating over 234 authors' work from 66 countries. The report asserts that:
- Human activities have caused approximately 1.1째C of warming since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900), and it is nearly certain that human influence is responsible for the majority of this increase.
- Projections indicate that over the next 20 years, global temperatures are likely to reach or exceed the 1.5째C threshold established in the Paris Agreement if current trends continue.
- Extreme weather events, such as increased heatwaves, floods, and droughts, have become more frequent and intense, directly linked to human-induced climate change.
- The report emphasizes the need for immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to limit further warming to about 1.5째C or even 2째C.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The IPCC report underscores the urgency of addressing climate change through collective international efforts. It stresses that the longer action is delayed, the more challenging and costly mitigation will become, significantly narrowing the options for effective climate response. Global populations, governments, and industries must engage in significant emission reductions and adapt to the changes already set in motion by earlier emissions. The findings call for immediate policy changes and economic strategies that prioritize sustainability and long-term environmental health.
