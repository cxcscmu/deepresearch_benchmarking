### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The abolition of slavery saw crucial legislative changes and key events across various nations, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, marked by significant laws like the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in 1865, and global conventions like the 1926 Slavery Convention.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The history of slavery abolition is characterized by several pivotal events and legislative actions that collectively contributed to ending the practice of slavery worldwide:

- **British Abolition of Slave Trade (1807)**: The Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the transatlantic slave trade in the British Empire, serving as a significant early step toward abolition.

- **Slavery Abolition Act (1833)**: This crucial legislation led to the complete abolition of slavery throughout the British colonies on August 1, 1834, representing a significant victory for abolitionists in Britain.

- **American Civil War and the 13th Amendment (1865)**: Passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified later that year, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United States. However, it included an 'exception clause' that allowed for forced labor as punishment for crimes.

- **Global Movements**: The abolitionist movement gained traction throughout the 19th century, with the World Anti-Slavery Convention held in 1840 advocating for abolition and women's rights. This convention marked a notable intersection of social justice causes.

- **Other Global Milestones**: Countries like Brazil abolished slavery in 1888 through the 'Lei Aurea' (Golden Law). Saudi Arabia officially abolished slavery in 1962, representing one of the last countries to do so.

- **1926 Slavery Convention**: Established under the League of Nations, this international treaty aimed to suppress the slave trade and defined slavery internationally. It was later supplemented by the 1956 amendment which addressed modern forms of slavery and human trafficking.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The global abolition of slavery is not just a series of legislative actions but also a result of relentless activism by individuals and groups who advocated for human rights and dignity. Figures like William Wilberforce in Britain, Frederick Douglass in the U.S., and Victor Sch≈ìlcher in France played vital roles in educating the public and influencing policymakers. The historical context of these events illustrates the broader fight for the rights of oppressed peoples, which continues in various forms today.
