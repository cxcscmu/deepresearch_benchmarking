### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Natural disasters are severe weather events characterized by their potential to cause significant damage, injury, and loss of life.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), natural disasters comprise extreme events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. These events typically result in extensive physical destruction, societal disruption, and possible fatalities. NOAA emphasizes preparedness and response strategies to mitigate the impacts of such disasters. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), while not providing a single definition, addresses how climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of these natural occurrences, suggesting that many disasters are linked to environmental changes caused by human activity. A commonly accepted definition from sources like Merriam-Webster describes natural disasters as sudden and catastrophic natural events that lead to significant destruction and casualty.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The NOAA serves a crucial role in researching, monitoring, and disseminating information related to climate phenomena and disasters, aiming to enhance public understanding and preparedness. The IPCC provides broader context and scientific analysis regarding how climatic conditions are increasingly affecting the nature and frequency of natural disasters globally.
