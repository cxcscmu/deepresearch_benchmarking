# Report: The Transformation of the Civil War's Objectives

## Introduction
The Civil War, which occurred from 1861 to 1865, was fundamentally a conflict over the future of the United States. Initially framed as a war to preserve the Union, it gradually evolved into a moral crusade to end slavery.

## Causes of the Civil War
The causes of the Civil War are often oversimplified to a moral conflict over slavery. However, economic factors, particularly tariffs, and the political imperative to maintain the Union were equally significant. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 intensified sectional tensions, as it benefitted the North at the expense of the South.

## Key Events
- **Lincoln’s Election** (1860): Triggered the secession of Southern states.
- **Secession of South Carolina** (1860): Marked the beginning of the Confederacy.
- **Emancipation Proclamation** (January 1, 1863): Issued by Lincoln, this pivotal declaration transformed the war’s focus, framing it as a conflict against slavery.

## Perspectives of Key Figures
### Abraham Lincoln
Lincoln's views on slavery evolved as the war progressed:
- Initially focused on preserving the Union, he later embraced emancipation.
- He stated, "Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves," reflecting his growing moral clarity.

### Frederick Douglass
Douglass viewed the Civil War as an essential struggle for freedom:
- He urged for the enlistment of African American soldiers and advocated for a war that aimed to eradicate slavery completely.

## Conclusion
The intertwining goals of preserving the Union and ending slavery became increasingly prominent as the war unfolded, with key figures like Lincoln and Douglass playing significant roles in shaping the narrative. The Civil War ultimately transformed into a fight for freedom, marking a significant turning point in American history.
