### Report on the Reasons Behind Cuban Protests

#### Historical Context
Protests in Cuba have a long history tied to political repression and socio-economic challenges. Key events include:

- **Post-Revolution Era (1959-1990)**: The Cuban Revolution led to significant government suppression of dissent, particularly against Fidel Castro's regime. Protests during and after the revolution were met with severe retaliation, creating a culture of fear.
- **Economic Crises**: Economic difficulties persisted, particularly during the late 1980s with the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to public dissatisfaction.

#### Current Socio-Economic Conditions (2023)
As of 2023, Cuba is facing an economic crisis characterized by:
- **High Inflation**: Inflation remains high at around 30%, exacerbating living conditions for citizens.
- **Shortages**: There are critical shortages of food and medicine, leading to long queues for basic necessities.
- **Public Discontent**: Cubans have expressed frustration through protests, ignited by deteriorating living standards and unmet economic reform promises.
  
#### Political Climate and Government Response
- The Cuban government has responded to recent protests with a crackdown, utilizing police force to disperse gatherings and detain activists.
- Citizens have vocalized frustrations by chanting for "freedom" and sharing calls for humanitarian intervention, such as the #SOSCuba campaign.

#### Conclusion
Cubans are protesting primarily due to prolonged economic hardship, insufficient government response to crises, and demands for freedoms that the current regime has historically suppressed. This unrest reflects deeper grievances about political repression and socio-economic challenges in an environment where public dissent is rarely tolerated.
