#### Current Ethical Guidelines:
**American Psychological Association (APA)**:
- Beneficence and Nonmaleficence: Do no harm while maximizing benefits.
- Fidelity and Responsibility: Establish trust and uphold professional responsibilities.
- Integrity: Ensure transparency and honesty.
- Justice: Promote fairness and equality in participant treatment.
- Respect for Peopleâ€™s Rights: Safeguard autonomy and confidentiality.

**National Institutes of Health (NIH)**:
- Focus on informed consent and ethical treatment of human subjects.
- Guidelines on responsible research conduct and compliance with regulations to protect participants.

#### Arguments:
- Historical cases demonstrate that ethical violations can occur in the absence of strict oversight and adherence to ethical standards.
- Ethical principles established by organizations like APA and NIH are essential for preventing misconduct and promoting responsible research.
