### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Common socio-economic factors driving people to migrate to megacities include economic opportunity, better education, improved healthcare, and quality of life.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Migration to megacities is significantly influenced by a combination of socio-economic factors, which can be categorized as follows:

- **Economic Opportunities**: The primary driver for migration to megacities is the promise of better job prospects. Individuals facing unemployment or low wage jobs in rural areas are often attracted to urban centers where they can find better-paying employment. Economic factors such as poverty, lack of financial resources, and the pursuit of advancement lead to the migration of skilled and unskilled labor alike.

- **Educational Aspirations**: Many migrants seek access to better educational facilities available in megacities. Rural areas often lack sufficient educational institutions, compelling families to move in search of improved educational prospects for their children. This educational migration is not just limited to primary and secondary education but extends to higher education institutions as well.

- **Healthcare Access**: Access to quality healthcare services is often significantly better in megacities compared to rural areas. Migrants often seek better healthcare services to improve their and their families' health conditions, making healthcare access a key factor driving migration.

- **Quality of Life**: Non-economic factors, such as improved access to services and amenities (e.g., public transportation, cultural activities, and recreational facilities), also play a crucial role in migration decisions. People often perceive megacities as offering a higher standard of living, which includes social services, entertainment, and overall greater opportunities for a balanced life.

- **Social Networks**: Established communities and familial ties within megacities encourage further migration. Social networks provide support to new migrants, making it easier for them to adapt to urban life, find jobs, and access social services.

- **Natural Increase**: In addition to migration, natural population growth also contributes to the expansion of megacities. Urban areas frequently experience higher birth rates, which, combined with migration, leads to rapid population growth.

- **Political and Environmental Factors**: Migration can also be driven by political instability, environmental disasters, or climate change impacts that displace populations from rural areas.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The phenomenon of migration to megacities is not merely a local issue; it reflects broader global trends driven by economic globalization, urbanization, and demographic changes. Policymakers must consider these socio-economic factors when addressing the challenges associated with urban growth, including infrastructure strain, housing shortages, and environmental sustainability.
