### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change substantially affects developed countries, leading to severe economic losses, environmental degradation, and significant social impacts, as outlined by various statistics and recent evidence.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Economic Impacts:**
Climate change is projected to shrink global economic output by up to $23 trillion annually by 2050 if significant measures are not taken to reduce emissions. Countries like the US and those in Europe are experiencing rising costs from climate-related disasters, impacting economic stability and increasing spending on disaster response and infrastructure adaptations. 
For instance, a Deloitte survey noted that over 50% of respondents across 23 countries had experienced climate-related extreme weather events in the last six months, affecting economic and personal wellbeing. Another estimate suggests economic damages may reach approximately $1.7 trillion annually by 2025, escalating to about $30 trillion by 2075 if no preventive measures are enacted.

**Environmental Impacts:**
Developed nations face increased greenhouse gas emissions and deteriorating air quality. The UK's Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ranked it high overall, but ongoing challenges remain due to high carbon emissions from transport and industry. Biodiversity loss and pollution related to climate change exacerbate environmental stresses caused by industrial activities. In Denmark, for example, an EPI score of 95 reflects effective climate action, yet disparities exist within Europe regarding climate resilience.

**Social Impacts:**
The social consequences of climate change represent significant challenges, categorized as one of the biggest social injustices of our time. Public health risks are heightened due to increased extreme weather events, leading to significant health disparities among populations. The Lancet Countdown tracks public health indicators related to climate change, highlighting vulnerabilities induced by climate-related impacts. The urgent need for adaptation and resilience measures is critical, as the demographic most affected often includes marginalized communities disproportionately vulnerable to climate effects. This results in worsening inequalities, as access to resources becomes limited due to environmental changes.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Urgent actions need to be taken to mitigate these effects, ranging from policy changes to grassroots activism focused on promoting sustainability and equity in climate action. The interrelation of climate change with economic, environmental, and social spheres necessitates comprehensive strategies that ensure resilience and support for affected communities.
