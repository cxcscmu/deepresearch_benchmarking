### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Shareholder actions when firms have high cash reserves often include pressing for dividends, share buybacks, or strategic investments. High cash reserves can lead to increased expectations for returns, which may cause shareholder activism if the management underutilizes that cash.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
High cash reserves instigate a variety of shareholder actions shaped by the expectations and perceptions of investors. When companies retain substantial cash reserves, shareholders generally expect returns that may manifest as dividends or stock buybacks, increasing pressure on management. Key implications include:

1. **Expectations for Returns**: Investors anticipate that high cash levels will be used to benefit them, typically through increased dividends or stock buybacks. Failure to meet these expectations can lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and calls for management to deploy cash better.

2. **Pressure for Transparency and Performance**: Excessive cash holdings may raise concerns regarding managementâ€™s efficiency in capital allocation. Shareholders expect clarity on cash management, prompting management to account for cash levels or change strategies.

3. **Activism and Governance**: Activist investors may seize on high cash reserves to advocate for changes in management practices or strategic direction. They might propose actions that focus on returning cash to shareholders, potentially increasing influence over management decisions.

4. **Market Signals**: Companies with large, unallocated cash balances can signal operational inefficiencies and indeterminate growth strategies to the market, potentially impacting stock prices negatively.

5. **Financial Flexibility**: While cash reserves provide stability and flexibility allowing firms to seize timely investment opportunities, shareholders may hold diverging views regarding retaining cash for future investments versus distributing it. This creates tension between immediate shareholder returns and long-term strategy.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Value Creation**: Shareholders exhibit varied views on cash management strategies, where some prioritize immediate cash returns while others focus on long-term growth potential.

Overall, factors influencing shareholder behaviors are dynamic and can change based on market conditions, corporate performance, and management decisions.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The collected studies and references suggest a growing trend of shareholder activism correlated with high cash reserves, emphasizing that shareholders exert pressure on management for accountability regarding cash utilization. Additionally, corporate governance issues frequently arise as shareholders demand more favorable cash management strategies. Companies showcasing effective cash utilization effectively can often mitigate hostile shareholder actions.
