### 1. Task outcome (short version):
High college tuition costs significantly impact the U.S. economy by increasing student debt levels, which in turn inhibits consumer spending, affects homeownership rates, and delays key life decisions for graduates.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
High college tuition costs in the U.S. for the 2021-2022 academic year included an average of $7,941 for in-state public colleges and $21,536 for out-of-state colleges, with a total cost of attendance (including living expenses) averaging around $37,720. Since 1980, these costs have increased by 1,200%, far surpassing the 236% increase in the Consumer Price Index. This escalating debt has led to approximately $1.73 trillion in student loans, affecting nearly 45 million Americans, with over 10% defaulting on their loans.  The economic implications of such debt are profound, as it hampers graduates' ability to participate fully in the economy, delaying significant life decisions such as buying homes, starting families, and accumulating wealth. Studies have shown that young graduates are prioritizing debt repayment over significant investments, with high student debt making them less likely to purchase homes, which adversely impacts the housing market and overall economic growth. Moreover, graduates with large debts experience reduced consumption in other sectors, further slowing economic activity. Overall, the burden of high college tuition costs creates a ripple effect that significantly constrains economic growth and the financial wellbeing of millions of Americans.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The rising costs of college tuition raise important questions about the sustainability of higher education financing and the accessibility of college for future generations. Policymakers are being urged to explore comprehensive reforms on student loan systems and educational funding to prevent further economic disparities.
