### Final Report: Should High Schools Dispense Contraceptives to Students?

#### 1. Current Policies
Policies regarding contraceptive dispensing in high schools vary widely across the U.S. Some states, like California and Vermont, support and even mandate the distribution of contraceptives as part of comprehensive sexual health education. Others remain more conservative, reflecting community values and concerns about parental rights.

#### 2. Statistics on Teen Sexual Activity
- Approximately 55% of U.S. teens have engaged in sexual intercourse by age 18.
- Of those, around 80% reported using some form of contraception during their first sexual experience.
- The United States has seen a significant decline in teen pregnancy rates, attributed to increased contraceptive use.

#### 3. Health Benefits of Dispensing Contraceptives
- **Reduction in Teen Pregnancy Rates:** Access to contraceptives, especially condoms, can aid in decreasing unintended teenage pregnancies.
- **Decreased STIs:** Studies indicate that condom distribution programs effectively reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) without increasing sexual activity among teens.
- **Support for Sexual Health Education:** Availability of contraceptives can enhance educational programs, providing students with resources and knowledge to make informed choices about their sexual health.
- **Prevention of School Dropouts:** By preventing unintended pregnancies, schools can help more teens complete their education.

#### 4. Risks and Ethical Concerns
- **Effectiveness of Programs:** Some studies suggest that merely providing access to contraceptives isn’t sufficient for significantly lowering birth rates.
- **Parental and Ethical Concerns:** Many argue that schools should not dispense contraceptives without parental consent and that schools should endorse abstinence.
- **Cultural Perspectives:** There are concerns that making contraceptives available may alter teens' perceptions about sexual activity, potentially leading to increased sexual behavior that some families may not endorse.

#### 5. Conclusion
The debate over whether high schools should dispense contraceptives is complex and multifaceted. Proponents argue that it’s essential for students' health and educational outcomes, while opponents raise valid ethical and behavioral concerns. A balanced approach that involves community dialogue and the integration of effective sexual education is crucial for resolving this sensitive issue.

Public opinion is largely in favor of contraceptive access in schools, revealing a growing acceptance of the need to support teen sexual health while promoting responsible behavior.
