### Why is Air Pollution a Global Issue?

#### 1. Health Impacts
- Nearly 9 out of 10 people globally breathe polluted air, leading to approximately 7 million deaths annually due to both outdoor and indoor air pollution.
- Health conditions attributed to air pollution include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries.
- In 2019, it was reported that 99% of the world's population lived in areas where air quality standards set by WHO were not met.

#### 2. Economic Costs
- The economic burdens of air pollution encompass healthcare costs related to treating pollution-induced health conditions, lost productivity due to health-related absences, and environmental damage remediations.
- Recent estimates suggest that air pollution costs the U.S. economy as much as 5% of its GDP or approximately $790 billion in damages, primarily from premature deaths related to fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
- The annual regulatory costs to comply with air quality regulations can reach up to $30 billion.

#### 3. Conclusion
Air pollution poses a significant global challenge, affecting health, economies, and environments worldwide. Effective regulations and efforts are necessary to mitigate these detrimental effects and ensure cleaner air for future generations.
