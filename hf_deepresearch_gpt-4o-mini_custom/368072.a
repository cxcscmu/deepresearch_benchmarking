### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Efforts to end world hunger could cost between $30 billion and $330 billion annually, with proposals from various organizations suggesting different funding strategies and approaches.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):

Various estimates on the cost to end world hunger indicate a wide range of funding needs:
- According to the WFP, achieving zero hunger by 2030 would require around $267 billion annually, or approximately $160 per person living in extreme poverty. This is said to represent just 0.3% of the world's total economic output.
- The estimates for the cost to end world hunger fluctuate, with some reports suggesting it could be as low as $30 billion per year. This figure emphasizes the affordability when compared to larger budgets, like the U.S. defense budget, which was noted to be $737 billion in 2012.
- Global estimates vary considerably; a report highlighted that ending world hunger by 2030 might cost as much as $330 billion when considering the need for effective targeting of aid and innovative solutions.
- A report concludes that achieving this goal will not only require financial investment but also a comprehensive approach addressing the root causes of hunger such as conflict, climate change, and economic instability.

These findings reflect the complexities involved in accumulating the necessary financial support and the critical need for a multifaceted approach towards solving global hunger.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The fight against world hunger is part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly goal number 2 which aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Collaboration among countries and organizations will be essential in mobilizing the necessary funds and implementing effective strategies.
