### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Age of Exploration was primarily motivated by economic gain, the spread of Christianity, national pride, and technological advancements, encapsulated by the phrases "Gold, God, and Glory."

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Age of Exploration, spanning from the 15th to the early 17th centuries, was driven by four main motivations: economic, religious, political, and technological factors.

**Economic Motivations:**
1. **Search for New Trade Routes:** European nations sought to find new maritime routes to access the rich spices and goods of Asia (particularly India and the Spice Islands).
2. **Wealth from Resources:** Many explorers aimed to acquire gold and silver, as well as valuable resources such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton from newly discovered lands.
3. **Mercantilism:** The era was characterized by mercantilism; acquiring colonies was deemed essential for increasing a nation's wealth and power by controlling trade and resources.

**Religious Motivations:**
1. **Spread of Christianity:** A significant motivator was the desire to convert indigenous populations to Christianity. This was often framed as a religious duty, supported by the Pope and various European monarchs.
2. **Crusading Spirit:** The legacy of the Crusades instilled a sense of duty in many Europeans to spread their faith, leading to missions as part of exploration efforts.

**Political Motivations:**
1. **National Rivalry:** European powers were fiercely competitive, aiming to expand their empires and assert dominance over rivals.
2. **Colonization:** Nations sought to establish colonies for their survival and prosperity; new territories could provide economic benefits and strategic military advantages.
3. **Empire Building:** National pride and the glory of exploration were a matter of prestige, influencing nations to invest resources in explorations.

**Technological Factors:**
1. **Advancements in Shipbuilding:** Innovations such as the Caravel—a faster and more maneuverable ship—allowed explorers to travel longer distances.
2. **Navigation Tools:** The development of tools like the quadrant and later the astrolabe enabled sailors to measure their latitude and, later, longitude, which improved navigational accuracy.
3. **Cartography:** Improved maps and the understanding of world geography were crucial for exploration; the era saw significant advancements in the art of map-making.

In summary, the Age of Exploration was a complex interplay of economic ambitions, religious zeal, political competition, and technological advancements that redefined the world engagingly and destructively.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Age of Exploration permanently altered the world, leading to the establishment of trade routes that are still relevant today, the spread of cultures, and unfortunately, the colonization and exploitation of indigenous populations.
