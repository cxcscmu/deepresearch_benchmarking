### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Late-life divorce presents distinct adjustment challenges for men and women, heavily influenced by gender differences. Men often experience greater emotional distress and societal stigmas, while women typically have better coping mechanisms and support systems in place.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The phenomenon of late-life divorce, often referred to as "grey" or "silver" divorce, is on the rise, especially among individuals aged 50 and older. Research reveals that the emotional and psychological impacts of divorce significantly differ between genders. 

1. **Emotional Adjustment Challenges:** 
   - Studies show that men tend to have a more difficult time adjusting post-divorce compared to women. Men often face a profound sense of loneliness and a loss of purpose, as their identity is often tied to their roles as providers and protectors. This leaves them less equipped to cope with their new reality. 
   - On the contrary, women usually benefit from stronger emotional support networks. They tend to seek out family and friends readily and are more likely to express their emotions, which aids in their adjustment process.

2. **Coping Mechanisms:** 
   - Men often internalize emotions, leading to increased rates of depression and anxiety following a divorce. Despite societal perceptions, men can struggle significantly with feelings of loss and abandonment. They often find it difficult to navigate their newfound solitude.
   - Contrastingly, women generally have better coping strategies, disrupting the stereotype that they are the more emotionally vulnerable gender. They might utilize support groups or therapy to process their feelings. Additionally, data suggests that women often find ways to adjust their lives positively after divorce quicker than men.

3. **Life Satisfaction Changes:** 
   - Life satisfaction tends to decrease for both genders following a divorce; however, this decline is sharper for men, particularly if they lose a spouse. Conversely, menâ€™s life satisfaction increases with remarriage, while women's does not show the same trend. This reflects differences in relational dependencies and emotional recovery traits between genders. Women frequently seek fulfilling relationships that enhance their emotional well-being post-divorce.
   
4. **Support Structures:** 
   - After a late-life divorce, women may have more established support systems in place, facilitating emotional recovery and adaptation. In contrast, men may struggle with the social stigma surrounding divorce, which can hinder their ability to seek help and support during difficult times. Men might also find the transition into single life daunting, often referring to their homes and lives as empty post-divorce. 

In summary, late-life divorce presents a range of unique challenges influenced by longstanding gender differences in emotional expression and coping styles. 

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The growing rate of late-life divorce necessitates a closer examination of how men and women cope with these changes. As societal norms shift, more resources focused on helping men adapt to post-divorce life may be required, especially considering the important role that mental health plays in their overall adjustment.
