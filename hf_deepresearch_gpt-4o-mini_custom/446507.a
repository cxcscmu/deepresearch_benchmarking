### Changes When Cottage Industries Began to Disappear

1. **Economic Changes:**
   - The rise of factory production drastically shifted the economic landscape, concentrating manufacturing in urban areas and leading to a decline in rural self-sufficiency. This resulted in increased employment in factories but also loss of income for families who relied on cottage industries.

2. **Social Changes:**
   - As workers migrated from rural areas to urban centers for factory jobs, traditional family units and community structures were disrupted. This led to the erosion of rural lifestyles and community-based work systems, contributing to urban overcrowding.

3. **Technological Advancements:**
   - Mechanization and advancements in production technology significantly outpaced cottage industry methods. The introduction of machines made production faster and more cost-effective, leading to a preference for mass-produced goods.

4. **Cultural Shifts:**
   - The transition away from home-based production to factory work shifted the perception of labor, as factory jobs often came with strict hours and less autonomy compared to the flexibility of home-based work.

5. **Market Changes:**
   - Consumer preferences shifted towards the availability of affordable, mass-produced goods as opposed to handmade items from cottage industries. This change in demand further marginalized cottage production.

This synthesis illustrates that the decline of cottage industries was not just an economic shift but a profound transformation of society's structure, dynamics, and interactions with technology.
