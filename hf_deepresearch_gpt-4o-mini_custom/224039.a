### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Cambodian genocide, which lasted from April 17, 1975, to January 7, 1979, ended predominantly due to the Vietnamese invasion that overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Cambodian genocide was marked by the brutal dictatorship of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, from 1975 to 1979. During this period, the Khmer Rouge targeted various groups, including political dissidents, intellectuals, and ethnic minorities, resulting in approximately 1.5 to 2 million deaths due to executions, forced labor, and starvation. 

By the late 1970s, the regime faced increasing external tensions with Vietnam, leading to military conflicts. In December 1978, as the Khmer Rouge's hold weakened and the humanitarian crisis deepened, Vietnam launched an invasion. The Vietnamese forces sought to end the aggressive incursions from Khmer Rouge troops into Vietnam and the atrocities committed against the Cambodian populace. On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh, effectively ending the Khmer Rouge's reign and leading to the establishment of a new government formed by former Khmer communists who had fled to Vietnam. This invasion stabilized the region but kicked off a prolonged period of conflict and political turmoil in Cambodia.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The international response during the Cambodian genocide was notably inadequate; the United States and other nations largely failed to intervene. After the invasion, Cambodia remained under Vietnamese control until 1989, which led to ongoing internal strife that lasted for several years before a more stable government could be established.
