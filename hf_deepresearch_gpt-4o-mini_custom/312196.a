   - Both Africa and India experienced a combination of armed revolts and non-violent protests against colonial rule. 
   - In Africa, notable examples include the Chimurenga and the Maji-Maji Uprising, while in India, the Revolt of 1857 and the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi stand as significant examples.

2. **Cultural and Nationalistic Motivations**:
   - The resistance movements in both regions were deeply rooted in cultural identity, with a strong emphasis on nationalism. 
   - Leaders rallied people around the idea of preserving indigenous cultures and sovereignty, evident in the Asante Resistance in Ghana as well as the Swadeshi Movement in India.

3. **Influence of Key Leaders**:

   - Figures like Yaa Asantewaa in Africa and Mahatma Gandhi in India became symbols of resistance, inspiring collective action among their people.

4. **Responses to Economic Exploitation**:
   - Economic grievances were common. 
   - For instance, in Africa, the Maji-Maji Uprising arose as a response to forced labor, while in India, the salt tax led to significant protests during the Civil Disobedience Movement.

5. **Outcomes of Resistance**:
   - Ultimately, both regions achieved independence after prolonged struggles marked by resistance.
