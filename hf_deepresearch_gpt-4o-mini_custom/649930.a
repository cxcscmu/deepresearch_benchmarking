### 1. Southeast Asians and Diabetes
The prevalence of diabetes among Southeast Asians is rapidly increasing, with approximately 90 million adults living with diabetes in 2021, projected to rise to 113 million by 2030. Current estimates indicate that:
- About 46 million adults are undiagnosed, representing about 51% of the diabetic population.
- Diabetes in this region poses significant public health challenges, leading to approximately 747,000 deaths in 2021.
- Diabetes prevalence varies significantly among countries, with Malaysia at 16.7%, India at 10.4%, the Philippines at 7.1%, and Thailand at 7.0%.

The urgent need for enhanced diabetes management and preventive strategies is clear. Socioeconomic factors, urbanization, and cultural dietary habits all contribute to the rising rates.

### 2. Black Ethnicities and Diabetes
Diabetes prevalence among Black ethnicities, particularly non-Hispanic Black Americans, is significantly higher compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Key findings include:
- Non-Hispanic Blacks being 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared to non-Hispanic Whites.
- In 2018, the diabetes diagnosis rate was 13% for non-Hispanic Blacks compared to 8% for non-Hispanic Whites.
- Non-Hispanic Blacks were also reported to be twice as likely to die from diabetes than their White counterparts.
- The prevalence of related health issues, such as end-stage renal disease, shows that Black individuals were noted to be 3.2 times more likely to be diagnosed compared to their White peers.

Factors contributing to these disparities include genetics, socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and cultural dietary patterns. Public health initiatives need to be directed towards dietary education, improving healthcare accessibility, and addressing systemic barriers to reduce diabetes prevalence effectively.

### 3. Conclusion
In conclusion, both Southeast Asians and Black ethnicities face significant diabetes challenges that are tied to a combination of genetic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Tailored health interventions and ongoing research are crucial to mitigate these issues effectively.
