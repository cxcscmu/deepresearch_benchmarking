### Structured Report on the Causes of World War I

#### Long-Term Causes
1. **Nationalism**: Nationalistic fervor led to independence movements, especially among Slavic peoples in the Balkans.
2. **Militarism**: An arms race and an increased emphasis on military strength created an environment of suspicion and readiness for war.
3. **Alliances**: Complex alliances created entanglements that meant a conflict involving one nation could escalate to involve many others.
4. **Imperialism**: Competition for colonies created tensions and conflicts among European nations, leading to a fragile peace.

#### Short-Term Causes
- **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The assassination on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip triggered the July Crisis and highlighted nationalist tensions.
- **July Crisis**: A diplomatic breakdown following the assassination led to a rapid escalation of tensions, ultimately resulting in declarations of war.

#### Interconnection of Causes
The long-term causes created a precarious geopolitical landscape where the assassination served as the tipping point, igniting pre-existing tensions. The July Crisis illustrated a failure of diplomacy and the volatility of militaristic attitudes among nations, demonstrating that the complex web of alliances and national pride could rapidly lead to global conflict.

### Conclusion
The interplay of these long-standing and immediate causes culminated in a conflict that would significantly alter the political landscape of the 20th century, laying the groundwork for future rivalries and wars.
