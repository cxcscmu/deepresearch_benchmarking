### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Cities around the world are implementing free public transport systems with notable successes, particularly in Chambly, Canada; Tallinn, Estonia; and Kansas City, Missouri.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **Chambly, Canada**: Implemented free public transport in 2012, resulting in reduced road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative encouraged higher public transport ridership.

- **Tallinn, Estonia**: The first capital in the EU to offer free public transport starting in January 2013. Residents must acquire a ‘green card’ to take advantage of the system. Since its implementation, there has been a notable increase in registered residents. The initiative aims to decrease carbon emissions and improve social mobility. Mayor Edgar Savisaar praised the program, noting its positive impact on society’s social ties and the local economy.

- **Kansas City, Missouri**: Became the first major city in the U.S. to implement zero-fare transit, aimed at reducing pollution and boosting public transport usage. The program envisions making transport more accessible, especially for low-income residents, while addressing environmental concerns.

The growing trend of adopting free public transport systems is illustrated by the fact that approximately 100 cities globally have initiated this policy, with many in Europe seeing it as a feasible solution to urban challenges.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The success of these systems hinges on various factors, including local policies and public sentiment towards sustainability. Cities considering similar initiatives can learn from these pioneers, understanding both the benefits and the challenges they encountered during implementation.
