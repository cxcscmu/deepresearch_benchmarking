### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Stereotyping has numerous negative outcomes including decreased academic performance, increased anxiety, and long-lasting detrimental effects on individuals, as evidenced by various studies and examples.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Stereotyping, which involves oversimplified and generalized beliefs about individuals based on their group identity, leads to multiple negative outcomes:

1. **Decreased Academic Performance**: In a study where women were subjected to negative stereotypes while taking a math test, those who received derogatory stereotypes performed worse and showed increased hostility compared to those who were encouraged positively. This illustrates how negative stereotypes can undermine performance and foster aggression.

2. **Increased Anxiety and Impaired Performance**: Individuals like a female chemist may feel anxiety when faced with prevailing stereotypes about their capabilities, leading to poorer outcomes in competitive scenarios.

3. **Long-term Effects of Prejudice**: Research shows that people who feel they are being stereotyped perform poorly, and these effects can linger beyond immediate situations.

4. **Coping Challenges**: Stereotyping impacts individuals' self-esteem and mental health, causing difficulties in coping and social integration. For example, characters in literature often struggle with stereotypes in their social interactions.

5. **Broader Societal Impacts**: Racial discrimination and stereotyping hinder opportunities and morale in educational and workplace settings for people of color, affecting social cohesion.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Stereotyping is pervasive in various forms, affecting diverse groups in different contexts. Addressing the root causes of these stereotypes requires targeted interventions aimed at education and awareness to reduce their impact and promote inclusivity.
