### Structured Report on How Poverty Can be Solved

1. **Definitions of Poverty**:
   - **World Bank**: Poverty is defined as the condition where individuals are unable to meet basic needs for health, nutrition, and education, typically measured by living on less than $1.90 a day. It includes both absolute and relative poverty, acknowledging multidimensional aspects such as lack of education and healthcare.
   - **United Nations**: The UN defines poverty as a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity, including lack of basic capacity to participate in society, social exclusion, and insufficient access to basic services and opportunities.

2. **Current Global Poverty Statistics**:
   - As of 2023, approximately 700 million people globally live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress, driving approximately 120 million additional people into poverty, marking the first increase in global poverty rates in over two decades.

3. **Successful Poverty Reduction Programs**:
   - **Brazil's Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program**: Provides cash transfers contingent upon children's school attendance and health check-ups, covering millions of families and leading to a significant reduction in poverty and improved educational outcomes.
   - **Grameen Bank**: Offers microloans to impoverished individuals, primarily women, empowering them to start businesses and create economic independence.
   - **Mexico's Prospera Program**: Provides conditional cash transfers that incentivize education and health service utilization, resulting in improved educational and health metrics.
   - **India's Targeted Public Distribution System**: Supplies subsidized food grains to needy families, significantly enhancing food security and reducing hunger levels.

4. **Strategies for Poverty Alleviation**:
   - **Investments in Education and Healthcare**: Ensuring access to quality education and health services is essential for lifting families out of poverty.
   - **Conditional Cash Transfers**: Programs that provide financial incentives for attending school or health check-ups can directly impact poverty levels.
   - **Microfinance Initiatives**: Offering microloans can empower individuals to start businesses and increase income levels.
   - **Community Development Initiatives**: Engaging communities in the development process fosters localized solutions and addresses specific socio-economic needs.
   - **Integrated Approaches**: Combining health, education, and financial services to address various dimensions of poverty.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Solving poverty requires comprehensive strategies and collaborative efforts involving governments, NGOs, and communities. By adopting successful models and focusing on both immediate relief and long-term development, we can make significant strides toward eradicating poverty globally.
