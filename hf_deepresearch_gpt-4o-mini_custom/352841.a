### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The determination of fiscal policy is a cooperative effort among several key government bodies, primarily in the United States, involving both the executive and legislative branches such as the President, Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). State-level agencies also play a critical role in fiscal policy.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Fiscal policy refers to the government's decisions regarding taxation, spending, and borrowing aimed at influencing the economy. The responsibility of determining fiscal policy in the U.S. is shared among several entities:
  - **The President of the United States**: The President proposes the federal budget and outlines priorities for economic policy. The Secretary of the Treasury works closely with the President to manage federal finances.
  - **U.S. Congress**: Comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate, Congress has the authority to create laws that govern fiscal policy, which includes budget allocations and changes to tax laws through a vote.
  - **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)**: The OMB assists the President in preparing the federal budget and oversees its implementation across federal agencies. They evaluate the effectiveness of government programs and set funding priorities within the executive branch.
  - **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**: The CBO provides Congress with information on budgetary and economic issues, offering nonpartisan analyses to help lawmakers understand the implications of fiscal policy decisions. Created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, it aims to give Congress stronger oversight over budget matters.
  - **State-Level Agencies**: At the state level, agencies like the State Budget Agency play an essential role in fiscal policy. Governors propose budgets and recommend tax changes, and they are vital in managing state funds, assessing fiscal policies, and ensuring fiscal responsibility. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) tracks how states use federal funds to address fiscal challenges, especially in response to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating the dynamic nature of fiscal policy at the state level.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Fiscal federalism plays a crucial role in how federal funds interact with state policies. The interplay entails states receiving funds from the federal level, which significantly influences their fiscal decisions, particularly in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Thus, fiscal policy is not only a federal concern but also heavily impacts state governance and the broader economic landscape.
