### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The average time nurses spend on documentation using Electronic Health Records (EHR) is indicated to have increased notably post-EHR implementation, although specific minute averages were not conclusively found in the sources reviewed.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
A systematic review identified that nurses' documentation time increased from 9% to 23% of their total workload with the implementation of EHR systems. This translates into a significant commitment of time for documentation, but comprehensive statistics in minutes were scarce throughout the retrieved literature. A 2021 review highlighted that EHR systems contribute to documentation burdens resulting in clinician burnout, underscoring the need for further research in operationalizing this burden effectively. On average, physicians spend about 16 minutes per patient visit on EHR documentation, offering some context for the time nurses may similarly be expected to allocate.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Different healthcare settings might exhibit varying results based on organizational workflows and support systems in place, such as shared documentation responsibilities among care teams. Further targeted research focusing specifically on nursing documentation time is necessary to derive more precise averages.
