### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The rise in petrol prices has raised concerns among consumers and has prompted discussions around energy policies and fuel taxation, as the UK government evaluates measures to mitigate the impact on households. Experts indicate that unless oil output increases, prices may continue their relentless climb, affecting consumer spending and overall economic recovery. Furthermore, with inflation rates rising, the pressure on fuel prices is expected to persist throughout the year.
