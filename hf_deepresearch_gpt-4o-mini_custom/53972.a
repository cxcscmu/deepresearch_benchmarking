### Report on the Fusion of Equity and Common Law

#### 1. Historical Context
Equity law emerged in the 13th century as a corrective to the rigidities and injustices of common law, with the Court of Chancery established to administer justice based on fairness and conscience. Over time, equity and common law became intertwined, particularly with the Judicature Act of 1873, which allowed both doctrines to be applied in the same court. However, they maintained distinct identities, with equity focusing on justice and fairness in situations where common law was too rigid.

#### 2. Arguments For the Fusion of Equity and Common Law
1. **Consistency in Judicial Rulings**: A significant argument for fusion is to eliminate inconsistencies and ensure that similar cases lead to fair and just outcomes.
2. **Equitable Remedies Enhancing Justice**: The flexibility of equitable remedies allows courts to deliver justice in cases where common law may be unjust or rigid.
3. **Historical Evolution**: Given that legal practice often requires an interchange of principles from both equity and common law, a formal fusion could reflect current realities.

#### 3. Arguments Against the Fusion of Equity and Common Law
1. **Preserving Legal Principles**: Critics emphasize that equity serves as a necessary check on common law's rigidity. Blurring the lines could dilute the distinct roles of each system.
2. **Judicial Overreach Concerns**: Fusion could lead to judges exercising excessive discretion, undermining legislative authority and democracy.
3. **The Unique Function of Equity**: Equity addresses gaps in common law, ensuring justice, particularly in complex cases where rigid legal standards fail to provide adequate relief.

#### 4. Recent Case Law Examples
- **Earl of Oxford's Case (1615)**: Established that where there is a conflict between the rules of law and equity, equity prevails.
