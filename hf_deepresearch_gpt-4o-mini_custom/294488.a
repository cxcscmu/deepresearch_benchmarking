#### II. Ottoman Empire Policies
The Ottoman Empire initiated systematic deportation policies in April 1915, under the pretext of wartime security. The government, led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), conducted mass deportations, claiming they were necessary for safeguarding the state. Eyewitness accounts reveal immense suffering as military groups separated families and subjected Armenians to brutal conditions.

Armenians were misled into believing they would find safety, only to face violent deaths during forced marches into the Syrian desert, resulting in starvation and disease. Official military orders propelled the systematic violence that characterized this genocide.

These accounts offer critical insights into the atrocities inflicted on the Armenian population and highlight the importance of recognition and educational efforts about these historical injustices.

#### Conclusion

The policies enacted were systematic and premeditated, aiming to eradicate the Armenian people. Survivor testimonies provide necessary evidence for understanding and acknowledging the genocide, emphasizing the need for collective remembrance and commitment to preventing future atrocities.
