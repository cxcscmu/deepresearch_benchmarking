### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Children typically begin forming their own views around the age of 1-2 years and develop independent thinking skills progressively throughout their childhood, reaching significant milestones at ages 2-3, 5-7, and 11-13, with various strategies to foster this independence.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Children start to form their views as soon as they begin to recognize themselves and express preferences, typically around **ages 1-2**. At this age, they may begin to say “no” to requests and show basic decision-making.

By **ages 2-3**, children develop a better understanding of themselves as separate individuals, which fosters a deeper sense of independence. They exhibit growing preferences and emotional reactions to situations, indicating their ability to form personal opinions.

From **ages 5-7**, children enter Piaget's concrete operational stage, learning to understand more complex ideas and developing critical cognitive skills. They begin to focus on making decisions based on reasoning rather than solely on their immediate wants.

At **ages 7-8**, independence is further enhanced as children start seeking autonomy. This period is marked by their ability to understand rational outcomes, consider pros and cons, and begin articulating their viewpoints more clearly.

During the **tween years (ages 11-13)**, children transition into formal operational thinking, developing logic and deductive reasoning skills. They now engage more significantly in abstract thought, allowing them to form and defend personal views and opinions more robustly.

To foster independent thinking, several strategies can be implemented:
1. **Encourage Curiosity**: Allow children to ask questions and explore topics that interest them.
2. **Allow Choices**: Give them opportunities to make choices in their activities, fostering decision-making skills.
3. **Promote Problem-Solving Skills**: Present challenges that require critical thinking without offering immediate solutions.
4. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Use questions that inspire thoughtful responses rather than yes/no answers.
5. **Create a Supportive Environment**: Make mistakes part of learning and encourage children to express their thoughts freely.
6. **Encourage Reflection**: Discuss experiences and outcomes to help children learn from their actions.
7. **Incorporate Project-Based Learning**: Engage children in hands-on projects that require planning and execution.

### 3. Additional context:
These developmental milestones and strategies are essential in shaping a child’s ability to think independently and form opinions, equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate challenges in everyday life. Encouraging independence not only affects academic performance but also helps in social development as children learn to assert their viewpoints with confidence in various contexts.
