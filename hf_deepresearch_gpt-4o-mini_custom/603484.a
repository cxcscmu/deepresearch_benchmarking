### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The relationship between domestic terrorism and social media is characterized by the use of social media platforms for recruitment, organization, and the dissemination of extremist propaganda, with instances of significant domestic terrorist acts being significantly influenced by social media dynamics.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Domestic terrorism in the United States involves acts of violence aimed at civilians with political or ideological motives, executed by domestic individuals or groups without foreign direction. Key findings include:
- In 2019, there were at least 44 reported incidents of domestic terrorism linked to various extremist ideologies, including anti-government and racially motivated groups.
- The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social unrest have been linked to a notable rise in domestic terrorist activity. For example, the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack was notably coordinated through social media channels, illustrating how extremists leveraged these platforms to mobilize.
- According to reports, in 2020, there were 10,172 recorded terrorist attacks globally, marking increases in the total incidents compared to previous years, primarily affecting regions prone to political instability.
- Domestic violent extremism has gained recognition in threat assessments issued in 2021 by agencies such as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), highlighting a growing awareness of domestic threats along with traditional foreign terrorist organizations.
- The impact of social media regulation is significant, with platforms like Facebook attempting to control extremist content by implementing regulations like banning dangerous individuals and associations. However, these efforts often meet resistance and criticism over their effectiveness, leading to some extremists migrating to smaller, unregulated networks that self-promote as havens for free speech.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Despite increased awareness, challenges remain in combating online radicalization across expansive and varied social media landscapes. New extremist strategies continue to emerge, particularly as regulation adjusts to address the complexities of online interactions and the motivations behind domestic terrorist acts.
