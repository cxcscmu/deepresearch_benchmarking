Agile teams should make time for innovation based on the following principles and observations:

1. **Customer Satisfaction Through Continuous Delivery**: Allocating time for innovation ensures that teams are consistently delivering new and valuable features, enhancing customer satisfaction.

2. **Welcome Changing Requirements**: By embracing changes and adaptability, teams can explore innovative solutions that better meet emerging needs, even late in the development cycle.

3. **Frequent Delivery of Working Software**: Regular iterations allow teams to experiment and implement innovative ideas steadily rather than in a single, lengthy release.

4. **Collaboration and Communication**: Innovation thrives in environments that encourage open dialogue. Agile promotes close collaboration between team members, which can lead to new concepts and improvements.

5. **Self-Organizing Teams**: Promoting creative freedom amongst team members encourages them to explore different avenues for innovation, ensuring that time is allocated for experimenting with new ideas.

6. **Regular Reflections for Improvement**: Retrospectives should include discussions around innovation opportunities, allowing teams to pinpoint effective practices and areas needing creative exploration.

### Recommendations for Incorporating Innovation Time:
- Designate specific sprint cycles where team members are encouraged to work on innovative projects that do not directly relate to current tasks.
- Facilitate dedicated brainstorming sessions during sprint retrospectives or planning to identify opportunities for innovation.
- Implement a '15% time' approach, similar to Google, where employees can spend a portion of their work hours on projects of interest that could lead to innovations relevant to the team or product.

By embedding these practices into Agile processes, teams can foster an innovative mindset while maintaining focus on delivery and customer satisfaction.
