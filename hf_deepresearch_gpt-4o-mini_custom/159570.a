### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Feminism has evolved through distinct waves, with major milestones including the first wave focused on suffrage, the second wave addressing social inequalities with movements such as #MeToo, and ongoing advancements in intersectionality and legislative reforms for women's rights.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Feminism's historical journey can be observed through several waves:
1. **First Wave (1848-1920)**: This wave primarily focused on legal issues and women's suffrage, leading to significant achievements such as the right to vote in many countries, which marked a critical turning point for women's rights.

2. **Second Wave (1960s-1980s)**: Sparked by literature like Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique" (1963), this era raised issues related to reproductive rights, workplace equality, and sexual liberation. The second wave also saw the emergence of various feminist perspectives, including Black feminism and radical feminism, addressing not only gender but also race and societal structures.
   - Key developments such as the #MeToo movement began in 2017, raising widespread awareness about sexual harassment and discrimination, leading to significant legal reforms. As a result, 15 states in the US have passed new laws aimed at protecting women from workplace harassment and discrimination as a direct outcome of the movement.

3. **Third Wave (1990s-present)**: This wave focuses on individuality and diversity, emphasizing intersectionality. It responds to the challenges faced by women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups, advocating for a more inclusive feminist movement.
   - Advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights has become central, recognizing the unique intersections of gender identity and sexual orientation in the fight for equality.
   - Modern feminist activism often collaborates with other social justice movements, promoting global coalitions that address issues beyond gender such as climate change and economic inequality.
   - Notably, recent discussions around gender identity legislation highlight ongoing debates within feminism regarding biological sex and gender identity, illustrating the complexities faced today.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The social conditions underpinning the historical evolution of feminism can be traced through economic, political, and cultural changes across centuries. Feminism has continuously adapted to respond to systemic inequalities, igniting crucial dialogues that challenge traditional gender roles and aim to create inclusive spaces for all women. Recent movements and legislative changes reflect this ongoing struggle and highlight the importance of activism in pursuing justice.
