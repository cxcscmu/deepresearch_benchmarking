# Impact of Poverty on Healthcare

## 1. Poverty Statistics (2023)
As of 2023:
- More than 700 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day.
- Approximately 15,000 children die daily from preventable diseases related to poverty.
- Over 260 million children are not in school, which exacerbates the cycle of poverty.

## 2. How Poverty Affects Healthcare Access
Poverty significantly hinders access to healthcare, leading to disparities in health outcomes between low-income populations and their wealthier counterparts. Key points include:
- **Geographical Accessibility**: Healthcare facilities are often far from low-income areas.
- **Financial Barriers**: High costs of care deter individuals from seeking medical attention. Nearly 16.7% of Americans are uninsured.
- **Preventive Care**: Low-income individuals are less likely to receive preventive services (e.g., only 50% of women below the poverty level received mammograms).
- **Systemic Issues**: Policies often neglect the specific needs of low-income populations, leading to disparities in healthcare access.

## 3. Recommendations
- Implement targeted healthcare initiatives for impoverished communities.
- Engage both governmental and non-governmental organizations to provide better access to healthcare resources.
- Innovate financing strategies, such as health equity funds and conditional cash transfers, to aid low-income populations.
- Include marginalized communities in the design and implementation of healthcare policies to ensure their specific needs are met.

## Additional Context
The rising poverty rate and ongoing healthcare disparities highlight an urgent need for comprehensive reforms addressing both health access and economic conditions.
