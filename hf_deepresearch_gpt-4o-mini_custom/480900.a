{'Definition': "Immunosuppression refers to the reduction in the immune system's ability to fight infections and diseases. It can occur naturally or be induced for therapeutic reasons, particularly in the context of transplants or autoimmune diseases.", 'Causes': {'Medications': ['Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone)', 'Immunosuppressants for transplantation (e.g., cyclosporin, tacrolimus)'], 'Diseases': ['HIV/AIDS', 'Autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus)', 'Central nervous system infections'], 'Environmental': ['Pollution', 'Radiation', 'Lifestyle factors (poor diet, lack of sleep)']}, 'Prevalence': 'Approximately 3% of U.S. adults are immunosuppressed as of 2023.', 'Demographics': {'Age': 'Older adults (65+) show higher prevalence. Younger adults have lower rates.', 'Gender': 'Women report more autoimmune diseases; men are more associated with conditions requiring transplants.', 'Ethnicity': 'Certain minority groups (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics) exhibit higher rates of immunosuppression.'}, 'Implications': 'Understanding immunosuppression is vital for managing healthcare strategies and resource allocation.'}
