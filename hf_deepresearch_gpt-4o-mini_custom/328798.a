### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Public opinion on taxation in 2023 shows ongoing support for increased taxes on the wealthy, significant partisan divides on perceived fairness, and sustained disapproval of the 2017 tax cuts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In 2023, public opinion regarding taxation remains deeply divided and influenced by recent political history. Surveys indicate a continuing majority support among Americans for higher taxes on wealthy individuals to fund government initiatives. Prominent polling data shows that 64% of Republicans see the current tax system as fair, while only 32% of Democrats share this view, indicating a stark partisan divide that has widened in recent years. Only about a third of Americans approve of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), suggesting persistent discontent regarding the fairness and effectiveness of past tax reforms. This mixed sentiment reflects the ongoing debate around tax equity and the social contract surrounding fiscal obligations between citizens and government.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
While traditional measures of public opinion often suggest widespread disdain for taxes, research indicates a more nuanced view where many Americans recognize tax contributions as a civic duty. This research counters conventional beliefs and highlights that many Americans consider their tax contributions essential for community and societal support.
