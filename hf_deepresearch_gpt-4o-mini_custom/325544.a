### 1. Task outcome (short version):

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Employee turnover represents a significant challenge for organizations. Understanding the common reasons behind this phenomenon can provide insights for enhancing employee retention strategies. Among the prevalent reasons for employee turnover are:

1. **Employees Feel Underappreciated:** Many employees leave their jobs due to a lack of recognition for their contributions. Feeling unvalued can prompt them to seek roles in environments where their efforts are acknowledged.

2. **Lack of Proper Compensation:** Employees are likely to resign if they feel their salaries do not match their responsibilities or industry standards. Competitive remuneration is essential for retention.

3. **Insufficient Time Off:** Organizations that do not provide adequate leave may contribute to employee burnout, leading to higher turnover rates as individuals look for better work-life balance.

4. **Change in Management:** Transitions in leadership can disrupt established relationships and create uncertainty, often resulting in resignations.

5. **Outdated Machinery and Equipment:** Employees frustrated with inefficient tools may choose to leave rather than dealing with the everyday hassle of inadequate resources.

6. **Unrealistic Goals:** Constantly shifting expectations without support can demoralize employees and push them to resign.

7. **Lack of Management Support:** Employees desire guidance and support from their supervisors. A failure to provide this may result in increased turnover.

8. **Poor Company Culture:** A misalignment between employee values and company culture can lead to dissatisfaction and turnover.

9. **Limited Career Progression Opportunities:** If employees perceive stagnation in their career paths, they may seek opportunities elsewhere where growth is apparent.

10. **Industries-Specific Issues:** The drivers of turnover can differ dramatically depending on the industry, necessitating tailored strategies for retention. For instance, sectors like healthcare may face high turnover due to burnout, while retail often has turnover linked to low wages and high demands.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Reports indicate that turnover rates can range from 9% to 30%, depending on the industry. Employers must address these unique challenges to effectively manage retention strategies. The cost of losing an employee can amount to 16% to 213% of that employee's salary, emphasizing the financial implications of turnover. Understanding the specific turnover drivers and creating a supportive culture can turn attrition into attraction.
