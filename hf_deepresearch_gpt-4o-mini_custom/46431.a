### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The historical trends of demographic representation in the U.S. Congress reveal a gradual increase in diversity, particularly in terms of race and gender. The 117th Congress (2021) is the most diverse in history, with 23% of its members from racial and ethnic minorities and women making up 27.1% of Congress.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Over the years, the U.S. Congress has seen significant changes in its demographic representation:
- **Racial Diversity**: The 117th Congress consists of 124 lawmakers who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Native American, accounting for 23% of Congress. In comparison, in 1945, non-White lawmakers made up only 1%. The breakdown of the House of Representatives as of 2021 shows that 28% are from these groups, while they constitute approximately 39% of the U.S. population. This shift signals an improvement in representation but highlights ongoing disparities. The number of Asian representatives increased by 23% from the previous Congress.
- **Gender Representation**: The number of women in Congress reached a record high of 145, making up 27.1% of the total membership. This includes 24 women in the Senate and 121 in the House. However, this still falls short of reflecting women's overall percentage in the U.S. population (around 50.5%). Women have been steadily increasing their presence in Congress, although they continue to be underrepresented.
- **Age**: The representation of younger generations has increased slightly, with Millennials accounting for about 7% of the House. Despite this, Congress remains older on average, with a median age that has gradually increased over the decades.
- **Future Implications**: With the U.S. projected to become a majority-minority nation by 2045, the trends in Congress could continue to evolve, potentially leading to greater efforts for inclusion and representation from diverse communities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Historical legislative and societal changes, such as the Voting Rights Act and various feminist movements, have influenced these demographic shifts. Understanding these trends is crucial for comprehending the evolving nature of representation and policymaking in the U.S. The ongoing change in Congress reflects broader societal changes, making it imperative for underrepresented groups to continue advocating for their interests.
