The Cold War significantly influenced American foreign and domestic policies. Key foreign policies focused on containing communism through initiatives like the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and NATO, culminating in major conflicts like the Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Domestically, the Cold War amplified the civil rights movement's urgency, influenced legislation, and created a climate of McCarthyism, all while fostering increased activism and a cultural shift centered around anti-communism.
