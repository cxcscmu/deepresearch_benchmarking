### Responses of East Francia and England to Viking Attacks

#### Overview
The Viking Age (approximately 793-1066 AD) saw extensive Viking incursions into Europe, particularly in regions such as East Francia and England. The responses from these areas were shaped by their political structures, military capabilities, and socio-economic conditions.

#### Responses in England
1. **Military Engagements**: England's Viking challenges began with the raid on Lindisfarne in 793 AD. Over the decades, the Great Heathen Army surged into England, leading to several notable encounters.
   - **Battle of Edington (878)**: Alfred the Great achieved a significant victory against the Viking king, Guthrum. This battle resulted in the Treaty of Wedmore, which recognized Viking rule in parts of England but established boundaries for peace.
  
2. **Diplomatic Strategies**: Beyond victories, Henry used treaties (like the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum) as tools for defining territorial limits and establishing peaceful trade.

3. **Cultural Integrations**: The establishment of the Danelaw led to Viking laws coexisting with Anglo-Saxon traditions, fostering a blend of cultures and governance.

#### Responses in East Francia
1. **Defensive Preparations**: East Francia maintained different tactics owing to its decentralized authority. Fortifications were built, and localized militia forces (lantweri) defended against raids.
   - **Military Tactics**: Kings utilized coastal guards as monitors against Viking raids. Military engagements were less centralized than in England.

2. **Diplomatic Efforts**: King Charles the Simple engaged in negotiations, resulting in rewarding Viking leaders like Rollo with territory (Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, 911), thereby integrating them into the political framework.

3. **Consequences of Treaties**: Unlike the Anglo-Saxon integration of Vikings through law and culture, East Francia's treaties resulted in stable territories but led to significant power shifts, including the emergence of Normandy.

#### Comparative Analysis
While both England and East Francia faced similar threats, their responses illustrate key differences:
- **Military vs. Diplomatic Balance**: England focused on decisive military victories and subsequent commitments through treaties, while East Francia's strategies often centered around negotiations and granting territories to Viking leaders.
- **Cultural Melding**: England's Danelaw reflects a deeper cultural integration of Viking customs, whereas East Francia's approach led to the introduction of Viking governance without equal cultural assimilation.

#### Conclusion
The Viking invasions significantly impacted the political and social landscapes of both East Francia and England. The responses included military engagements and treaties, which helped shape the future of European governance and culture. The differing outcomes, particularly between the establishment of the Danelaw and the creation of Normandy, highlight the adaptive strategies of both regions in response to the Viking threat.
