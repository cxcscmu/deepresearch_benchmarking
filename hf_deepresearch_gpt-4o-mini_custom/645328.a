### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Organizational Culture Definition:**  
Organizational culture refers to the collective beliefs, values, and norms that influence how employees within an organization interact and work together. It encapsulates the organizationâ€™s personality and encompasses the underlying assumptions that guide actions and decisions.

**Components of Organizational Culture:**  
1. **Values:** Core principles that guide an organization's decisions and actions.
2. **Norms:** Unwritten rules and expectations that govern behavior within the organization.
3. **Artifacts:** Visible elements such as dress code, office layout, and rituals that represent the culture.
4. **Underlying Assumptions:** Deeply embedded perceptions and beliefs that shape the organization's culture and are often taken for granted.

**Key Frameworks:**  
- **Schein's Model of Organizational Culture:** This model consists of three levels of culture: 
  1. **Artifacts:** The visible symbols and signs of culture.
  2. **Espoused Values:** The explicitly stated values and norms that are preferred.
  3. **Basic Underlying Assumptions:** Implicit beliefs that are taken for granted and dictate how members behave.

- **Hofstede's Dimensions of Culture:** A framework that categorizes cultures based on six dimensions, including: 
  1. **Process-oriented vs. Results-oriented**  
  2. **Job-oriented vs. Employee-oriented**  
  3. **Professional vs. Parochial**  
  4. **Open Systems vs. Closed Systems**  
  5. **Tightly vs. Loosely Controlled**  
  6. **Pragmatic vs. Normative**

- **Competing Values Framework:** Developed by Robert Quinn and Kim Cameron, this framework categorizes organizational cultures based on two dimensions: flexibility vs. control and internal vs. external focus. It identifies four culture types: Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy.

**Recent Trends in Organizational Culture:**  
1. **Flexibility Rules:** The shift to remote work and hybrid models demands organizations create culture that offers flexibility in how and where employees work.
2. **Employee Voice and Participation:** Organizations are increasingly involving employees in decision-making processes.
3. **Focus on Inclusivity and Diversity:** With the growing awareness of the importance of inclusive cultures, organizations prioritize diverse hiring and inclusive practices.
4. **Mental Health and Wellbeing:** There is an increasing recognition of the role that organizational culture plays in employee wellbeing and mental health.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the dynamics of organizational culture is crucial not just for employee satisfaction but also for overall organizational effectiveness. Leaders who foster a healthy culture can drive innovation, improve productivity, and reduce turnover.
