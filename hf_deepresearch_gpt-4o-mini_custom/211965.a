{'short_version': 'Litter has significant environmental impacts, harming wildlife, polluting ecosystems, and causing socio-economic burdens. Different types of litter (plastic, glass, metal, and organic waste) pose unique threats to the environment and public health.', 'detailed_version': '\n1. **Plastic Waste**: Plastic debris causes severe threats to wildlife, particularly marine life, with about 9 billion tons entering oceans each year. Animals ingest plastics mistaking them for food, leading to death. Plastics also alter aquatic habitats and increase harmful algal blooms, which can degrade water quality.\n\n2. **Glass and Metal**: While often recyclable, glass and metal persist in the environment, leaching toxins into soil and water. Broken items can physically harm wildlife.\n\n3. **Organic Waste**: Attracts pests and diseases while leading to nutrient overloads that deplete oxygen levels in water bodies, causing death to aquatic life.\n\n4. **Cigarette Butts**: The most littered item worldwide, leaching harmful chemicals. They make up over one-third of all litter and can take years to decompose.\n\n5. **Socio-economic Effects**: Municipalities spend millions on cleanup, diverting funds away from essential services. Public health risks arise from contaminated water sources.\n    ', 'additional_context': '\nInitiatives to reduce littering, such as community clean-up, accessible waste disposal, fines for littering, and educational programs, are crucial. Effective management of littering is essential not just for environmental protection but also for public health and economic well-being.\n    '}
