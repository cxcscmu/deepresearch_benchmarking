### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Adolescent health issues significant in 2023 include mental health disorders affecting 1 in 7 adolescents globally, obesity affecting 17.8% of youths aged 2-19 in the US, and substance abuse affecting 10.7% of adolescents.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Mental Health:** In 2019, it was reported by UNICEF that approximately 166 million adolescents (1 in 7) globally experience mental disorders. This includes roughly 89 million boys and 77 million girls. Mental health conditions represent a critical challenge during this formative period and have lasting implications for an individual's development.

**Obesity:** According to Healthy People 2030, as of 2013-2016, around 17.8% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 in the United States were classified as obese. This figure underscores the ongoing challenge of obesity within this demographic, with a target reduction goal set at 15.5%.

**Substance Abuse:** The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in 2013 estimated that 10.7% of adolescents experienced a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year, with 38.1% of these adolescents receiving treatment. Furthermore, it reported that 2.2 million adolescents (aged 12-17) were current illicit drug users, and 1.6 million had engaged in binge drinking within the past month.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
These health statistics highlight a pressing need for intervention and support systems that target these issues among adolescents. Strategies could include strengthening mental health resources, improving nutritional programs, and enhancing education on substance abuse prevention. Engaging parents, educators, and healthcare professionals in discussions and initiatives surrounding these topics could foster a healthier environment for adolescents.
