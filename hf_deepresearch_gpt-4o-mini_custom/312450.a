### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Cold War has left a profound political and economic impact on modern global issues, characterized by ongoing geopolitical tensions, unresolved conflicts, and the legacy of economic strategies that continue to shape international relations today.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Cold War, spanning from 1945 to 1991, established a bipolar world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. It resulted in not only significant geopolitical changes but also profound economic implications that are still felt today.

- **Political Impact:**  The ideological divide between capitalism and communism has created lasting political tensions across the globe, influencing contemporary conflicts and alliances. For instance, the remnants of Cold War politics can be seen in regions like the Middle East, where U.S. involvement can be traced back to Cold War interventions against Soviet influence.

- **Economic Impact:** The Cold War led to a U.S. economic model characterized by high consumerism and low savings, aimed at outpacing and exhausting Soviet resources. Post-Cold War, countries once divided are grappling with economic disparities rooted in these historical alliances.

- **Geopolitical Issues:** Many present-day conflicts stem from unresolved issues stemming from the Cold War, such as the situation in North Korea, ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe (especially Ukraine), and the rise of radical Islamic terrorism, which has its roots in Cold War interventions in Afghanistan.

- **Legacy of Nuclear Threats:** The Cold War also set the stage for modern nuclear politics, with existing arsenals remaining a global threat. Many regions are still affected by the geopolitical instability and fears of nuclear confrontation.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Today, the ideological battles and political language from the Cold War era shape contemporary political discourse, leading to increased polarization in various regions. The global power structure has shifted again, with the rise of nations like China, which now challenge the U.S. in the arena once dominated by the U.S.-Soviet rivalry.
Furthermore, the enduring U.S. embargo against Cuba serves as a specific case of the Cold Warâ€™s lingering effects, illustrating how historical conflicts can persist long after the initial tensions have subsided.
