Standardized tests have historically influenced college admissions, often perpetuating socio-economic and racial inequalities. However, the increasing adoption of alternative assessments (such as portfolios and performance-based interviews) reflects a shift towards more equitable evaluation methods. These alternatives not only promote critical thinking and creativity but also address the limitations of standardized tests as predictors of student success. By embracing both standardized tests and alternative assessments, educational institutions can provide a more holistic view of student potential, ensuring broader access and fairness in admissions processes.
