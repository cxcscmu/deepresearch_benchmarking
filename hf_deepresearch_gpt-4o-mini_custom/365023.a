### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The major treaties signed at the end of World War I, including the Treaty of Versailles, profoundly altered the territorial boundaries in Europe and had significant political ramifications, leading to instability and the rise of new countries while sowing the seeds for future conflicts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
#### Major Treaties:
1. **Treaty of Versailles (1919)**
   - Signed on June 28, 1919, between Germany and the Allied Powers.
   - **Key Terms:** 
     - Germany lost territories including Alsace-Lorraine to France, Eupen and Malmedy to Belgium, and parts of Prussia to Poland.
     - The Saar Basin was put under League of Nations control, and Germany lost all overseas colonies.
     - Military restrictions limited the German army and navy.
     - Germany had to pay reparations and accept full responsibility (War Guilt Clause).
     - The establishment of the League of Nations aimed to prevent future conflicts.

2. **Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919)**
   - Signed September 10, 1919, it recognized the independence of several nations previously part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
   - Austria could not unify with Germany and was limited in military size.
   - Territorial losses included lands ceded to Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

3. **Treaty of Trianon (1920)**
   - Signed June 4, 1920, focusing on Hungary.
   - Established significant territorial losses to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, effectively diminishing Hungary's role.
   - Military restrictions were also imposed.

4. **Treaty of Sèvres (1920)**
   - Signed August 10, 1920, aimed to partition the Ottoman Empire and established mandates for Britain and France in the Middle East.
   - Recognized Armenian and Kurdish aspirations.

5. **Treaty of Lausanne (1923)**
   - Signed July 24, 1923, it defined modern Turkey's borders and repealed some terms of Sèvres, solidifying Turkey's sovereignty.

#### Territorial Impacts:
- German territories were reduced by approximately 13% of its pre-war size, with significant regions lost to neighboring countries aiding the formation of new nations like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
- New nations arose, including Finland, Poland, and Hungary, altering the political landscape of Europe significantly.

#### Political Ramifications:
- The harsh penalties and territorial losses imposed on Germany fostered a climate of resentment, leading to economic hardship and the eventual rise of extremist political movements, including Fascism and Hitler’s regime.
- The exclusion of Germany from the League of Nations and its perceived humiliation laid the groundwork for future conflicts, including World War II.
- The political landscape was dramatically transformed with empires collapsing and new ideologies emerging, along with calls for international cooperation through frameworks like the League of Nations, though many nations were hesitant or resistant to this idea.

### 3. Additional context:
The treaties were intended to establish a framework for future peace and cooperation, reflecting Wilson’s Fourteen Points. However, they have been criticized for their punitive nature, particularly towards Germany. This complex interplay of new national identities, territorial disputes, and unresolved grievances ignited nationalist sentiments and ethnic tensions, which have continued to influence European politics into the modern era.
