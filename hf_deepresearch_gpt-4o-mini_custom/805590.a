### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Algeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962, after a brutal war that began with increased nationalist sentiments following World War II and culminated in a violent struggle for liberation.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
1. **Colonization (1830-1954)**: France invaded Algeria in 1830, enforcing colonial rule and subjugation over the local population. By 1847, France successfully quelled local uprisings, and Algeria was declared formally integral to France. Over the following decades, European settlers, known as *pieds-noirs*, were given preferential treatment.

2. **Rise of Nationalism (1930s-1945)**: The nationalist movement began to take shape with the formation of several political parties. The Parti du Peuple Algérien (PPA) was established in March 1937. Post-World War II, in 1945, demonstrations in Sétif demanding independence led to massacres where thousands of Muslims were killed, catalyzing further unrest.

3. **The Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962)**: This war formally started on November 1, 1954, led by the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN), which targeted both military and civilian populations, marking the initiation of asymmetric warfare.
- **Major Events**:
     - May 8, 1945: Massacre in Sétif during VE Day celebrations.
     - November 1, 1954: FLN launches coordinated attacks throughout Algeria.
     - August 1955: The Philippeville massacre, where FLN attacks provoke brutal counteractions from French authorities.
     - 1956-1957: The Battle of Algiers, highlighting urban guerrilla warfare.
     - 1961: Start of negotiations between the French government and the FLN as the war shifted public opinion in France against the conflict.
     - March 18, 1962: Ceasefire established with the Evian Accords, leading to a formal agreement.

4. **Independence (1962)**: After intense and prolonged conflict, Algeria officially achieved independence on July 5, 1962, as announced by French President Charles de Gaulle. The process significantly redefined the political landscape in Africa, influencing other decolonization movements.

### 3. Additional Context:
Algeria's struggle for independence was marked by significant human rights abuses and violence, and it became a symbol of colonial resistance worldwide. The war had lasting implications, not only for Algeria but also for France, which faced criticism for its colonial policies and military actions. This event is often studied in the context of the broader decolonization movement that swept across Africa in the mid-20th century.
