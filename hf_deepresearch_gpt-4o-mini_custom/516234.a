### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Research indicates that students often have negative feelings towards research papers due to the time-consuming nature of the writing process, the extensive reading required, and the challenges associated with the structure of research papers.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Students frequently express discomfort and negative feelings towards research papers for several reasons:

- **Time-Consuming Nature**: Many students perceive research papers as highly time-consuming tasks that can detract from other academic responsibilities and personal interests. The feeling that they are required to read numerous articles to support a single fact contributes to frustration.

- **Compounded Efforts in Research**: The pressure to base their writing on extensive research comes across as unrelatable and arduous. Students often find the requirement to synthesize multiple sources daunting, leading to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety about the authenticity of their work.

- **Complex Structure**: The rigid structure of typical research papers can be intimidating, causing students to struggle with formatting and organization. This perceived complexity may deter their engagement with the material and deepen negative attitudes toward the writing process.

- **Widespread Plagiarism**: As a consequence of their distaste for writing research papers, some students resort to practices like plagiarism. This reflects not only their challenges with the writing process but also a deeper engagement with negative feelings regarding the necessity and purpose of such assignments.

- **Attitudinal Dimensions**: A study exploring the multidimensional nature of attitudes towards research identified five key factors influencing students' perceptions. These included their level of confidence in writing, perceived usefulness of research activities, previous experiences with research, perception of expectations from instructors, and personal inclination towards collaborative work.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Given these negative perceptions, educators are encouraged to find ways to address students' concerns regarding research papers. Implementing collaborative assignments, providing clearer guidelines, and reducing workload pressures could foster more positive attitudes toward research methodologies and writing. Furthermore, qualitative insights into students' experiences might present valuable considerations for enhancing their engagement and perceptions.
