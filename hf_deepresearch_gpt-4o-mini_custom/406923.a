### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Common reasons for team failure in organizations include lack of trust, poor leadership, unclear goals and roles, inadequate resources, and ineffective processes. These factors can prevent teams from achieving their objectives and negatively impact morale and productivity.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):

1. **Absence of Trust**: Team cohesion often falters when there is a lack of trust among members. Team members should feel confident in one another's commitment and abilities. Without trust-building activities, team engagement decreases.

2. **Individual Rewards Over Team Rewards**: When individual achievements are incentivized over team success, it can splinter the group, undermining collective morale and collaboration.

3. **Unprepared Leadership**: Incompetent leadership can lead directly to team failure by introducing stress, ineffective communication, and disorientation. Poorly managed teams often struggle to meet their goals due to lack of guidance.

4. **Misunderstanding of Team Dynamics**: Confusion between teams and workgroups can lead to ineffective functioning. Teams need shared goals and a defined purpose, unlike workgroups, which may not have a cohesive strategy.

5. **Lack of Vision**: Without a shared vision, teams may struggle for direction, resulting in disengagement and misalignment of efforts.

6. **Unclear Roles and Responsibilities**: Ambiguity in role definition can cause frustration and inefficiency, as members may not know what is expected of them or how to collaborate effectively.

7. **Insufficient Resources**: Without adequate resources—such as time, budget, and training—teams are set up to fail right from the start.

8. **Environmental Influences**: Teams spread across different locations can face challenges in communication and collaboration. Utilizing technology can help overcome distance-related issues.

9. **Poor Goal Setting and Communication**: Lack of involvement in goal-setting or ineffective communication can lead to a lack of ownership and team cohesion. Everyone must understand their objectives to work harmoniously.

10. **Lack of Mutual Accountability and Shared Leadership**: Teams must hold each other accountable for their commitments and share responsibility for the team's success. A failure in these areas can lead to diminished trust and respect.

11. **Inability to Handle Conflict**: Poor strategies for conflict resolution can lead to unresolved issues, tension, and ultimately team dysfunction.

12. **Ineffective Processes**: Having in place poor decision-making processes or ineffective meetings can lead to wasted time and energy, which impede progress toward objectives.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Studies show alarming statistics about team dysfunction: approximately 60% of work teams fail to meet their performance goals. Organizations can enhance team effectiveness by addressing these common pitfalls, ensuring clear leadership, definition of roles, and an emphasis on shared goals and resources.
