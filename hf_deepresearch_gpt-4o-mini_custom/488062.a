### Report on Future Problems Resulting from Scarce Resources

#### 1. Introduction
Resource scarcity is a significant global issue, encompassing essential areas such as water, food, and minerals. This scarcity is driven by various factors, including population growth, climate change, and unsustainable consumption patterns. As resources dwindle, the following problems are anticipated to become increasingly pressing.

#### 2. Key Problems Arising from Resource Scarcity

**2.1 Water Scarcity**
- **Projected Impact**: By 2025, approximately 1.8 billion people are expected to experience severe water scarcity. This could lead to:
  - Increased conflict over water rights and access, particularly in regions with shared water sources.
  - Public health crises driven by inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation, potentially resulting in higher rates of waterborne diseases.
  - Economic repercussions for agriculture and industries reliant on consistent water supply, leading to food insecurity and job losses.

**2.2 Food Insecurity**
- **Projected Impact**: Food demand is projected to rise between 35-56% by 2050, exacerbating the challenges of food insecurity. Consequences may include:
  - Increased hunger and malnutrition for millions, particularly among vulnerable populations in low-income nations.
  - Heightened competition for land and resources, leading to social unrest and potential conflict over food supplies.
  - Pressure on agricultural systems to adopt unsustainable practices that can degrade land and biodiversity, further threatening food security.

**2.3 Mineral Shortages**
- **Projected Impact**: The mining industry is poised to face potential shortages of essential minerals, particularly those critical for technology and renewable energy. Issues may involve:
  - Increased costs and supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and reliance on specific mineral sources.
  - Economic challenges for industries dependent on these minerals, which could hinder technological advancement and impact sectors important for sustainable development (e.g., renewable energy systems).
  - Potential rise in illegal mining practices and environmental degradation as nations scramble for access to dwindling mineral resources.

#### 3. Innovations and Strategies to Address Scarcity
Innovative approaches and sustainable practices are essential for mitigating the impacts of resource scarcity:
- **Water Management**: Implementation of advanced technologies (e.g., smart meters) and community engagement strategies can enhance water efficiency. Successful case studies like those of the SFPUC illustrate effective stakeholder involvement in water resource management.
  
- **Food Production**: Innovations in sustainable agricultural practices, such as Comet Bio's upcycling of agricultural waste and the use of sustainable packaging alternatives, showcase how the food sector can adapt to meet rising demands sustainably.

- **Mineral Resource Management**: Companies like Iluka and Rio Tinto demonstrate how technology integration and optimization can support operational efficiency and resource sustainability in mineral extraction practices.

#### 4. Conclusion
The challenges posed by resource scarcity are multifaceted, requiring a coordinated response from governments, industries, and communities. Sustainable practices, technological advancements, and active community engagement are pivotal in addressing these issues. As the global population continues to grow, ensuring the availability of vital resources will be critical for maintaining societal stability and promoting environmental sustainability. 

This report serves as a guide for stakeholders to understand the urgency of addressing resource scarcity and the potential paths forward to foster resilience in resource management.
