{'short version': 'Obesity has evolved into a significant global health issue since the 1980s, with its prevalence doubling worldwide. Historically, obesity was less common and primarily linked to societal shifts in diet and lifestyle, escalating from food scarcity to overindulgence.', 'detailed version': 'The history of obesity as a health issue dates back to the late 20th century, when it gained recognition as a public health crisis. Since 1980, global obesity rates have more than doubled, with approximately 13% of adults classified as obese (BMI â‰¥ 30). The World Health Organization defines obesity according to BMI, highlighting its serious health risks, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Prior to 1980, obesity was less prevalent; surveys indicated that a majority of adults maintained a normal or underweight BMI. This shift is attributed to changes in diet, particularly increases in fat and sugar consumption, and a more sedentary lifestyle as industrialization progressed. In America, the patterns of food consumption evolved from concerns of food scarcity in earlier generations to a modern-day overabundance. Historically, obesity depicted in early cultures often represented wealth and affluence. Notably, representations from 33,000 B.C. showed obese figures, suggesting societal attitudes towards body image varied greatly through different eras. Numerous studies and reports have documented this progression, revealing the complex interplay of societal, economic, and environmental factors contributing to the obesity epidemic. Obesity is now a focal point for public health policies aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles to mitigate its impacts and address the dietary crisis we face today.', 'additional context': 'Understanding the evolution of obesity helps shape future policies and health strategies. It is crucial to consider how socio-economic factors, cultural norms, and dietary practices have influenced obesity rates historically and continue to do so today. Future initiatives must acknowledge these historical contexts to effectively combat obesity.'}
