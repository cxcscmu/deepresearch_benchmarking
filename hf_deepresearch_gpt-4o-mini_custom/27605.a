The American Dream for immigrants is a nuanced concept; some achieve it through hard work and resilience, but many face persistent challenges. Approximately 44.8 million immigrants live in the U.S., making up 13.7% of the population. Educational attainment among immigrants is rising, yet significant poverty levels persist, with 41% living in or near poverty. Success stories from figures like Thomas Petterffy and Kazi Mannan highlight possibilities, but systemic barriers remain. The American Dream is still alive but increasingly contested among immigrant populations, requiring unyielding efforts for inclusivity and equitable opportunities.
