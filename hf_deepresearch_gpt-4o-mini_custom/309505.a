### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Glorious Revolution of 1688 was primarily caused by the political, religious, and social tensions that arose during the reign of James II, culminating in his deposition and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy under William III and Mary II.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Glorious Revolution of 1688 was a pivotal event in English history that resulted from a complex interplay of political, religious, and social factors. The reign of James II, who was openly Catholic in a predominantly Protestant country, triggered an intense backlash among various political factions. James's attempts to subvert the power of Parliament and appoint Catholics to high positions heightened fears of a return to absolute monarchy and Catholic domination.

The turning point was the birth of James's son in June 1688, which stirred fears of a Catholic dynasty. In response, seven prominent political leaders, including both Whigs and Tories, extended an invitation to William of Orange to invade England and restore Protestant rule. William's successful invasion in November 1688 was largely unopposed as many soldiers and nobles defected to his cause.

William and Maryâ€™s accession marked the end of James's reign and ushered in a new political order characterized by a constitutional monarchy that limited the powers of the king and cemented the role of Parliament in governance.

Socially, the memories of the civil war and a desire to avoid further conflict influenced public opinion against James II. The fear of instability and chaos propelled many to support William's cause, aiming for stability and the protection of Protestantism.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Glorious Revolution set the stage for future developments in Britain, including the evolution of the parliamentary system and the gradual increase of civil rights. The Bill of Rights 1689 ensured that Parliament had significant control over the monarchy, changing the landscape of English governance permanently.
