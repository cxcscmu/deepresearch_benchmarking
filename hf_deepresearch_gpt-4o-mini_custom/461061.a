Report on the Consequences of Rising Inflation


As of late 2023, specific inflation figures for the USA are still pending definitive release, but trends from past years indicate significant spikes in inflation:
1. **Mid-1970s**: Inflation surged post-1973 oil crisis, peaking at around 11%.
2. **Late 1970s to early 1980s**: Inflation reached 14.8% in 1980, leading to a recession.
3. **Recent Period (2021-2023)**: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 due to disrupted supply chains, labor shortages, and extensive fiscal stimulus measures.


The impact of rising inflation can be understood through several core aspects:
1. **Purchasing Power**: Inflation decreases the purchasing power, making it harder for consumers to afford the same goods and services as before.
2. **Consumer Behavior**:
   - **Inflationary Psychology**: Consumers may start spending now to avoid higher future prices, often leading to increased demand and further inflation.
   - **Keynesian View**: Inflation increases when demand outpaces supply, prompting spending adjustments within the consumer market.
3. **Investment Decisions**: Investors often seek to preserve their returns against inflation by gravitating toward real assets, altering traditional portfolio strategies.


Several economic theories help explain the dynamics of inflation:
1. **Quantity Theory of Money**: Suggests a direct relationship between money supply and price levels.
2. **Keynesian Theory**: Focuses on demand exceeding supply as a primary driver of inflation.
3. **Monetarism**: Stresses the importance of controlling money supply to manage inflation.
4. **Structuralism**: Explains inflation in developing economies due to structural factors limiting supply.
