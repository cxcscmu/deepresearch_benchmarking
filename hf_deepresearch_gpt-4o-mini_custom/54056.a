### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The major treaties established after World War II that shaped international relations include the United Nations Charter, NATO, the Treaty of Rome, and the Helsinki Accords. Each treaty played a crucial role in promoting peace, security, human rights, and economic cooperation.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **United Nations Charter (1945)**: This foundational document established the UN, promoting international cooperation and peace. It outlines member state obligations, the principle of collective security, and the importance of respecting sovereignty and human rights. Its provisions have become the bedrock of international law and diplomacy, influencing global governance.

- **NATO (1949)**: The North Atlantic Treaty was signed to establish a collective defense alliance against Soviet aggression. This treaty solidified military cooperation among Western nations, reinforcing political ties. NATO's collective security commitment (Article 5) acts as a deterrent against external threats, significantly affecting security dynamics in Europe and beyond, particularly during the Cold War and subsequent conflicts.

- **Treaty of Rome (1957)**: This treaty laid the groundwork for the European Economic Community (EEC), ultimately leading to the European Union. It promoted economic integration among member states, fostering cooperation and economic stability in Europe. The principles of free movement of goods, services, people, and capital are central to the EU's functioning today, marking a significant evolution in regional cooperation.

- **Helsinki Accords (1975)**: This diplomatic breakthrough aimed to ease Cold War tensions by establishing principles for peaceful coexistence and human rights. The Accords legitimized dissident movements in Eastern Europe, facilitated dialogue between East and West, and affirmed the inviolability of borders. Their legacy influenced the eventual fall of communist regimes by empowering grassroots movements advocating for reform and human rights.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
These treaties not only shaped the post-World War II order but also continue to influence contemporary international relations. They exemplify how diplomacy, multilateralism, and cooperation can address global challenges, uphold human rights, and promote peace.
