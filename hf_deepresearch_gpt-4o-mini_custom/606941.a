## Causes of the Syrian Civil War: A Comprehensive Report

### 1. Introduction
The Syrian civil war, which erupted in 2011 as part of the wider Arab Spring movement, evolved into a complex and destructive conflict involving various factions, international powers, and significant humanitarian crises.

### 2. Historical Background
Syria's political landscape before the civil war was characterized by authoritarian rule under the Ba'ath Party, significant social divisions, and an economy that exhibited both growth and deep-seated poverty. The populace was largely Sunni Muslim, with substantial minority communities. Dism satisfaction with the regime, facing repression and lack of political freedoms, laid the groundwork for protests in 2011.

### 3. Key Events that Sparked the Uprising
- **March 2011**: Protests began in Daraa, following the arrest of youths for anti-government graffiti. Security forces responded with extreme violence.
- **April 2011**: Protests spread nationwide, leading to violent crackdowns.
- **August 2011**: International condemnation, including calls for Assad's resignation from the U.S.
- **December 2011**: Formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), marking the transition from peaceful protests to armed rebellion.
- **2014-2018**: The rise of ISIS and significant battles such as Aleppo and Raqqa, involving major international military interventions.

### 4. International Response
The response from the international community includes military actions led by the U.S. and Russia, numerous humanitarian actions, and attempts at diplomatic negotiations. However, geopolitical interests often complicated cohesive action:
- **Military**: The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against ISIS and retaliatory strikes against the Assad regime for chemical attacks.
- **Humanitarian Aid**: The UN and various NGOs provided significant assistance, addressing the needs of millions displaced by the conflict.

### 5. Ongoing Situation and Conclusions
As of 2023, the conflict persists with ongoing violence and a dire humanitarian crisis defined by displacement of millions. Efforts for a political resolution remain complicated by the fractured state of both the opposition and foreign involvement.

This report reflects a synthesis of the diverse factors contributing to the Syrian civil war and the international community's reaction to one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history.
