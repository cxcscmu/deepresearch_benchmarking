### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Apartheid in South Africa was a legally enforced system of racial segregation and discrimination that lasted from 1948 until 1994, affecting all aspects of life for non-white citizens, leading to economic, social, and political repression.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The historical context of apartheid in South Africa began with the election of the National Party in 1948, which implemented a system of racial segregation known as apartheid, meaning 'apartness' in Afrikaans. Under this regime, the rights of the black majority and other non-white populations were severely restricted through various discriminatory laws.

#### Key Legislation:
- **The Population Registration Act (1950)**: Classified citizens by race, fundamentally affecting their rights and access to resources.
- **The Group Areas Act (1950)**: Segregated residential areas, forcing racial groups to live in designated zones, often with undesirable living conditions for blacks.
- **Pass Laws**: Required black South Africans to carry passbooks, severely restricting their movement across the country.
- **The Bantu Education Act (1953)**: Established inferior education for black students, designed to limit their opportunities and reinforce the apartheid system.

#### Social and Economic Impact:
The apartheid regime entrenched economic inequalities, with the majority-black population systematically impoverished and denied opportunities. Under apartheid, non-whites were often relegated to low-wage labor roles, with no rights to join trade unions or strike. The laws significantly affected daily life, stripping black South Africans of basic human dignity and rights, such as political participation, interaction across racial lines, and adequate housing and healthcare.

#### Resistance and International Reaction:
Significant events such as the Sharpeville Massacre (1960), the Soweto Uprising (1976), and the Rivonia Trial (1964) marked crucial points of resistance against apartheid. These events, coupled with growing international opposition, led to cultural boycotts and economic sanctions against South Africa, pressuring the regime.

The process of dismantling apartheid began in the late 1980s, culminating in the 1994 elections that resulted in Nelson Mandela becoming the first black president of South Africa, symbolizing the end of institutionalized racism.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The legacy of apartheid continues to affect South African society today, with ongoing discussions about economic inequalities and social justice in the post-apartheid era. The historical framework set by apartheid still informs many political and social dynamics, highlighting the importance of understanding this context in contemporary South Africa.
