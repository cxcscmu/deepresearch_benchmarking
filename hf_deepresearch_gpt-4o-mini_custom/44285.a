### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The IPCC report indicates that global warming is expected to markedly change rainfall patterns, with global average precipitation increasing while regional changes can vary widely, leading to more extreme weather events like floods and droughts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The latest IPCC reports reveal that the global mean surface temperature has risen by approximately 1.09°C since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900). This rise in temperature significantly affects rainfall patterns globally. Key findings include:
- Every degree of global warming is projected to increase global mean precipitation by about 1% to 3%.
- A warmer climate enhances the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere, thereby intensifying precipitation during wet events.
- The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased, particularly noted in North America, Europe, and Asia. For instance, events that previously occurred once every ten years are now likely to occur 1.3 times in that period at 1.09°C, and could rise to 2.8 occurrences every ten years at a 4°C increase.
- While global average precipitation is projected to increase, the changes in specific regions can vary greatly, with some areas experiencing decreases, while others see increases in average rainfall. These regional variations are strongly linked to changes in atmospheric circulation and weather patterns.
- Notable examples include Southwest Australia, where there is strong agreement among climate models on the expected decrease in rainfall, in contrast to other regions.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The intensified hydrological cycle due to global warming leads not only to increased floods but also drought conditions, affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and water resource management globally. This emphasizes the importance of mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with the anticipated increases in precipitation extremes and variations.
