### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The executive branch in the U.S. has undergone significant evolution since its inception, particularly in terms of its power and authority. Major historical events, presidents, and Supreme Court cases have all played critical roles in expanding, checking, and redefining the power of the presidency.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The executive branch, as established by the U.S. Constitution, was initially designed to have limited power compared to Congress. Over the years, however, presidents have claimed and expanded their authority, particularly during times of crisis:

1. **Early Presidential Influence**: Presidents like Andrew Jackson expanded their powers significantly in the 19th century, notably through strong use of the veto and asserting federal authority during the Nullification Crisis. Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, claiming that the court's authority could not interfere with a president's responsibility to preserve the union.
   
2. **The New Deal Era**: Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (1933-1945) was pivotal, as he introduced the New Deal to address the Great Depression, expanding the role of the federal government in economic and social issues and significantly enhancing executive power.
   
3. **Post-Watergate Checks**: The Watergate scandal in the 1970s caused significant public mistrust in the presidency, resulting in legislation such as the *War Powers Act of 1973*, which aimed to limit the president's ability to engage in military actions without congressional approval. The *Budget and Accounting Act of 1921* and other laws also sought to enhance congressional oversight of the executive branch.
   
4. **Major Supreme Court Cases**:
   - *Marbury v. Madison (1803)*: Established the principle of judicial review, empowering the courts to invalidate laws that contravene the Constitution.
   - *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)*: Limited the president's power to seize private property in the absence of statutory authority, thereby reinforcing checks on executive orders.

5. **Ongoing Evolution**: Throughout history, the executive branch has continued to evolve, particularly during periods of national emergency. Subsequent presidency actions, both asserted and curtailed by legislation and court decisions, highlight the tension between presidential authority and the need for accountability and legislative oversight.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The evolution of the executive branch reflects broader societal and political trends, including shifts in public trust and the balance of power among the branches of government.
