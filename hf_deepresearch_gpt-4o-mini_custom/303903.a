The relationship between art and life encompasses how art influences self-awareness, emotional expression, appreciation, and the quality of life.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Art is an integral aspect of human experience, serving as a medium through which individuals connect with their inner selves and explore their emotional landscapes. It enhances self-awareness, fosters appreciation for life's intricacies, and contributes to overall happiness. In Alex Potts' book, "Allan Kaprow--Art as Life," the author discusses how Kaprow's practice blurred the lines between art and life, emphasizing participation and interaction in artistic endeavors, which reshaped how we perceive art as an everyday occurrence.

Margaret Lazzari and Dona Schlesier's "Exploring Art: A Global, Thematic Approach" reinforces this by promoting a thematic examination of art, bridging historical and cultural contexts and connecting them to personal experiences. The book illustrates that art is not separate from life but is interwoven within it, emphasizing themes that resonate with human experiences such as politics, mortality, and technology.

These works highlight that engaging with art can lead to increased creativity, satisfaction, and emotional connections, ultimately enhancing the quality of life. Through active participation and reflection on art, individuals can better appreciate their surroundings and understand their emotional responses.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Art serves not only as a form of self-expression but as a reflective tool for individuals to navigate their emotional worlds and societal contexts. This relationship underscores the importance of integrating art into daily life, promoting mental well-being and personal growth.
