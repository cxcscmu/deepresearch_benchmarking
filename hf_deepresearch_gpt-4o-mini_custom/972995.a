# Report on the Failure of the League of Nations

## 1. Introduction
The League of Nations was established in 1920 as a response to the devastation of World War I, aiming to promote peace and cooperation among nations. Despite some initial successes, it ultimately failed to maintain international peace and prevent further conflicts, particularly World War II.

## 2. Historical Context
The League was inspired by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's desire for a cohesive international organization aimed at preventing future wars. It comprised a covenant endorsed by 42 founding nations that emphasized collective security and diplomatic negotiation.

## 3. Notable Achievements
- **Aaland Islands (1921):** Resolved a dispute between Sweden and Finland by supporting Finland's claim.
- **Upper Silesia (1921):** Successfully held a referendum to determine the region's affiliation, with both Germany and Poland accepting the League's decision.
- **Memel (1923):** Intervened in Lithuania’s invasion, establishing governance and maintaining the port as an international zone.

## 4. Major Failures
- **Corfu Incident (1923):** Italy invaded Corfu, and the League's failure to hold Italy accountable highlighted its impotence against powerful nations.
- **Invasion of the Ruhr (1923):** The League could not intervene effectively when Belgian and French troops occupied Germany's industrial heartland, undermining its authority.
- **Response to Aggression (1930s):** The League was incapable of taking decisive action during crises such as Japan’s invasion of Manchuria and Italy’s aggression in Ethiopia.
- **Failure to Prevent World War II:** Disarmament efforts and collective security promises proved ineffective as aggressive expansion by nations went unchecked.

## 5. Assessment of Impact
The inability of the League to enforce disarmament and secure international cooperation led to a rise in authoritarian regimes and subsequent global conflict. The lessons learned from this failure informed the structure and approach of the United Nations, which sought to prevent similar mistakes.

## 6. Conclusion
The League of Nations serves as a historical example of the challenges in maintaining international peace through diplomacy alone. Its legacy underscores the need for robust mechanisms and enforcement strategies in global cooperative frameworks.
