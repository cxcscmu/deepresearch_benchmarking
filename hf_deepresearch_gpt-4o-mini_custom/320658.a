### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Euthanasia is the practice of intentionally ending a person's life to alleviate suffering, with various classifications based on consent and action. It can be categorized into types such as active, passive, voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary euthanasia. These classifications raise significant ethical questions regarding patient rights, dignity, and the moral implications of such practices.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Euthanasia, derived from the Greek words "eu" meaning good and "thanatos" meaning death, refers to the act of intentionally ending a person’s life to relieve them of suffering, typically in cases of terminal illness or severe pain. The issue of euthanasia is hotly debated worldwide, encompassing legal, ethical, and moral dimensions.

#### Types of Euthanasia:
1. **Active Euthanasia**: Involves directly causing the death of a patient through means such as administering lethal drugs.
2. **Passive Euthanasia**: Occurs when life-sustaining treatments are withheld or withdrawn, leading to the patient’s death.
3. **Voluntary Euthanasia**: The patient explicitly consents to end their life, typically when suffering from an incurable disease.
4. **Non-voluntary Euthanasia**: The patient is unable to give consent, and another individual decides for them.
5. **Involuntary Euthanasia**: Refers to terminating a person’s life against their will or wishes.

#### Significance in Medical Ethics:
The acceptance of euthanasia provokes complex ethical dilemmas concerning the right to die, autonomy, and the physician's role. The legal frameworks vary globally.

Critics often voice concerns about potential abuses in cases of involuntary euthanasia. Ethical discussions emphasize the importance of informed consent and the respect for individual choices during suffering.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The conversation around euthanasia continues to evolve. Legal regulations are crucial to ensuring patient autonomy while protecting vulnerable individuals against coercion. Understanding these nuances aids in navigating the intricate landscape of medical ethics concerning end-of-life care.
