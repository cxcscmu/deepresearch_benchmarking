### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Children who do not share may develop negative long-term psychological effects, including increased feelings of isolation, difficulty forming relationships, compromised empathy, and challenges in cooperation. Social skills essential for future interactions can be hindered, leading to the potential for ongoing conflict in personal and professional relationships.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The long-term psychological effects of children not sharing can manifest in several key areas:

- **Social Isolation**: Children who consistently refuse to share may find themselves isolated as peers may withdraw from engaging with them. Over time, this isolation can lead to loneliness, impacting their mental well-being and leading to feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness.

- **Lack of Empathy**: Sharing fosters empathy and understanding of others' perspectives. Children who do not share may miss out on developing these important skills, which can result in a lack of compassion and understanding for others in adulthood.

- **Impaired Relationship Skills**: The inability to share can affect the quality and quantity of interpersonal relationships. Such children might struggle with intimacy, trust, and cooperation later in life, making it challenging to foster healthy romantic relationships, friendships, and even collaborations in the workplace.

- **Difficulty with Conflict Resolution**: Sharing involves negotiation and compromise, which are vital skills for resolving disputes effectively. A child who does not learn these skills may adopt maladaptive strategies to handle conflict, leading to increased aggression or avoidance in later interactions.

- **Fear of Abandonment**: Children who do not share may also develop a fear of abandonment, believing that their peers will leave them if they perceive them to be uncooperative or selfish. This can cause anxiety and inhibit their willingness to engage in social situations.

- **Competitive Nature**: When sharing is not practiced, children might develop an excessively competitive attitude, constantly feeling the need to 'win' or 'outdo' others instead of working collaboratively. This can hinder their ability to succeed in teamwork-oriented environments, such as workplaces or community groups.

Overall, the psychological ramifications of not sharing can influence a child's emotional intelligence and social adaptability throughout their life.

### 3. Additional Context on the document and question asked:
The provided document discusses a study on children's natural tendencies to share when they engage in cooperative activities. It underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in fostering a sense of fairness and equality among children. The study shows that children, even at a young age, have an inherent inclination to share when they work together toward a common goal, contrasting with behaviors typically seen when they are solely focused on their interests.

The insights gleaned from this study highlight a critical aspect of child development: the contexts in which children share can significantly influence their social behaviors and future psychological outcomes. If children are consistently placed in environments that encourage sharing and cooperation, they are less likely to face the negative long-term effects associated with refusal to share. Thus, caregivers, parents, and educators play a crucial role in modeling and teaching the value of sharing and collaboration, shaping healthier future interactions in children's lives.
