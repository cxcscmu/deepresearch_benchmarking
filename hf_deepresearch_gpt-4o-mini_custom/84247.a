### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Legal definitions of freedom of speech vary globally, generally protecting speech in democratic nations while imposing stricter regulations in authoritarian contexts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Freedom of speech legally embodies the right to express opinions without censorship or restraint. However, the interpretations and protections vary by country:

- **United States**: The First Amendment guarantees robust protection, allowing controversial ideas but excluding incitement to violence and hate speech.
- **Canada**: The Charter protects freedom of expression with reasonable limits concerning hate speech and obscenity.
- **United Kingdom**: Freedom of speech is protected under the Human Rights Act, with limitations on defamation and inciting racial hatred.
- **Germany**: Constitutional rights exist, but strict laws prevent hate speech and Nazi propaganda.
- **Australia**: No explicit constitutional protection; however, political communication is impliedly free within certain legal boundaries.
- **China**: Limited freedom; the government exercises strict censorship over dissent and media.
- **India**: Article 19 protects speech but includes restrictions for incitement and disorder.
- **Brazil**: The Constitution allows freedom of speech with restrictions against hate speech.
- **Russia**: Theoretically free, but practical suppression of dissent and media occurs.

Each of these examples illustrates the complex balance between protecting individual expression and maintaining public order.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The analysis shows that legal definitions of freedom of speech are shaped by social, political, and historical factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive examination of existing laws to understand global expression and censorship practices.
