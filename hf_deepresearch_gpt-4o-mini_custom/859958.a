### 1. Task outcome (short version):
- Examples of agencies that facilitate international trade include the International Trade Administration (ITA), World Trade Organization (WTO), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and other organizations focused on reducing trade barriers and improving customs processes.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **International Trade Administration (ITA)**: This U.S. agency promotes exports of nonagricultural U.S. services and goods. It is part of the Department of Commerce and provides diplomatic support, facilitates market selection, ensures access to international markets, and safeguards against unfair competition. The ITA's budget was approximately $497 million in 2015.

- **World Trade Organization (WTO)**: The WTO establishes global trade agreements like the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which aims to simplify and speed up customs procedures among member countries. Ratified by 112 countries in 2017, the TFA is expected to boost global trade by reducing costs associated with international transactions.

- **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)**: The ICC plays a crucial role in customs and trade facilitation, advocating for the reduction of burdensome customs requirements. Their work targets streamlining processes that disproportionately affect smaller and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

- **Forum for International Trade Training (FITT)**: FITT develops global competency standards for trade professionals, ensuring that professionals are adequately trained and that international trade education remains relevant and effective.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
- Trade facilitation initiatives can significantly increase global trade, with experts suggesting a potential boost of up to $1 trillion annually through improved border processes. Organizations working on trade facilitation not only help reduce tariffs but also improve other customs-related barriers, which often harm developing countries and SMEs most severely.
