## Report on Free Will: Real or Illusion?

### 1. Philosophical Perspectives on Free Will
The investigation into philosophical perspectives on free will reveals a rich and ongoing discourse, with key contributions from historical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. Contemporary debates challenge or defend the notion of free will against determinism.

**Historical Contributions:**
- **Plato:** Free will viewed as aligning with the understanding of the Good, emphasizing self-mastery.
- **Aristotle:** Focused on voluntary nature and character, questioning determination by prior actions or external influences.
- **Epicureans and Stoics:** Introducing ideas of causation and choice, with Stoics positing determinism yet advocating for personal agency.
- **Augustine:** Merging theology and free will, presenting debates on compatibilism vs libertarianism.
- **Aquinas:** Reconciling Aristotleâ€™s views with theology, suggesting rational will towards good while retaining freedom of choice.

**Contemporary Discussants:**
Modern discussions often engage with insights from neuroscience and psychology, questioning traditional autonomy notions. Thinkers like Carlo Filice highlight emerging skepticism around pure autonomy due to neurological findings.

### 2. Scientific Findings on Free Will
Research shows a complex interplay between free will and decision-making influenced by psychology and neuroscience:

**Neuroscience Perspectives:**
- Research has discovered brain activation precedes conscious decisions, implying decisions may be initiated unconsciously.
- The readiness potential observed in EEG studies indicates brain commitments before conscious intentions, supporting deterministic views.
- However, many argue that neuroscience does not nullify free will, demonstrating interactions where brain activity informs conscious decision-making without dictating it.

**Psychological Perspectives:**
- Emphasizes self-determination, with various theories asserting individuals make choices independent of constraints.
- Humanistic psychologists advocate for inherent free will in shaping destinies.
- The discourse highlights the balance between psychological and biological factors influencing decisions, upholding the presence of free will amidst deterministic notions.

### 3. Conclusion
Ongoing philosophical and scientific debates regarding free will not only impact theoretical discussions but also illuminate the implications for ethics, law, and personal responsibility.
