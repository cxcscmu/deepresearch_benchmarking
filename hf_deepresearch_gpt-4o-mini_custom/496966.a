### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Macbeth is a quintessential tragic hero, whose ambition leads him to moral corruption and ultimately to his downfall.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In William Shakespeare’s "Macbeth," the protagonist embodies the archetype of a tragic hero. According to Aristotle’s definition, a tragic hero is a character of noble birth with heroic qualities who ultimately faces downfall due to a tragic flaw (hamartia). Initially portrayed as a loyal and valiant soldier, Macbeth’s character deteriorates after he encounters the prophecies of the three witches, which awaken his latent ambition.

Macbeth’s tragic flaw is his unchecked ambition, compounded by external influences, particularly from Lady Macbeth and the prophecies. He reaches a turning point when he contemplates murdering King Duncan to fulfill his ambition. In Act 1, Scene 7, he reflects, "I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other." This acknowledges his ambition but also foreshadows his inevitable failure and destruction.

After committing regicide, Macbeth descends further into moral chaos and paranoia, illustrated when he states, "Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine, making the green one red" (Act 2, Scene 2). This quote highlights his overwhelming guilt and the consequences of his actions, representing his tragic realization and internal conflict.

Furthermore, Macbeth's pride and refusal to heed warnings lead to his alienation from those who previously supported him, marking his fall from grace. His leadership spirals into tyranny, and he becomes increasingly isolated from reality. The audience witnesses his mental decline, culminating in the tragic ending where he is ultimately defeated and killed, confirming his tragic status.

The themes of ambition, morality, and the human condition are personified in Macbeth, showcasing how unchecked desires can lead to both personal and societal ruin. His journey tragically illustrates that greatness is often coupled with corruption, a central idea in Shakespeare’s portrayal of human ambition.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Macbeth’s tragic story serves as a timeless cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and moral compromise, encouraging reflections on human nature and the costs of desiring power without consideration of ethical boundaries.
