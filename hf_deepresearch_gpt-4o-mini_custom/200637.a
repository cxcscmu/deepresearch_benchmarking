### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change is significantly impacting bird populations worldwide. Key observations include altered nesting times, migration patterns, and potential risks to species survival.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change has profound effects on birds, which are crucial indicators of ecological health. Research indicates that global temperature increases are directly impacting bird physiology and behavior:
- **Nesting and Breeding**: Birds are laying eggs earlier in the season, with studies indicating an average advance of 6.6 days per decade in egg-laying times. For instance, the Common Murre has shifted its breeding dates 24 days forward every decade. Tree Swallows are now nesting up to 9 days earlier compared to the last 30 years, correlating with rising spring temperatures.
- **Migration Patterns**: Migration timings have also shifted, with many species arriving earlier each year. A study spanning 63 years revealed that 27 out of 96 migrant species in Canada are now arriving significantly earlier than before, aligned with warming trends.
- **Behavioral Changes**: Birds may undergo physical changes ('shapeshifting') such as developing larger beaks and limbs, enabling them to better regulate body temperature. These adaptations are seen as potential responses to increased thermal stress.
- **Population Risks**: The long-term impacts of these changes raise concerns for bird species, many of which are facing extinction risks due to climate change. Current predictions suggest that climate change will exacerbate challenges faced by numerous species, pushing them toward habitat and resource shortages.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Birds play vital ecological roles, including pest control and seed dispersal, making their survival crucial not only for biodiversity but also for human wellbeing. The insights gathered underscore the importance of conservation efforts, particularly as global temperatures continue to rise.
