### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The failure of the Reconstruction era (1865-1877) can be attributed to a combination of political, social, and economic factors, including the lack of sustained political will, the implementation of discriminatory laws such as Jim Crow and black codes, public sentiment against integration, and the ultimate withdrawal of federal support following the Hayes Compromise.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Reconstruction era aimed to rebuild the United States after the Civil War, primarily focused on addressing the rights of newly freed African Americans and re-integrating the Southern states into the Union. However, this period is often characterized as a failure due to several interconnected reasons:

1. **Lack of Political Will**: Both the Johnson and Grant administrations failed to enforce civil rights for African Americans. Their inability to unify the political landscape and prioritize civil rights legislation weakened Reconstruction efforts.

2. **Jim Crow Laws and Black Codes**: The emergence of Jim Crow laws established racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans, undermining the very purpose of Reconstruction. Black codes were put in place that restricted freedoms and perpetuated unequal treatment akin to slavery.

3. **Public Sentiment and Division**: The North's interventions were often viewed as patronizing by Southern citizens, leading to further resentment. The stark division between Northern and Southern attitudes towards race and integration contributed significantly to the failure of Reconstruction.

4. **Economic Challenges**: The South was economically devastated post-Civil War, with labor systems that were not adapted for the newly freed population. Economic hardships hindered the execution of Reconstruction policies that required prosperous Southern states to thrive.

5. **Hayes Compromise of 1877**: The end of Reconstruction was signaled by this compromise, which led to the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, effectively ending any support for the civil rights of African Americans and allowing white supremacist groups to rise in power.

These factors collectively created an environment in which the goals of Reconstruction could not be achieved, leading to a reestablishment of white supremacy in the South and a long-lasting legacy of racial inequality.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The historiography of the Reconstruction era has evolved, with various scholars debating its success and failures. While some point out achievements in civil rights and legislation, the overwhelming consensus remains that the systemic issues rooted in the social and political frameworks of the time ultimately led to its downfall.
