## Report on the Ethics of Capital Punishment

### 1. Legal Status and Execution Statistics
- **Global Perspectives**: Capital punishment is enforced in 56 countries, with diverse methods of execution including lethal injection, hanging, and firing squads. Countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia maintain strict practices, while many others are moving towards abolition.
- **Execution Rates**:
  - In 2022, there were three documented executions in the U.S. (two in Oklahoma, one in Alabama).
  - Execution rates have significantly declined from 85 executions in 2000 to just 17 in 2020. This indicates a notable trend against capital punishment in recent decades.

### 2. Ethical Theories
- **Utilitarianism**: This perspective argues that capital punishment can only be justified if it leads to greater societal good. However, wrongful convictions challenge this view, indicating a potential for unnecessary harm.
- **Deontology**: Emphasizes moral duty over consequences, arguing against capital punishment based on the inviolable right to life.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Focuses on the moral character implications; advocates for alternatives to punishment that promote rehabilitation over retribution.

### 3. Public Opinion Trends
- According to recent surveys, public support for capital punishment remains under 60%. The 2021 Gallup poll showed that only 54% favored the death penalty, a significant decline from over 80% in the mid-1990s.
- Growing awareness of wrongful convictions and moral opposition plays a role in changing attitudes, with many states considering moratoriums or abolition of the death penalty.

### 4. Discussion
The ethical implications of capital punishment are complex, shaped by legal, philosophical, and social dimensions. While previously supported as a deterrent and a means of justice, the increasing recognition of wrongful convictions and shifting public sentiments suggest that many are reevaluating its moral legitimacy.

### Conclusion
Evaluating the ethics of capital punishment involves examining not only its legal frameworks and execution statistics but also the foundational ethical beliefs that inform public opinion. The increasing opposition to capital punishment across various fronts brings into question whether it can still be justified in modern society.

In the end, one's stance on the ethics of capital punishment may depend heavily on personal philosophical beliefs, societal values, and emerging evidence regarding its implications for justice and morality.
