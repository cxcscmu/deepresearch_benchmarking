### Report: Should a Database of People Paroled or Released for Crimes Be Made Public?

#### 1. Introduction
The debate over whether to make parole records publicly accessible involves crucial considerations of transparency, individual privacy, and community safety. As societies grapple with rehabilitating offenders while ensuring public safety, understanding the implications of open access to parole records is essential.

#### 2. Current Laws
Laws governing public access to parole records exhibit considerable variance across states:
- **Georgia**: Public records are generally available unless specified otherwise, with many parole records classified as confidential.
- **Virginia**: Certain aspects of the parole board's activities are transparent, but specific individual records often remain exempt from disclosure.
- **Oklahoma**: The Open Records Act allows access to most government records but exceptions apply depending on the type of information requested.
- **California & Illinois**: Broad access provisions exist, allowing the public to request certain parole records while maintaining confidential information.

#### 3. Public Opinion & Ethical Considerations
The ethical landscape surrounding public access to parole records reveals the tension between the need for community safety and the rights to privacy of individuals. While transparency serves accountability, public access may lead to stigmatization, potentially making reintegration into society more challenging for parolees and increasing the likelihood of recidivism.

#### 4. Effects on Community Safety & Recidivism
Research indicates mixed outcomes regarding public access to parole records. Increased transparency is theoretically linked to greater accountability, yet there's concern that it might exacerbate social ostracism for parolees, with empirical studies showing public access might not yield substantive benefits concerning recidivism rates.

#### 5. Case Studies
Narratives from subjects in documentaries such as 'The Interview' illustrate personal challenges faced by former prisoners during their reintegration journeys, shedding light on how public access can both hinder and facilitate recovery. Reports, such as the OPD's Parole Project Report, highlight systemic issues and advocate for reform in policies governing public access to ensure effective rehabilitation.

#### 6. Recommendations
To strike a balance between public safety and individual privacy, policymakers should consider:
- Implementing guidelines that restrict access to sensitive information while allowing transparency about conditions and compliance.
- Establishing community support programs that help mitigate stigma and offer reintegration assistance.
- Promoting public education initiatives about the realities of parole to foster understanding and reduce misconceptions.

#### 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, while public access to parole records enhances certain aspects of transparency and accountability essential for community safety, it also poses significant challenges to individual privacy and successful reintegration. A carefully balanced approach is necessary to ensure that both community safety interests and individual rights of the parolees are safeguarded.
