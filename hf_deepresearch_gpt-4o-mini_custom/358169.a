### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Stone Age timeline is divided into three main periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic was characterized by hunter-gatherer societies, tool-making, and cave art. The Mesolithic marked a transition with the development of semi-permanent settlements and preliminary agriculture, while the Neolithic introduced full agricultural practices, settled communities, and advancements in pottery and tool-making.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
#### Paleolithic Period (c. 2.6 million years ago - c. 10,000 BCE)
- **Characteristics:** 
  - The earliest era of human history, marked by the use of stone tools and a nomadic lifestyle centered around hunting and gathering.
  - Tools included hand axes and cutting implements made from stone, wood, bone, and antlers.
  - Fire was mastered during this period, which greatly aided in survival, cooking, and protection.
  - Art emerged in the form of cave paintings, carvings, and early musical instruments like bone flutes.
  - Social structures were likely small groups or bands, relying heavily on cooperation for hunting.

#### Mesolithic Period (c. 10,000 BCE - c. 8,000 BCE)
- **Characteristics:** 
  - This transitional period is characterized by the end of the last Ice Age, leading to changes in climate and habitat.
  - Development of microlithsâ€”small flint blades that were used in tools and weapons, indicating an evolution in technology.
  - Some communities started forming semi-permanent settlements as they began to exploit local resources more intensively.
  - Important innovations included the use of bows and arrows, as well as fishing tools, contributing to varied diets.
  - Cultural practices began to change, incorporating ritualistic elements seen in burials and art.

#### Neolithic Period (c. 10,000 BCE - c. 4,500 BCE)
- **Characteristics:** 
  - Marked by the introduction of agriculture, where communities transitioned from foraging to farming, cultivating plants and domesticating animals.
  - This period saw the establishment of permanent settlements and the development of complex societies, with advancements in pottery, weaving, and architecture.
  - Major innovations included the transition to polished stone tools, advancing construction techniques, and enhanced artistic expression through pottery and monumental structures.
  - Social structures became more complex, leading to the emergence of trade networks and wealth differentiation within communities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic marked a significant change not only in human technology and social organization but also in the way humans interacted with their environment. The establishment of agriculture allowed for population growth and the development of civilizations, setting the stage for future advancements in human history.
