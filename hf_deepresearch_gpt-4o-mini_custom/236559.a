### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Abortion significantly impacts women's health and society, with approximately 73 million induced abortions occurring annually worldwide, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Guttmacher Institute provides detailed insights into abortion statistics in the United States, highlighting both health outcomes and societal effects.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
According to the **World Health Organization** (WHO):
- Approximately **73 million** induced abortions occur worldwide each year. 
- About **61%** of all unintended pregnancies and **29%** of all pregnancies in general end in an abortion.
- Tracking abortion rates varies across countries, especially in regions where abortion is illegal, leading to underreporting.
- A notable insight from WHO's studies indicates that women who abort face significantly *higher suicide rates* compared to those who carry to term, with studies showing rates nearly six times greater in countries like Sweden.

From the **Guttmacher Institute**:
- In the United States, an estimated **862,320** abortions occurred in 2017, based on their research. 
- The Guttmacher Institute, along with the CDC, is a primary source for U.S. abortion data, though it must be noted that reporting can be inconsistent across states.
- Factors such as *abortion access laws* have been shown to correlate with womenâ€™s health outcomes, indicating that restrictive policies can lead to poorer health outcomes among women.

The societal impacts of abortion are also profound:  
- Abortion affects not only individuals but the community as a whole, leading to long-term psychological, moral, and financial consequences within society. 
- Strains on community health systems can arise from both the legal and illegal practice of abortion, impacting available healthcare resources and public perception on reproductive health.
- It has been suggested that abortion restrictions may disproportionally affect marginalized populations, leading to wider societal inequities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
- Studies examining the effects of abortion on mental health report troubling statistics regarding increased rates of anxiety and depression among women post-abortion as compared to those who carry to term. 
- Ongoing debates about abortion often reflect a broader conflict surrounding reproductive rights, access to healthcare, and societal values, which can influence public policy and individual lives.
