### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The environmental impacts of manufacturing processes include significant energy consumption, resource depletion, and waste generation. Various sustainability metrics and standards exist to assess and mitigate these impacts, with proven case studies demonstrating successful sustainable practices across industries.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Manufacturing processes are key contributors to environmental degradation through excessive energy use, emissions, and water consumption. Key environmental impacts can be classified as:

- **Resource Consumption**: Manufacturing often requires large amounts of raw materials and energy, contributing to resource depletion and loss of biodiversity.
- **Waste Generation**: Traditional manufacturing generates substantial waste, which can contribute to landfills, air pollution, and water resource pollution.
- **Emissions of Pollutants**: Manufacturing processes frequently emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants, increasing air pollution and climate change risks.

To address these impacts, manufacturers can implement sustainable practices, which include:
- **Green Manufacturing**: This approach emphasizes using sustainable resources, reducing waste, and minimizing emissions throughout the product lifecycle.
- **Lifecycle Assessment (LCA)**: This methodology assesses environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life to identify opportunities for improvements and resource savings.
- **Metrics**: Key metrics such as water usage (m³), energy consumption (kWh), carbon footprint (CO₂ equivalent), and waste generated (kg) help organizations measure and analyze their impact. Standards such as ISO 14001 provide frameworks for establishing an effective environmental management system.

**Case Studies**:
- The Advanced Composite Structures company used Lean Manufacturing principles to streamline its production process, resulting in a reduction of production costs by 65% and an increase in output.
- Various organizations have adopted frameworks like those from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to promote responsible resource management and minimize their environmental footprints.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Sustainability standards such as those provided by ISO and various industry certifications are crucial for guiding businesses toward more sustainable practices. These standards help ensure compliance with environmental regulations, improve operational efficiency, and enhance market competitiveness.
