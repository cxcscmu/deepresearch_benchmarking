### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Major forms of resistance to slavery include active and passive methods such as rebellions, running away, cultural preservation, and everyday resistance techniques. Notable events include Nat Turnerâ€™s Rebellion and the Underground Railroad led by Harriet Tubman. Significant context surrounds the numerous uprisings throughout U.S. history, including lesser-known revolts that contributed to the abolition movement.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Enslaved African Americans employed various forms of resistance against slavery, ranging from violent uprisings to subtle, day-to-day acts of defiance. Key forms of resistance include:

1. **Active Resistance:** 
   - **Nat Turner's Rebellion (1831):** This infamous rebellion led by Nat Turner in Virginia resulted in the deaths of approximately 60 white individuals and a severe retaliatory crackdown on the enslaved population.
   - **Stono Rebellion (1739):** One of the largest slave uprisings in the colonial era, where slaves revolted in South Carolina, resulting in a significant violent confrontation with militiamen.
   - **Lesser-Known Rebellions:** Several other uprisings, such as the 1712 New York City insurrection, where slaves killed multiple colonists, were pivotal in awakening public sentiments against slavery, despite their brutal suppression.

2. **Passive Resistance:** 
   - **Everyday Resistance Techniques:** Enslaved people engaged in slower work, feigned illness, broke tools, and even sabotaged agricultural equipment as forms of resisting their status.
   - **Underground Railroad:** Led by figures like Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad was a covert network that facilitated the escape of over 300 slaves to freedom. Tubman, known for her bravery and strategic planning, made numerous trips to bring slaves to safety without losing a passenger.

3. **Cultural Preservation:** Enslaved people retained elements of their African heritage through music, spirituality, and community gatherings, which served as a form of subtle defiance against their oppressors.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
- It is estimated that there were over 250 documented slave rebellions in America before 1865. The impact of these rebellions not only shaped public opinion about slavery but also instigated fear among slaveholders, leading to stricter controls over enslaved populations. The legacy of resistance movements is seen in the cultural memory of African Americans and continues to inspire civil rights movements today.
