### How Humans Are Causing Climate Change: A Structured Report

#### 1. Overview
Human activities are overwhelmingly responsible for global warming, with the latest IPCC report confirming that nearly 100% of the observed temperature increase since the late 19th century is due to anthropogenic factors.

#### 2. Key Human Activities Contributing to Climate Change
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy, transportation, and industry is the primary source of greenhouse gases. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to a warming effect.
  
- **Deforestation**: The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urban development reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 from the air, thus increasing atmospheric carbon levels.

- **Agricultural Practices**: Livestock production generates significant methane emissions, while certain agricultural practices release nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas.

- **Industrial Processes**: Many industries release greenhouse gases through production processes and byproducts.

#### 3. Impacts of Climate Change
- **Temperature Rise**: The Earth's average temperature has increased by approximately 1.09 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, with about 1.07 degrees of this warming due to human activities.
  
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Increased human influence has led to more frequent and severe weather events, such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and droughts.

#### 4. Urgency for Action
The IPCC report emphasizes that drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are essential to prevent catastrophic climate outcomes. The world is on track for an estimated 2.7Â°C increase in temperature by 2100 unless immediate action is taken.

#### 5. Future Goals
- Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is critical to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.
- Immediate action is necessary, and even with such efforts, some warming is now unavoidable.

### Conclusion
The scientific consensus is clear: human activities are the primary drivers of climate change, necessitating urgent collective action to reduce emissions and slow the progress of global warming.
