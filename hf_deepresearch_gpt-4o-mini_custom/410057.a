### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The latest statistics on modern slavery from the Global Slavery Index indicate that the most recent comprehensive data available is from 2018, with no updated editions released for years 2021, 2022, or 2023. 

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Global Slavery Index (GSI) is a significant study on modern slavery published by the Minderoo Foundation's Walk Free initiative, and the most recent edition was published in 2018. According to the 2018 GSI, around 40.3 million people were estimated to be living in modern slavery globally, with a prevalence rate of 5.4 per 1,000 population. Specific statistics from the 2018 report include:
- **Philippines**: 784,000 individuals (7.70/1000)
- **Saudi Arabia**: 61,000 individuals (1.93/1000)
- **Mauritania**: 90,000 individuals (21.43/1000)

However, the search for updated data specific to 2021, 2022, or 2023 produced no recent statistics or reports from the Global Slavery Index, indicating a gap in data availability beyond 2018. 

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Given that the Global Slavery Index hasn't published an update since 2018, organizations and policymakers may rely on this data for understanding trends in modern slavery, but awareness should be raised about the need for more current statistics to reflect the complex and changing nature of human trafficking and forced labor in recent years.
