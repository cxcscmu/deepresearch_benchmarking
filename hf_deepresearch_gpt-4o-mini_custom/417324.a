### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current research indicates that excessive screen time in teenagers is linked to various psychological, physical, and social issues, with recommendations suggesting limited usage for healthier outcomes.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Recent studies have shown that teenagers are spending more than 7 hours a day on screens for entertainment purposes, a statistic that has risen substantially—during the COVID-19 pandemic, this number reportedly increased to an average of 7.7 hours. Excessive screen time has been associated with a variety of negative impacts:

- **Psychological Impacts:** Increased instances of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and attention difficulties, particularly associated with insufficient sleep due to screen use. Behaviors underlined by ADHD have been linked to high screen time and violent or fast-paced content consumption.
- **Physical Impacts:** Studies show a correlation between excessive screen time and health issues such as obesity, poor sleep quality, impaired vision, and cardiovascular risks. Prolonged screen use can also lead to decreased physical activity levels.
- **Social Impacts:** Adolescents may experience a decline in their social skills, where addictive screen use interferes with real-life interactions and coping mechanisms.

Not all screen time is equal; quality matters significantly. For example, screen time spent on educational activities can be less impactful compared to gaming or social media consumption. 

Organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that parents set consistent limits on screen time to ensure that it does not interfere with essential activities such as sleep, physical health, and familial engagement. They suggest that screen time, especially for entertainment, should be monitored, and productive usage encouraged—such as using screens for school projects or art.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Parents are urged to be engaged with their children's media consumption, setting an example and discussing the content with them. Limiting screen time and ensuring that it does not replace essential daily activities can foster healthier habits in teenagers.
