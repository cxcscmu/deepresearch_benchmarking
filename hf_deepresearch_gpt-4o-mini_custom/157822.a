### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Canada became involved in World War II by declaring war on Germany on September 10, 1939, eight days after Britain and France did so following Germany's invasion of Poland. Canadians were strongly supportive of this decision, largely due to past ties to Britain, and the declaration reflected Canada's growing autonomy as a nation.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Canada's involvement in World War II began shortly after the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. On **September 1, 1939**, Germany invaded Poland, prompting Britain and France to issue an ultimatum to Germany for its withdrawal. The British declared war on **September 3, 1939**, and after nearly a week of debates in Parliament, Canada followed suit by formally declaring war on Germany on **September 10, 1939**.

The decision to declare war was characterized by a nearly unanimous vote in the Canadian Parliament, reflecting the public's support despite some wariness stemming from the trauma of World War I. Prime Minister *William Lyon Mackenzie King* delivered the proclamation over the radio, marking a significant moment of Canada’s legislative and diplomatic independence as, unlike in WWI, it was not required to wait for the British Government’s announcement.

Initially, to minimize casualties and the potential for conscription, Canada planned a limited war effort involving supplying materials and training aircrews rather than committing infantry units. Nevertheless, Canada began to scale up its military contributions rapidly over the following years. One significant initiative was the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, launched in Canada to train aircrews away from the immediate dangers of conflict in Britain.

As the war progressed, the involvement of Canadian forces expanded significantly, with major contributions in various campaigns including the **Dieppe Raid** on **August 19, 1942**, which resulted in heavy casualties for Canadian troops, and participation in the **Italian Campaign**, commencing with the invasion of Sicily on **July 10, 1943**. By war's end, approximately 1.1 million Canadians had served in the military, with around 45,300 losing their lives.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Public sentiment towards the war was shaped by the feelings of obligation to support Britain and the fear of fascism. Propaganda was extensively used to maintain public morale and ensure enlistment, as the Canadian government sought to foster a strong sense of national and military pride. Women also played an essential role, taking on various support roles within the military and workforce to keep the economy and military operations functioning during the war.
