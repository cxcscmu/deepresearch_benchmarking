### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The statistics on gun violence rates before and after gun bans indicate mixed results, showing reductions in some areas while also revealing complex trends, such as increased percentages of gun-related violence post-ban in specific regions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
A thorough review of various studies and statistics presents a nuanced picture of gun violence in relation to gun bans:

1. **Australia's Gun Ban** (Post-Port Arthur Massacre, 1996): Immediately following the buyback program, there was a notable increase in public perception of violence, yet data indicated a significant reduction in homicide rates by roughly 9% in the year following the ban according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. However, this does not dismiss claims of initial spikes in certain types of violent crimes.

2. **United States Trends (1993-2013)**: According to data from the Centers for Disease Control, firearm-related homicides declined from 7 per 100,000 individuals in 1993 to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2013. This contrasts sharply with claims suggesting increasing gun violence; hence the narrative of more guns equating to less violence has been propagated by some analysts, particularly in the American Enterprise Institute.

3. **Chicago Experience**: Following the handgun ban in Chicago in the early 1980s, while there was a decline in the overall murder rate, the percentage of homicides committed with handguns increased from 48% to 59%, highlighting the complexity surrounding illegal access to firearms.

4. **Harvard Study**: Research published in the Harvard Journal of Law indicates that increased gun ownership may correlate with lower crime rates, reinforcing the idea that merely implementing gun bans does not straightforwardly translate to reduced violence.

5. **Gun Violence Statistics by State**: Data compilation reveals that the U.S. had the 19th highest firearm homicide rate globally in 2012, and recent figures indicate ongoing challenges with gun-related violence across various states. The variation illustrates that while some regions experience reductions in homicides after bans, others see an increase.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The debate surrounding gun violence and gun bans remains deeply polarized. While empirical data provides insights into trends, the socio-political context influences public perception and policy. Comprehensive studies are necessary to unpack the long-term effects of gun restrictions, as many factors contribute to gun violence beyond simple legislative changes.
