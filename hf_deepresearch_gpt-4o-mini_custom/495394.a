### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Charles Dickens’ portrayal of poverty in his works, particularly in 'A Christmas Carol' and 'Oliver Twist', reveals the severe social injustices of Victorian England, emphasizing the struggles of the impoverished while critiquing societal norms and institutions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Charles Dickens, through his literary works, provides a poignant commentary on poverty, especially as depicted in 'A Christmas Carol' and 'Oliver Twist'. In 'A Christmas Carol', he illustrates the stark contrasts between the wealthy and the poor in Victorian society, using characters like Ebenezer Scrooge and the Cratchit family to highlight the struggles faced by the poor. For instance, Scrooge's disdain for the poor reflects a common attitude of the time, which is challenged throughout the novella as he learns about the hardships faced by families like the Cratchits. Dickens presents the Cratchit family's meager Christmas dinner as a symbol of their struggles, poignantly illustrating the theme of poverty.

In 'Oliver Twist', Dickens similarly critiques the social structures that fail the vulnerable. He portrays Oliver as an innocent victim of the very systems designed to help the poor, such as the workhouse, which instead perpetuates suffering and injustice. Dickens uses the stories of various characters to dissect the moral failings of society and the lack of empathy toward the poor.

Overall, Dickens’ works serve both as a critique of Victorian social attitudes and a call to action, urging society to extend compassion and support to those in need.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Dickens' own experiences of poverty as a child inform his writing. Having worked in a boot blacking factory at a young age due to his family's financial struggles, he reveals a deep empathy for the working class and the systemic issues they face. His critique of the New Poor Law, which he deemed inadequate and punitive, further underscores his advocacy for social reform. Through rich storytelling, Dickens not only entertains but also educates his readers on the pressing social issues of his time, making his works timelessly relevant.
