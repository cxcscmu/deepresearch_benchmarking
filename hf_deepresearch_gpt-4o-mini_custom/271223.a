Final Report: Should Underaged Children Be Allowed to Own Social Media Accounts? 

### 1. Legal Considerations
- Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat generally require users to be at least 13 years old. Some platforms, such as WhatsApp, have raised the age limit to 16 based on local regulations, particularly recent EU data protection laws. 
- Age restrictions exist to shield underage users from harmful content and risks such as cyberbullying.

### 2. Current Usage Statistics
- Approximately 50% of children by age 12 have social media accounts. A significant 78% of children aged 10-12 use social media despite these age restrictions.
- The over-usage of social media has led to children averaging between 6.6 to 8.4 social media accounts, raising concerns about their exposure and engagement patterns on these platforms.

### 3. Psychological and Behavioral Impacts
- Research reveals a correlation between social media use and adverse mental health outcomes in children, including heightened anxiety, depression, and issues related to self-esteem.
- Social media can exacerbate mental health issues, especially during critical developmental stages. During the pandemic, the reliance on online connection increased, while the risks of addiction and dependency on social media platforms became more pronounced.

### 4. Enforcement of Age Restrictions
- Social media platforms implement various age verification methods, including asking for birth dates and using AI to detect underage accounts, yet these measures are frequently circumvented by children who provide false information.
- There are significant challenges in effectively enforcing age restrictions, making it easy for minors to bypass safeguards intended to protect them.

### 5. Recommendations
- While social media can facilitate connections, especially in isolating situations, it is crucial for parents and guardians to actively monitor and guide children's usage.
- Education on the safety and risks of social media, along with implementing parental controls, can play an essential role in fostering a healthier online environment for younger users.
- Continuous research and development of more reliable age verification processes are necessary to improve the protection of underage users on social media platforms.

### 6. Conclusion
Given the current evidence and concerns regarding vulnerability to mental health issues, cyberbullying, and the inadequate enforcement of age restrictions, it may be prudent to reconsider allowing underaged children unrestricted access to social media. Recommendations for best practices include parental guidance, appropriate monitoring, and an active dialogue about safe online behaviors.
