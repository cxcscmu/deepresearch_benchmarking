### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current statistics on gun use for self-defense indicate varying estimates, ranging from approximately 500,000 to 3 million uses annually in the U.S., with a notable study suggesting 67,740 instances recorded by the FBI.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In analyzing gun use for self-defense, multiple studies present varying statistics. The FBI reports that firearms are used in self-defense approximately 67,740 times per year. However, major studies have found that Americans defensively use firearms between 500,000 to over 3 million times annually. According to research supported by the CDC, defensive gun use may prevent up to 400,000 life-threatening violent crimes each year, with a significant percentage of convicted felons indicating they avoided committing crimes when they were aware that victims might be armed. Despite these figures, a Harvard analysis suggested that defensive gun use is less common than suggested, highlighting the complexity of these statistics. Furthermore, concerns persist regarding the overall safety associated with gun ownership, as its prevalence can correlate with increased risks of gun-related homicides and suicides.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
These statistics are largely drawn from various surveys and analyses, leading to ongoing debates regarding the effectiveness of guns in self-defense situations. Discrepancies in estimates may arise from methodological differences in studies, raising questions about the actual rates of defensive gun use in contrast to reported incidents. Moreover, the implications of gun ownership on public safety remain a contentious issue, influencing discussions around policy and legislation.
