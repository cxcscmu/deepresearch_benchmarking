### Reasons Single Individuals May Face Higher Tax Burdens:

1. **Standard Deductions:**
   - For the tax year 2023, single filers have a standard deduction of **$13,850**, while married couples filing jointly benefit from a standard deduction of **$27,700**. The larger standard deduction for married filers significantly reduces their taxable income relative to single filers.

2. **Tax Credits and Benefits:**
   - Married filers generally qualify for larger and more beneficial credits. For instance, both single and married filers can claim the **Child Tax Credit**, but married couples often have higher income thresholds for credit eligibility, maximizing their potential tax benefits.

3. **Unit of Tax Systems:**
   - The tax filing status can create disparities in effective tax rates. Taxes typically skew towards higher aggregate income when filing as married, allowing two incomes to balance and potentially lower their effective total tax rate compared to a single income.

4. **Additional Deductions for Dependents:**
   - Married couples with children often have access to additional deductions and credits, lowering their overall tax liability. This includes tax breaks associated with childcare, education, and medical expenses, while single filers may not have the same opportunities if they have no dependents.

5. **Phase-Out Thresholds:**
   - The income phase-out thresholds for credits like the **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** are generally more favorable for married couples, allowing them to access a higher credit value than single filers at similar income levels.

Overall, while the U.S. tax system operates on a progressive structure, the benefits via deductions and credits favor married couples and can lead to significant differences in tax liability compared to single individuals. This creates a structure where single filers often bear a heavier tax burden relative to their married counterparts.
