### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Vaccine efficacy measures how well a vaccine works in controlled clinical trials, with a minimum requirement of 50% efficacy for WHO-approved vaccines. It reflects the percentage reduction in disease among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in the trial setting.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percentage reduction in disease incidence among vaccinated individuals compared to those who are unvaccinated, as determined in controlled clinical trials. For instance, if a vaccine has an efficacy rate of 70%, it means that vaccinated individuals are approximately two-thirds less likely to contract the disease than those who did not receive the vaccine. All COVID-19 vaccines authorized by WHO for emergency use must demonstrate a high level of efficacyâ€”specifically, a minimum of 50% efficacy in trials to be considered safe and effective.

The distinction between efficacy and effectiveness is significant:
- **Efficacy** refers to the performance of a vaccine under controlled conditions (clinical trials), while 
- **Effectiveness** refers to how well the vaccine performs in real-world settings.

Furthermore, vaccine efficacy can vary based on factors such as the population studied, the nature of the disease, and the vaccine type. For COVID-19 vaccines, ongoing assessments monitor their safety and effectiveness, especially as new variants emerge.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Vaccine effectiveness takes into account all circumstances in the real world, including aspects like public behavior, health conditions, and population demographics. So while clinical trials can show promising efficacy rates, the actual effectiveness may differ when the vaccine is widely administered to the population. Public health measures (like masking and social distancing) are still necessary to combat COVID-19, alongside vaccination.
