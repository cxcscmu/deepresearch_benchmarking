### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Architecture is the art and science of designing structures and environments, deeply influenced by various environmental factors, while environmental psychology studies how these environments affect human behavior.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Architecture**: The term architecture refers to the process and profession of designing buildings and their environments. It encompasses not only the physical structures but also the creative and systematic aspects of planning and constructing. Architectural definitions encapsulate various branches such as landscape architecture and urban planning. Rooted in the Greek derived word 'arkhitekton' meaning 'master builder', architecture combines artistry with utility, evolving through historical contexts into modern practices that seek to harmonize structure with environmental contexts.

**Environmental Influence**: Environmental influences on architecture pivot around how factors like climate, geography, culture, and available materials shape architectural design. The concept of **contextualism** is vital here, which posits that buildings must respond to both their immediate surroundings and the broader environmental conditions. Historical interactions, such as how vernacular architecture adapted to local climates, illustrate this foundational principle. Additionally, **environmental psychology** explores the significant impacts of physical environments on human behavior, highlighting that architectural designs can enhance mental well-being through thoughtful consideration of light, space, and materials.

In contemporary architecture, there has been a movement toward sustainable and ecologically sensitive designs, often termed **green architecture**, which seeks to minimize ecological footprints and enhance resilience against climate challenges. The historical evolution highlights how architectural practices have continuously adapted in response to environmental conditions, leading to a growing recognition of sustainable practices as paramount in future developments.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the dual influence of architecture and environmental conditions is critical for future developments in a world increasingly challenged by climate change. This underscores the necessity for designers and architects to integrate environmental considerations into their work, creating buildings that not only serve structural purposes but also promote sustainability and community well-being.
