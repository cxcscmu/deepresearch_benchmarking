### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The U.S. is currently experiencing a chicken wing shortage driven by increased demand, supply chain issues, and adverse weather conditions. Consumers and restaurants are facing challenges due to limited availability and rising prices.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The chicken wing shortage in 2023 has been exacerbated by several factors including the legacy effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which led to heightened demand for comfort food. Restaurants have seen a surge in chicken wing orders as they are a favored item for takeout and delivery, increasing wing consumption significantly. The National Chicken Council indicated that there are fewer wing stocks available now than at any time since 2011. Additionally, a rare severe winter storm in Texas caused the death of millions of chickens, critically impacting supply as this event coincided with Super Bowl Sunday, traditionally the busiest day for chicken wing consumption in the U.S., where an estimated 1.42 billion wings were consumed.

In response to the ongoing shortage, restaurants like Wingstop have adapted by introducing alternatives, such as chicken thighs through a temporary restaurant concept called 'Thighstop'. This move reflects the necessity to pivot in response to limited supplies of wings while still offering chicken options to consumers. Rising prices for chicken wings have become noticeable, with prices significantly higher compared to earlier years.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Despite the ongoing supply chain challenges, the chicken wing market continues to try to meet consumer demand through innovation and adaptation. The long-term projections for chicken production and potential impacts on prices remain uncertain as producers navigate these ongoing challenges.
