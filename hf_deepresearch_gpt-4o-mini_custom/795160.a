### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Sojourner Truth, born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, escaped from slavery in New York and became a prominent advocate for abolition and women's rights. She delivered her famous speech, "Ain't I a Woman?" at the 1851 Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, and was a key figure in the fight for equality and civil rights.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in Ulster County, New York, around 1797. Initially named Isabella Baumfree, she was sold multiple times and experienced significant abuse during her early life. Her owners included Charles Hardenbergh, who sold her at age nine, and later John Dumont, who reneged on a promise of freedom. In 1826, Truth escaped with her infant daughter, Sophia, and subsequently found work with the Van Wagenen family.

Truth faced further hardship when she discovered her son Peter had been sold into slavery; she won a landmark court case in 1828, becoming the first black woman to successfully sue a white man in court, thus reclaiming her son.

Her religious awakening in freedom led her to become a powerful speaker advocating for abolition and women's rights. In 1851, at the Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, she delivered her iconic speech, "Ain't I a Woman?" This address challenged prevailing gender norms and advocated for the rights of women, particularly those of color, arguing passionately for equality.

Though her speech's content has been debated, with different versions circulating due to the lack of recording technology at the time, its essence remains impactful. Influenced by her Christian faith, Truth became respected and admired for her sharp wit and oratory skills.

She continued to speak out for civil rights, participating in various movements until her death in 1883, leaving an indelible mark on the fight for abolition and gender equality.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Truth's legacy extends beyond her speeches; she was a member of the anti-slavery movement and worked alongside notable activists like Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her life exemplifies the intersection of race, gender, and social justice, inspiring future generations to continue the struggle for equality.
