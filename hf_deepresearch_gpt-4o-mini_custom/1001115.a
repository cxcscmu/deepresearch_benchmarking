### Summary of Findings on American Work Autonomy Preferences

**1. Pew Research Insights:**
- A significant portion of the American public expresses skepticism about work autonomy, especially due to fears related to automation. 
- About **82%** of Americans believe that robots will eventually take over many jobs. 
- Concerns include job security (49% believe job security will decrease) and job benefits (41% expect employee benefits to worsen).
- Despite this skepticism, there's a strong public desire for policies to limit the impact of automation, with **85%** supporting restrictions on automation in jobs that are dangerous to human workers.
- The government is seen as responsible for protecting displaced workers due to automation, with many favoring a guaranteed income (60%).

**2. Gallup Insights:**
- A majority of Americans support personal choice regarding work autonomy, particularly through **71%** favoring right-to-work laws that enable employment without mandatory union membership.
- Although **53%** approve of labor unions, a substantial **82%** believe joining a union shouldn't be mandatory.
- The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards remote work, with **62%** of employed Americans having worked from home during the crisis and many preferring to continue this arrangement.
- The strong preference for personal freedom in labor decisions underscores a societal shift towards valuing autonomy in the workplace.

### Compilation of Perspectives:
Both sources illustrate a distinct separation between the perception of autonomy and actual desires for autonomy in work settings. While Pew highlights general skepticism regarding future job security and the impacts of automation, Gallup reveals a more favorable view towards individual rights and flexibility within work environments. The interplay between these insights underscores the complexity of workforce dynamics and evolving social attitudes towards autonomy in the American labor market.

Given these findings, it is evident that while there is a desire for more autonomy in certain contexts (like choice in union membership), there remain significant concerns about broader implications of automation and job security in the evolving workforce.
