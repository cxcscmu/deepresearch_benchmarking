### Why is the Cost of Gas Rising?

1. **Current Gas Prices**:
   - As of April 22, 2022, average gasoline prices are as follows:
     - NY Harbor: $3.28 per gallon
     - Gulf Coast: $3.20 per gallon
     - Los Angeles: $3.48 per gallon

2. **Historical Perspective**:
   - Historical gas price records show significant fluctuations impacted by various global events and market conditions. The latest comprehensive data available ends in December 2017, as EIA stopped collecting certain indices thereafter.

3. **Factors Influencing Rising Prices**:
   - **Crude Oil Prices**: The largest component of gas prices, crude oil prices have been steadily increasing, significantly impacting costs at the pump as they account for 60%-70% of the retail price.
   - **Taxes and Regulations**: Variable taxes administered by federal, state, and local governments can inflate the per-gallon price consumers pay.
   - **Refining and Distribution Costs**: The logistics associated with refining and transporting gasoline introduce additional costs, contributing to retail prices.
   - **Geopolitical Events**: Recent geopolitical conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have caused significant volatility and uncertainty in energy prices globally.
   - **Economic Conditions**: Inflation and broader economic dynamics impact gas prices, with rising consumer demand also contributing to increased prices.
   - **Alternative Energy Trends**: The push towards alternative energy sources has begun shifting market dynamics but can invoke short-term uncertainty as the transition occurs.
   - **Seasonal Demand**: Fluctuating seasonal demand, particularly during travel peaks, often elevates prices during those periods.
   - **Market Dynamics and Consumer Behavior**: Variations in consumer response to price changes can also influence demand and overall pricing dynamics.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The confluence of high crude oil prices, regulatory frameworks, geopolitical tensions, economic inflation, and shifting consumer demand all play significant roles in why gas prices are rising. Continuous monitoring of these factors is essential for understanding future trends in gas pricing.

This synthesized report highlights the complexity of gas pricing and the various elements that consumers and policymakers must consider moving forward.
