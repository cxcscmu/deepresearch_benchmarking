### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Several legislative measures have been implemented globally to address court delays, each showing varying degrees of effectiveness. Key strategies include setting statutory timelines, limiting expert testimonies, and reforms to civil procedure rules.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **Current Measures**: Many jurisdictions are focusing on reforms in their court systems to reduce delays. In the UK, new initiatives in family courts restrict expert evidence to only what is necessary, aiming to streamline cases. In India, courts are now bound by strict statutory timelines for civil trials, attempting to enhance efficiency in case management. Washington State implemented various legislative changes in 2021 to assist Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, ensuring better processing of cases.
  
- **Effectiveness of Measures**: The challenges remain significant, as there have been reports of continuing delays in civil trial processes despite reforms. For example, claims in the civil courts are still taking an average of 49 weeks from issue to trial, reflecting a slow recovery post-pandemic. Previous reforms, such as those introduced by Lord Woolf, addressed delays but have not eliminated them completely. Moreover, the criminal justice reform literature highlights that systemic inefficiencies persist and often result in the public losing confidence in the judicial process.
  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: The studies suggest adopting integrated strategies that are sustainable and focus on measuring outcomes. This includes evaluations to confirm that the reforms are effective and transparent, enhancing accountability through clear metrics.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The impact of COVID-19 on judicial efficiency has been profound, with reports citing a year or more needed to return to pre-pandemic court efficiency levels. Therefore, while recent legislative efforts are a step in the right direction, ongoing monitoring and reform will be essential to genuinely address court delays in various legal systems.
