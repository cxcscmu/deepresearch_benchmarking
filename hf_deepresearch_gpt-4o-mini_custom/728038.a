### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two foundational concepts in employee motivation. Maslow's theory outlines a progression of needs from physiological to self-actualization, while Herzberg's theory separates factors that lead to satisfaction and dissatisfaction in the workplace.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):  
**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**:
1. **Physiological Needs**: Basic requirements such as food, water, warmth, and rest. These are the essential needs an employee must meet to function.
2. **Safety Needs**: Once physiological needs are fulfilled, the focus shifts to safety needs, including job security, health, and well-being.
3. **Social Needs**: Employees seek relationships, friendships, and a sense of belonging in their workplace.
4. **Esteem Needs**: This involves seeking respect, status, recognition, and self-esteem.
5. **Self-Actualization**: The highest level, where employees seek personal growth, self-improvement, and fulfillment of potential.  
Employees are motivated based on their level of need satisfaction. Unmet lower-level needs can lead to dissatisfaction, hindering overall motivation.

**Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory**:
Herzberg's theory, developed from interviews of over 200 employees, classifies workplace factors into two categories:
1. **Hygiene Factors**: These include salary, company policies, working conditions, interpersonal relationships, and job security. If these factors are inadequate, they can lead to dissatisfaction, but their presence does not necessarily motivate employees.
2. **Motivating Factors**: These pertain to factors like achievement, recognition, responsibility, and opportunities for growth. Their presence can truly motivate employees to perform better and be more satisfied with their jobs.

Herzberg emphasizes that managers should focus on enhancing motivating factors to boost job satisfaction and performance among employees. Both theories underscore the importance of understanding employee needs and perceptions to foster a motivated, satisfied workforce.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):  
Both theories have significantly influenced management practices. Understanding these frameworks can help organizations tailor their motivation strategies, ensuring that they foster both job satisfaction and high performance.
