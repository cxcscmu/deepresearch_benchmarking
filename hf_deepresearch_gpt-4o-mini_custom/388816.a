{'short_version': 'People are attracted to violent movies when they perceive these depictions as meaningful, as they believe they can gain insights into the nature of violence or the human condition.', 'detailed_version': 'The study conducted by researchers from the University of Augsburg, Germany, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison involved 482 participants from Germany and the US, ranging in age from 18 to 82. The researchers aimed to explore why audiences are drawn to movies featuring bloodshed and violence. Participants viewed film trailers with varying degrees of gore and meaningfulness and assessed their likelihood of watching the full movie while providing their perceptions of the film characteristics such as gory, meaningful, and thought-provoking. Findings suggest that previous assumptions about viewers primarily seeking thrills and suspense from violent content only tell part of the story. The study indicates that viewers also pursue truth-seeking motivations, which enhance their desire to engage with violent scenes that offer deeper meaning. Specifically, scenes perceived as meaningful can evoke empathy for victims, admiration for courage, or self-reflection about violent impulses. Thus, depictions of violence that appear profound and thought-provoking can foster positive emotional and cognitive responses among viewers, leading to a heightened interest in watching such films.', 'additional_context': "The document presents findings reported at the 63rd Annual Conference of the International Communication Association. It serves as a summary of the research that aims to unpack the psychological motivations behind viewing violent movies. The study counters earlier claims by highlighting that people's attraction to violent portrayals is multidimensional, including a significant interest in the moral and philosophical implications of violence. Such insights can contribute to broader discussions on media consumption, psychology, and the societal impacts of violent portrayals in entertainment. The findings underline the importance of understanding audiences' motivations beyond mere enjoyment of thrills, suggesting that engaging with violence in film can facilitate important reflections on human nature and societal issues."}
