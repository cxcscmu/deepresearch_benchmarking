### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average atmospheric temperature due to the greenhouse effect, primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Global warming is defined as a significant and persistent rise in the Earth's average temperature, attributed mainly to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere. It is a major aspect of climate change, influencing various climatic conditions and leading to severe environmental impacts.

#### Causes of Global Warming:
The primary causes of global warming can be categorized as follows:
1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, as well as industrial processes, releases large amounts of CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere.
2. **Deforestation:** The clearing of forests reduces the planet's capacity to absorb carbon emissions, exacerbating climate change.
3. **Agricultural Practices:** Activities such as livestock production contribute significantly to methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.
4. **Natural Factors:** While human activities are the primary drivers, natural phenomena, including volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation, also influence climatic conditions.

#### Effects of Global Warming:
The effects of global warming are far-reaching and include:
1. **Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers:** Increased temperatures lead to rapid melting in Arctic and Antarctic regions, contributing to rising sea levels.
2. **Rising Sea Levels:** As ice melts, global sea levels are rising, which threatens coastal communities with flooding and erosion.
3. **Extreme Weather Events:** Higher temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe weather events, including heatwaves, storms, and heavy rainfall.
4. **Impact on Ecosystems and Biodiversity:** Species that cannot adapt to changing climates are facing extinction, disrupting ecosystems and food webs.
5. **Ocean Acidification:** Increased CO2 levels are causing the oceans to become more acidic, adversely affecting marine life such as coral reefs.
6. **Human Health Issues:** Global warming poses risks to human health through increased heat-related illnesses and the proliferation of diseases.

#### Historical Context:
Historical temperature records maintained by institutions like NASA and NOAA show a marked increase in global temperatures since the 19th century. The average global temperature has risen approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 1800s, with significant acceleration observed in the past few decades due to industrialization and urbanization.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Addressing global warming requires comprehensive policy measures, international cooperation, and advancements in technology. Initiatives like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, emphasizing the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally.
