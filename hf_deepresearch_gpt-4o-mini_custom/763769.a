### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Methods for protecting nature include conservation strategies, environmental policies, and community initiatives, all of which are integral in biodiversity preservation. These approaches are supported by statistical evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in preventing species extinction and promoting sustainable practices.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
1. **Conservation Strategies**: 
   - The **World Conservation Strategy** was developed by IUCN, UNEP, and WWF, aiming for sustainable use of ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity. It outlined approaches that lead to sustainability in the use of ecological processes and wildlife. This includes reforestation, habitat protection, and species recovery programs.
   - The **Global Strategy for Plant Conservation** aims to protect plant diversity, which is crucial for ecosystem functioning. Plants are essential for carbon capture, soil fertility, and habitat for many species. 
   - Recent research indicates that conservation actions have prevented **21-32 bird and 7-16 mammal extinctions** since 1993, and **9-18 bird and 2-7 mammal extinctions** since 2010, demonstrating the effectiveness of strategic conservation actions (Society for Conservation Biology).  

2. **Environmental Policies**: 
   - In the U.S., environmental policies are enacted at federal, state, and local levels to balance economic development with environmental protection. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, which all aim to maintain biodiversity and protect natural resources. 
   - Policy frameworks also include international agreements like the Convention on Biological Diversity, which among other things, sets targets for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss.  

3. **Community Initiatives**: 
   - **Community-based conservation** emphasizes local community participation in biodiversity protection. Through this approach, locals contribute their knowledge and priorities alongside scientific methods, leading to more successful and sustainable conservation outcomes. 
   - For instance, initiatives offer training and support for sustainable land use practices, enabling communities to balance ecological health with livelihoods. Programs that empower communities have been shown to have a longer-lasting impact on conservation efforts.  

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Effective conservation requires a holistic approach that integrates strategies, policies, and community engagement. Collaboration among various stakeholders—including governments, NGOs, and local communities—enhances the success of conservation actions. Furthermore, ongoing research and adaptation of strategies based on evidence and feedback are crucial to addressing the evolving challenges posed by climate change and biodiversity loss.
