### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, primarily over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, has historical roots dating back to the early 20th century, accentuated by territorial and ethnic tensions, evolving through various conflicts. The most significant escalations occurred during the late Soviet period and into the 1990s, culminating in ongoing hostilities that have continued into the 21st century.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The conflict has its origins steeped in centuries of historical events. Initially, the region known today as Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) has roots dated as early as 189 BC when it was part of ancient Armenia. The region has seen various influences and annexations, notably when it was incorporated into Soviet Azerbaijan in 1923 despite its majority Armenian population.

- **1918-1920**: Following the collapse of the Russian Empire after World War I, both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence, sparking territorial disputes.
- **1988-1991**: The modern phase of conflict ignited in February 1988 when the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh sought to join Armenia. This led to widespread violence, escalating into war by 1991 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
- **1994**: A ceasefire was established after a war that saw Armenia gain control of Nagorno-Karabakh, leaving Azerbaijan with significant territorial losses, leading to a protracted stalemate.
- **Post-1994**: Periodic skirmishes continued, and the region remained a flashpoint for tensions between the two nations, with numerous ceasefire violations reported.
- **2020 Escalation**: In September 2020, fighting erupted again, resulting in considerable casualties and territorial shifts, significantly altering the status quo established in 1994 and drawing international concern.

The conflict remains complex, influenced by regional geopolitics and the identities of both nations, complicated further by external powers including Russia and Turkey, each backing their respective allies. The ethnic and religious divisions between the predominantly Christian Armenians and Sunni Muslim Azerbaijanis amplify the conflict.

As of now, diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan remain non-existent, and peace efforts have struggled to gain traction amidst ongoing violence and mutual distrust.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The conflict not only impacts Armenia and Azerbaijan but also threatens stability in the South Caucasus region. Various international entities, including the OSCE Minsk Group (comprising Russia, France, and the U.S.), have attempted to mediate but with limited results. The humanitarian cost of the conflict has been severe, with thousands displaced and a long-standing refugee crisis resultant from the ongoing strife.
