Introduction:
This report investigates the causes of inequality in global cities, focusing on factors such as urban migration, socio-economic dynamics, and public policy responses.

1. Definition of Global Cities:
Global cities are major urban centers that influence global economic, political, and cultural activities. They often serve as hubs for commerce and diverse populations.

2. Income Inequality Statistics:
Income inequality is significant in global cities, with Gini coefficients indicating higher levels of disparity compared to national averages. Urban areas frequently showcase pronounced wealth disparities, expanding the gap between affluent and marginalized communities.

3. Urban Migration Trends:
Approximately 740 million internal and 232 million international migrants are part of the urbanization trend. Urban migration patterns have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, initially leading to an exodus from cities but now returning to urban settings as conditions stabilize.

4. Impact on Inequality:
Urban migration leads to strained resources and increases socio-economic divides, with migrants often facing barriers to integration despite higher education levels. Cities like New York and San Francisco exemplify the challenges in managing diverse populations while addressing economic disparities.

5. Policy Responses:
Municipal authorities must develop inclusive policies to address the challenges posed by urban migration, focusing on service provision and social cohesion.

Conclusion:
Addressing inequality in global cities necessitates targeted, data-driven policies that foster integration and equitable access to resources, ensuring that urban growth benefits all residents.
