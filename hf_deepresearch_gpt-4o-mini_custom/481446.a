## Health Impacts of Steroid Use
Steroid use, particularly anabolic steroids, poses significant long-term health risks for athletes. 
Research highlights the following adverse effects:
- **Cardiovascular Issues**: Increased risks of heart attack, stroke, and hypertension.
- **Mental Health Problems**: Users experience mood swings, aggression, anxiety, and higher rates of depression.
- **Cancer Risk**: There is a potential increase in neoplasms among users, especially in relation to hormone-sensitive cancers.

## Social Implications
Steroid scandals have profoundly impacted public perception of athletes and the integrity of sports:
- **Loss of Trust**: High-profile scandals lead to widespread distrust in athletes.
- **Tarnished Reputations**: Athletes face severe repercussions such as lost endorsements and stripped titles.
- **Influence on Youth**: The normalization of doping can trickle down to young athletes, who may view steroid use as a viable means to enhance performance.

## Notable Scandals
Several athletes have faced serious repercussions after steroid-related incidents, including:
- **Marion Jones**: Stripped of her Olympic medals and served prison time for perjury related to steroid use.
- **Lance Armstrong**: Stripped of Tour de France titles and faced extensive public backlash after admitting to doping.
- **Ben Johnson**: Lost gold medals from the 1988 Olympics after testing positive for steroids.

## Regulatory Responses
In response to these scandals, major sports organizations have implemented stricter anti-doping policies, including:
- **WADA**: Maintains a Prohibited List and reviews it annually to ensure proper regulation.
- **NFL**: Implements random testing with escalating penalties for violations.
- **MLB**: Has a rigorous drug policy with strict penalties, including lifetime bans for repeat offenders.
- **FIFA**: Aligns its regulations with WADA, emphasizing athlete health and fair competition.

## Rehabilitation Efforts
Rehabilitation for athletes after scandals often includes:
- **Psychological Counseling**: Helping athletes cope with public scrutiny and mental health issues.
- **Public Relations Management**: Employers guide athletes through repairing their public image and rebuilding their reputations.

## Conclusion
The negatives associated with steroids—ranging from health risks to cultural impacts on sports—illustrate why they shouldn't be allowed in athletics. The ongoing fight against doping highlights the importance of integrity in sports and the need to protect both athletes and the spirit of competition.
