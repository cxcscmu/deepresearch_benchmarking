### Conclusion:
Margaret Thatcher's policies evoke mixed reviews; they succeeded in driving an economic revival and branded her as a formidable leader on the global stage. However, these policies also fostered social divisions and unrest within the UK. The long-term implications of her policies continue to influence contemporary British politics and discourse. Thus, whether her policies "worked" can be seen from varying perspectives: economically they revived growth but socially they led to significant discontent.
