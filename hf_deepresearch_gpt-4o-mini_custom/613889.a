### 1. Task outcome (short version):
More men commit crimes than women due to a combination of biological, sociological, and cultural factors. Men are statistically more involved in violent and serious crimes, while socialization patterns contribute to the differences in criminal behavior between genders.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Studies show that men are significantly more likely to commit crimes than women, with males accounting for approximately 80% of serious crimes. This crime disparity holds true across various societies and historical periods. Key reasons identified in sociological studies include:
- **Biological Factors**: Some theories suggest that biological differences, such as hormonal influences, may predispose men to risk-taking behaviors, potentially leading to higher crime rates.
- **Socialization and Gender Roles**: The way boys and girls are raised often leads to different social expectations. Men are frequently encouraged to be assertive, dominant, and competitive, traits that can correlate with criminal behavior, especially in violent crimes. In contrast, women are socialized to be more nurturing and compliant, leading to lower engagement in criminal activities.
- **Opportunity Theory**: Men are more likely to find themselves in situations where criminal behavior is an option due to their social roles and opportunities in the workforce, leading to higher rates of criminal activities.
- **Cultural Norms**: Societal norms and expectations around masculinity can pressure men into demonstrating toughness and aggression, which may contribute to higher rates of crime. 
- **Economic Factors**: Economic hardship can drive both genders to crime, but men historically have had more access to criminal networks and opportunities that align with their societal roles.

In terms of types of crimes, men commit more violent crimes such as murder (90% of murderers are male), while women are more likely to engage in non-violent crimes. Additionally, societal constructs also influence the likelihood of being victimized; women are disproportionately victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
This gender disparity in crime is not absolute; female crime rates have risen in recent decades. Understanding the sociological implications not only illuminates the reasons behind gender differences in crime but also highlights the underlying societal issues that may contribute to these trends.
