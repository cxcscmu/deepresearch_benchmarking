# Report on How Climate Change Affects Sea Level

## 1. Introduction
Climate change is causing significant impacts on global sea levels through mechanisms such as melting polar ice caps and glaciers, thermal expansion of seawater, and land subsidence. 

## 2. Historical Context
According to various IPCC reports, the global mean sea level has increased due to climate change. As per historical sea level data compiled from tide gauges and satellite altimetry, average sea levels have been rising consistently over the past century. 
- The Church and White (2011) study indicates that global sea levels rose by approximately 19 centimeters from 1901 to 2010, with an acceleration noted in the last few decades.

## 3. Current Projections
Recent assessments reveal that:
- By 2050, global mean sea levels could rise by approximately 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters).
- By 2100, projections suggest a rise of 2 to 7 feet (0.6 to 2.1 meters) depending on greenhouse gas emissions.

## 4. Adaptation Strategies
The IPCC recommends several strategies for adaptation, which include:
- **Coastal Management Policies**: Developing regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable coastal areas.
- **Ecosystem-Based Approaches**: Restoring coastal ecosystems to provide natural barriers.
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Investing in flood defenses and sustainable urban planning.
- **Community Engagement**: Encouraging public awareness and participation in adaptation strategies.

## 5. Conclusion
Climate change poses a severe risk to sea levels, threatening coastal systems and communities. Adaptive strategies are crucial for mitigating these risks and can help reduce vulnerabilities as we move into the future. Proactive measures must be integrated into urban development and policy frameworks to safeguard both human and natural ecosystems against rising seas.
