### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Businesses can adopt several strategies and technologies to become carbon neutral, which include innovations in renewable energy, carbon-negative manufacturing, and sustainable agricultural practices.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
To become carbon neutral, businesses should focus on the following strategies and technologies:  
- **Examples of Companies**: Major companies such as Microsoft, Sky, Logitech, and Lime have adopted carbon neutrality practices by reducing emissions, switching to renewable energy, and offsetting carbon footprints. These practices not only enhance their corporate image but also offer operational savings and positive social impact.  
- **Strategies for Carbon Neutrality**:  
  - **Reducing Emissions**: Businesses should implement energy efficiency measures and transition to renewable energy sources.  
  - **Waste Management**: Investing in waste valorization technologies can significantly decrease emissions associated with waste disposal.  
  - **Sustainable Practices**: Redesigning supply chains to include sustainable sourcing and production practices can enhance overall sustainability.  
  - **Carbon Offsetting**: Companies can invest in carbon offset projects such as reforestation or renewable energy initiatives to compensate for remaining emissions.  

- **Technologies for Achieving Carbon Neutrality**:  
  - **Renewable Energy Production**: Utilizing solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to replace fossil fuels.  
  - **Food System Transformation**: Reforming agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability.  
  - **Waste Valorization**: Converting waste into resources to minimize environmental impact.  
  - **Conservation of Carbon Sinks**: Protecting forests and wetlands to enhance carbon sequestration.  
  - **Carbon-Negative Manufacturing**: Innovating manufacturing processes that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere rather than just minimizing emissions.  

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The journey towards carbon neutrality is crucial for mitigating climate change impacts. Businesses of all sizes can benefit from aligning their operations with sustainability goals. By adopting innovative technologies and strategies, companies contribute to a sustainable future and help meet global carbon neutrality objectives.
