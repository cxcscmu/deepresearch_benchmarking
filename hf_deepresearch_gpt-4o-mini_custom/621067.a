### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The U.S. involvement in World War I was primarily influenced by two key events: the Zimmermann Telegram, which proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico against the U.S., and Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, which targeted civilian and neutral ships, leading to American casualties and a shift in public sentiment toward war.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The historical reasons for U.S. involvement in World War I are complex, characterized by a mix of diplomatic intrigues and aggressive military actions that ultimately shifted American public and political opinion.

Initially, the United States held a strong isolationist stance, particularly under President Woodrow Wilson, who campaigned on the platform of keeping America out of the war. However, the United States' position began to erode due to several events:

1. **Unrestricted Submarine Warfare**: On February 1, 1917, Germany resumed its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, attacking any ship—military or civilian—without warning. This decision provoked outrage in the U.S., particularly following the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, a British ocean liner that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 civilians, including 128 Americans. The attack symbolized a brutal departure from more 'civilized' warfare and became a powerful propaganda tool that swayed public sentiment against Germany.

2. **The Zimmermann Telegram**: In January 1917, German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann sent a secret telegram to Mexico, proposing a military alliance against the United States should it enter the war. The telegram promised Mexico the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona if Germany won. This revelation, intercepted and decoded by British intelligence, was made public and further inflamed American public opinion, leading many to push for war.

The combination of these factors—multiple submarine attacks on American and neutral ships along with the incendiary content of the Zimmermann Telegram—led to a significant shift in public sentiment. As demands to enter the war grew louder, Wilson faced mounting pressure to act. Ultimately, on April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany, signaling a decisive shift in American foreign policy from isolationism to active involvement in global conflicts.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The U.S. entry into World War I significantly changed the trajectory of the war. American troops, resources, and morale proved pivotal in the eventual defeat of the Central Powers and shaped post-war treaties, including the Treaty of Versailles. The war also marked a turning point in U.S. foreign policy, establishing the nation as a prominent global power.
