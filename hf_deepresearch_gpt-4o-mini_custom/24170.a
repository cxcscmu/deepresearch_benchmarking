- Advocacy organizations emphasize the intersection of gun control measures and mental health support for effective prevention.

**IV. Preventive Measures Implemented in Schools**

**VI. Recommendations for Action**
- Employ a broader, more integrated approach that incorporates education, community support, and mental health resources alongside physical security measures.
- Community-centric initiatives should focus on reducing stigma around mental health support and equip educators with skills to identify and intervene in students' issues proactively.

**VII. Conclusion**
Comprehensive strategies to prevent school shootings must evolve and incorporate successful practices demonstrated through empirical data. Building safe, supportive educational environments that prioritize mental health, threat assessment, and community involvement is essential for mitigating risks associated with school shootings.
