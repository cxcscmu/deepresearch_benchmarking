Innovation is fundamentally defined as the act of introducing new ideas, processes, products, or services that create value. Key drivers include economic factors (investment in R&D and market demand), technological advancements (AI, telemedicine), social engagement (community initiatives), and organizational culture (leadership support). Each component interacts, forming a robust ecosystem that fosters innovation, reflected in examples such as Google's driverless cars and healthy meal initiatives. Effective collaboration across these dimensions can lead to transformative changes in society and the economy.
