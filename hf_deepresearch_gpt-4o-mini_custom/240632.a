### 1. Current Statistics on School Bus Drivers
As of 2022, there are approximately 168,661 school bus drivers in the United States. 
The average age of a school bus driver is 57.4 years with 45% of drivers being male and 55% female. 
Regarding race, 71.8% are White, followed by 13.7% who are Hispanic or Latino. 
Education-wise, 35% hold a high school diploma, and 24% have an associate degree. 
The ongoing national shortage of school bus drivers has been described as severe, with many districts still struggling to maintain adequate staffing levels heading into the school year for 2023. Various states are experiencing heightened difficulties in recruiting and retaining school bus drivers following the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### 2. Reasons for the Shortage of School Bus Drivers
The shortage of school bus drivers in 2023 is primarily attributed to several interrelated factors:

- **Economic Factors:** Median salaries are around $35,421 per year, leading many potential applicants to seek better-paying jobs, especially as enhanced unemployment benefits during the pandemic deterred individuals from applying for lower-paying jobs.

- **Recruitment Challenges:** The requirement for a commercial driverâ€™s license (CDL) creates barriers for potential drivers. DMV operations were limited during the pandemic, hindering the certification process, while competition with other sectors offering better pay also complicates recruitment.

- **Demographic Factors:** Many drivers are nearing retirement age, and health concerns during the pandemic have led many drivers to exit the workforce. Parents traditionally stepping in as drivers are reluctant due to ongoing safety considerations related to COVID-19.

- **Mental and Physical Health Concerns:** Ongoing pandemic-related health anxieties have led many to stay cautious or leave the workforce, particularly regarding jobs perceived as high-risk.

### 3. Additional Context
The shortage is part of a broader trend affecting many sectors, and schools are attempting various solutions to attract and retain drivers, including incentives and flexible scheduling. However, the profound nature of this crisis indicates that long-term solutions will be necessary.
