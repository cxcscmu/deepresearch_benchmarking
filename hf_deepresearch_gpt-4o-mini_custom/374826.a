In recent years, the debate on whether mobile applications will make traditional web browsing irrelevant has become increasingly relevant. With the significant rise in mobile device usage and the advent of new technologies, understanding current trends is vital.
### Current Trends in App Usage
As of 2023, mobile app usage continues to dominate over web usage, with users spending around 4.8 hours per day on mobile devices, 88% of which is spent in apps. Key drivers include social media and streaming platforms, making them an integral part of modern life. The mobile app market boasts over 6.3 billion smartphone users.

### Current Trends in Web Usage
Despite having approximately 2 billion websites, only about 400 million are active, reflecting a decline in web engagement. Users still browse an average of over 130 web pages per day, indicating that while web browsing is prevalent, it is decreasing as mobile apps gain traction.

### Expert Predictions
Experts predict that the mobile app ecosystem will continue to dominate in 2023 due to user preference for convenience and security. Omer Kaplan, CMO at ironSource, highlights that in-app ecosystems offer safer environments for brands. Though web technologies are evolving with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and AI-driven experiences, they may struggle to match the immersive capabilities of mobile applications.

### Conclusion
The evidence suggests that while apps are becoming an essential part of daily life, the web is not on the verge of becoming irrelevant. Each platform serves distinct purposes and preferences. Apps are favored for direct engagement and specific functionalities, while the web remains crucial for broader information access and e-commerce. 
Thus, rather than being rendered irrelevant, the web is likely to continue evolving alongside mobile applications, with both playing significant roles in the digital landscape.
