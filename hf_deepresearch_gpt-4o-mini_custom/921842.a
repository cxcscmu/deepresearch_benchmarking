### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The definition of vaccine safety as provided by the WHO describes it as the assurance that vaccines do what they are intended to do â€” protect individuals from diseases while keeping them safe from adverse reactions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Vaccines are administered to save lives and preserve health, and are considered among the safest medicinal products available. They are typically given to healthy individuals, including very young children. While the majority of vaccinated persons may only experience mild and temporary reactions, a small fraction may face rare but more severe adverse effects. 

- The Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint developed by WHO emphasizes governance and coordination of safety systems and aims to enhance vaccine safety and efficacy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
- Similarly, the CDC defines vaccine safety as a rigorous scientific assessment and monitoring process to ensure vaccines are safe for public use.
  - Vaccines undergo clinical trials to evaluate their safety before being licensed.
  - The CDC employs several monitoring systems, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for reporting health problems after vaccination, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) which conducts research on vaccine safety.
  - While mild side effects are common (like pain at the injection site), serious adverse effects are rare, and the monitoring systems help detect and mitigate any potential safety concerns.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Concerns about vaccine safety, whether real or perceived, can deter individuals from getting vaccinated, as seen in both industrialized countries and LMICs. The ongoing monitoring efforts and research in vaccine safety are vital for maintaining public confidence and promoting health through immunization.

Based on the collected data, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that vaccines are safe and effective, and while they are not 100% without risks, the benefits of vaccination in preventing disease greatly outweigh the potential risks of serious side effects. 

Thus, it is inaccurate to claim that vaccines are dangerous without considering the overall evidence supporting their safety and efficacy.
