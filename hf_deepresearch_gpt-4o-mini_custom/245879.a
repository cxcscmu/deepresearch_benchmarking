### How Deforestation Causes Climate Change

1. **Definition and Causes of Deforestation**
   Deforestation refers to the long-term loss of forest cover primarily driven by agricultural expansion, logging, and urban development. Major causes include:
   - Cattle ranching
   - Soybean farming
   - Palm oil production
   - Illegal logging

2. **Statistics on Deforestation Rates**
   The world lost approximately 20 million acres of primary forest from 1990 to 2020, with an annual deforestation rate averaging around 14,800 square miles, equivalent to a football field lost every second.

3. **Impact on Climate Change**
   Deforestation contributes about 15% of global carbon emissions. When forests are cleared, the carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in trees is released into the atmosphere, enhancing greenhouse gas concentrations.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**
   Deforestation has significant impacts on biodiversity, as approximately 80% of terrestrial species rely on forest ecosystems. The economic value of biodiversity loss from deforestation is estimated between $2 trillion and $4.5 trillion annually.

5. **Regional Implications**
   - Latin America is responsible for 54% of global forest loss, with critical impacts observed in the Amazon rainforest.
   - Haiti has lost more than 99% of its original forest cover, indicating severe ecological consequences.

6. **Urgency for Action**
   The alarming statistics surrounding deforestation emphasize the urgent need for action. Current trends may lead to catastrophic consequences for ecosystems and human populations, necessitating immediate protective measures for remaining forests.

Conclusion:
To mitigate climate change impacts, protecting and restoring forests is critical as they are vital carbon sinks and provide essential habitats for countless species.
