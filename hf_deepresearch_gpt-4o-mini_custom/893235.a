1. **Toyota's Unintended Acceleration Recall (2009):**  
   - Toyota recalled approximately eight million vehicles due to defects leading to unintended acceleration, triggered by a collision resulting in fatalities.  
   - The recall led to substantial financial impacts, including a settlement of $1.2-$1.4 billion for class-action lawsuits, damages to reputation, and hefty fines totaling $33 million for delays in reporting defects.
