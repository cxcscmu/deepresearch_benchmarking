### Report on the Duration of Gender Barriers

#### 1. Introduction
Over the years, the journey toward gender equality has been a slow and challenging process, often hindered by deeply entrenched cultural norms, historical legacies, and legislative gaps. 

#### 2. Historical Context
- **Suffrage Movement**: The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked the rise of the suffragette movement which laid the groundwork for women's rights, ultimately leading to many countries granting women the right to vote after World War I.
- **Second-Wave Feminism (1970s)**: This era was characterized by significant publications and the establishment of Women's Studies programs. Milestones include the Equal Pay Act of 1970 and the Women’s Strike for Equality.
  
#### 3. Legislative Milestones
- **1980s-1990s**: Global initiatives like the Nairobi Conference in 1985 established frameworks for women’s rights. The 1995 Beijing Declaration was pivotal for enhancing gender equality.
- **2000s Onwards**: Legislative efforts continued with acts like the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act (2009) aimed at addressing wage discrimination. 

#### 4. Societal and Cultural Norms
Despite progressive legislative changes, societal attitudes towards gender roles and stereotypes have historically been slow to evolve. Many countries still uphold laws that discriminate against women, demonstrating a gap between legal equality and social practice.

#### 5. Current Challenges
Today, the fight for gender equality faces new challenges such as rising wage gaps, political representation disparities, and increasing rates of gender-based violence. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these issues as a "shadow pandemic," significantly affecting women's safety and economic status.

#### 6. Conclusion
The combination of historical inertia, cultural resistance, and incomplete legislative protections has contributed to the prolonged existence of gender barriers. Ongoing advocacy and comprehensive legal protections remain essential for achieving true gender equality.
