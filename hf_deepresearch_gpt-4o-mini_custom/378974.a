### 1. Introduction
The Holocaust, which resulted in the genocide of six million Jews during World War II, prompted varying responses from countries worldwide, particularly by the United States. The U.S. response was marked by a complex interplay of military priorities, domestic policies, and humanitarian efforts, revealing both engagement and inaction.

### 2. Timeline of Key Events
- **1933**: Adolf Hitler appointed Chancellor of Germany.
- **1941**: U.S. enters World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
- **1942**: U.S. State Department confirms plans for the extermination of Jews.
- **January 1944**: Establishment of the War Refugee Board (WRB) to rescue Jews.

### 3. U.S. Government's Response
The awareness of Nazi atrocities began soon after Hitler's rise in 1933, but the U.S. largely focused on military objectives following its entry into WW II. Awareness increased by 1942, with reports of mass murder prompting some public outcry, yet responses remained limited.

- The War Refugee Board was established in January 1944 to facilitate the rescue of Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe.
- Efforts were constrained by limited resources and bureaucratic conflicts; the WRB ultimately saved tens of thousands but operated too late in the war.
- Criticism of U.S. response stems from restrictive immigration policies that severely limited Jewish refugee entry and inadequate action during the early Holocaust years.

### 4. Public Sentiment and Advocacy
Within the U.S., there was public pressure to assist Jewish refugees, influenced by advocacy from organizations and individuals, but systemic barriers limited effective governmental responses.

### 5. Conclusion
The U.S. response to the Holocaust encompassed varying degrees of awareness, prioritization of wartime objectives, and limited humanitarian actions. This complex legacy is crucial in understanding both the historical context and its implications for future American foreign policy concerning humanitarian crises.
