### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Global stratification significantly impacts local cultures by creating both positive and negative consequences. It leads to economic opportunities through multinational corporations, while simultaneously threatening indigenous cultural practices and local identities due to globalization.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Global stratification refers to the unequal distribution of power, wealth, and resources among countries, which creates a hierarchy of nations classified as high, middle, and low-income. For instance, high-income countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan hold a majority of the world's wealth, while poorer nations often struggle with underdevelopment and limited access to resources. 

The impact of global stratification on local cultures can be seen through various lenses:
- **Positive Effects**:  
  - **Economic Opportunities**: Globalization often results in job creation as multinational corporations (MNCs) set up operations in lower-income countries. Companies like Nike and General Motors outsource production to benefit from cheaper labor, providing local employment and potentially raising living standards in the host countries. 
  - **Cultural Exchange**: Global stratification facilitates cultural exchanges, where local traditions and practices can gain international attention, promoting cultural pride and awareness. Technological advancements enable local cultures to be showcased on global platforms, contributing positively to local identities.

- **Negative Effects**:  
  - **Cultural Degradation**: The influx of MNCs often leads to the erosion of indigenous cultures as local practices and lifestyles become overshadowed by Western consumerism and values. This can manifest in the decline of traditional crafts and the uniformity of consumer culture across different regions. 
  - **Social Inequality**: Global stratification can exacerbate social inequalities within countries. High-income countries can impose cultural and economic dominance, causing a divide where elite classes benefit from globalization while the local populace may face exploitation and poor working conditions. 
  - **Dependency**: Lower-income countries may become overly reliant on foreign investment and global markets, risking their economic independence and cultural integrity.

In summary, while global stratification presents opportunities for development and cultural exchange, it simultaneously poses challenges by threatening local cultures, inducing economic dependencies, and reinforcing social inequalities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
This analysis illustrates the dual nature of globalization and stratification, indicating that policymakers should carefully manage the integration of global economic systems while preserving local cultures and identities. Ensuring that local communities benefit from globalization requires intentional strategies to mitigate adverse effects while promoting cultural resilience.
