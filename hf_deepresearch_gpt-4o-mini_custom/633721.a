### 1. Task outcome (short version):
IPO underpricing is primarily caused by factors such as asymmetric information, institutional influences, control theories, and behavioral insights, which exhibit significant variations depending on market context.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The phenomenon of IPO underpricing has been comprehensively analyzed through various theoretical frameworks:

- **Asymmetric Information Theories**: One of the fundamental causes of IPO underpricing is the information asymmetry that exists between insiders (like company executives) and outside investors. Companies often choose to underprice their IPOs to attract investors who may be deterred by uncertainty over the firm's true value. This tactic helps ensure strong demand for the shares, albeit at the cost of potential capital that could have been raised.

- **Institutional Theories**: These theories consider the role of market mechanisms, including the influence of underwriters. Underwriters often face litigation risks; as a consequence, they may price IPOs lower to mitigate post-IPO volatility and foster a stable trading environment. This practice can lead to intentional underpricing as a risk management strategy.

- **Control Theories**: From this perspective, companies may deliberately underprice shares to build a supportive and loyal shareholder base, which can be particularly beneficial in cases where they wish to deter hostile takeovers or to maintain control of the firm.

- **Behavioral Theories**: These theories account for psychological factors affecting investor behavior. Investors may exhibit over-enthusiasm or irrational behavior during IPOs, leading to a bidding frenzy that generates inflated price expectations and thus necessitates slight underpricing to align initial market valuations with realistic outcomes.

Empirical evidence underlines these theoretical perspectives. For instance, studies have demonstrated that IPOs on markets such as the Colombo Stock Exchange reveal an average underpricing of around 47%. Factors influencing this underpricing include offer risk, investor sentiment, firm size, and market volatility. Notably, some IPOs have also been found to be overpriced, indicating varying market behavior shaped by investor expectations and prevailing market conditions.

### 3. Additional context:
Understanding IPO underpricing is crucial for both financial practitioners and academics since it informs the strategies employed by firms in capital markets, especially in emerging economies like China. In these markets, the dynamics can differ markedly from those in developed markets, necessitating tailored approaches to IPO pricing. Insights from empirical studies highlight the complexity of market behavior and investor psychology, which can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding capital market engagements.

The findings from the research indicate that IPO underpricing is not simply an isolated phenomenon but rather a reflection of multifaceted interactions between market participants, institutional structures, and behavioral tendencies.
