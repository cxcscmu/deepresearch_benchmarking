### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Overfishing, defined as the harvesting of fish beyond their ability to replenish, has severe economic implications. The NOAA characterizes overfished stocks as populations that are too low, requiring management and rebuilding efforts. The FAO highlights that overfishing jeopardizes food security and local economies, exemplified by the collapse of the cod fishery in Newfoundland, affecting thousands of livelihoods.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Overfishing is the practice of catching fish at a rate that surpasses their reproduction, leading to a depletion of fish populations. According to NOAA, an 'overfished stock' is defined as a fish population that has fallen below a minimum sustainable level, necessitating immediate rebuilding efforts. Factors contributing to this status include overfishing itself, but also habitat destruction, pollution, and changing climate conditions. Economic principles regarding overfishing focus on the balance between harvesting fish to meet human needs and maintaining sustainable populations for future generations.

The economic impact of overfishing is profound, as seen in the example of the cod fishery off Newfoundland. Years of overfishing led to the collapse of the cod population, resulting in the loss of livelihoods for 40,000 people and causing significant ecological damage. Reports emphasize the importance of responsible fisheries management practices, such as setting annual catch limits, to prevent economic and environmental devastation associated with the depletion of fish stocks. The sustainability of fisheries is crucial for ensuring the stability of communities that rely on fishing as a primary source of income and food.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act mandates annual reporting on the status of fish stocks, ensuring that the management of these resources incorporates scientific assessments to prevent overfishing. The FAO and NOAA continue to advocate for sustainable fishing practices, underscoring the necessity of balancing human consumption with ecological preservation to support long-term fishing and economic viability.
