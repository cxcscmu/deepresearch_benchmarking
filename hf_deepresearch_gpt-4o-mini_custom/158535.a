    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):
    Selling a home can impact Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits by potentially making an individual ineligible temporarily if the proceeds from the sale exceed asset limits. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits are not affected by the sale.

    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
    - **SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance):**
      - Selling a house does not affect SSDI benefits. SSDI is not influenced by the recipient’s assets or income from property sales.

    - **SSI (Supplemental Security Income):**
      - The proceeds from selling a home can impact SSI eligibility. Individuals receiving SSI must adhere to strict asset limits: $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples.
      - If the money from the sale of a home puts the individual’s assets over these limits, they could lose their SSI benefits temporarily until their assets decrease.
      - The sale proceeds must be managed carefully to maintain eligibility, as having more income can lead to losing other assistance like Medicaid. If the excess funds are used to purchase another home or pay off debts, this can mitigate the impact.
      - It's essential to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the sale and how the proceeds will be used to avoid interruption of benefits. The funds should ideally be reinvested into new housing or other qualified expenses to maintain SSI eligibility.
      - The concept of "home exclusion" allows the home you live in generally not to be counted toward the asset limit for SSI purposes.

    - **Additional Context:**
      - Carefully managing any excess funds from home sales is vital to maintaining SSI benefits. Consultations with financial advisors or Social Security lawyers are encouraged to navigate these complexities successfully.
