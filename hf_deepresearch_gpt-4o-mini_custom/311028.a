### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Recent studies indicate that climate change significantly impacts agriculture, affecting crop yields and food supply, with projections highlighting challenges that could begin as early as 2030.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Recent research highlights that climate change poses severe threats to agriculture and food security. 
1. **Impact on Crop Yields:** Studies have shown that increased temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and rising carbon dioxide levels will reduce agricultural productivity. A NASA study forecasts that by 2030, global supplies of core crops like corn and wheat will begin facing drastic changes, with major shifts in crop productivity expected as the century progresses. 
2. **Effects on Key Crops:** Staples such as wheat, maize, and rice are projected to experience reduced yields due to climatic changes. The IPCC report indicates that climate-related impacts are already being felt, particularly in regions close to the equator where adaptive capacity may be exceeded.
3. **Food Supply and Security Concerns:** The decline in crop yields could lead to increased price volatility and reduce the quality of food, affecting global food security. Reports indicate that developing countries will be particularly vulnerable, suffering more pronounced drops in agricultural productivity and facing rising food prices.
4. **Adaptation Challenges:** While farmers can adapt in some ways, there are limits to how much can be managed; this adaptability is substantially strained in the tropics. The trend is alarming given that a significant portion of the world's caloric intake relies on a limited number of crops, with roughly 83% of consumable food calories coming from just ten major crops.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Current observations suggest that the impacts of climate change on crop production are not uniform across regions. Farming practices may require significant adjustments to maintain productivity levels, and while mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary, they have to be implemented urgently to combat impending challenges.
