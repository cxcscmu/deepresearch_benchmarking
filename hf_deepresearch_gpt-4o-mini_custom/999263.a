### The League of Nations and Its Role in Causing World War II

**1. Background and Establishment**
The League of Nations was created in 1919 after World War I with the intent to maintain international peace and cooperation among nations. Inspired by the devastation of the war, it aimed to prevent future conflicts through collective security, disarmament, and mediation of disputes.

**2. Functions and Early Successes**
Key functions of the League included:
- Maintenance of international peace through negotiation and arbitration.
- Promoting disarmament and the rule of law.
- Addressing global issues such as health and refugees.

In its early years, the League had some successes, such as mediating disputes over the Aaland Islands and Upper Silesia.

**3. Major Failures Leading to World War II**
Despite its early successes, the League became increasingly ineffective during the 1930s. Key failures included:
- **Manchurian Crisis (1931)**: Japan invaded Manchuria, and despite an investigation by the Lytton Commission, the League was unable to take effective action or enforce its recommendations. Japan disregarded the League's authority and withdrew.
- **Abyssinian Crisis (1935)**: Italy invaded Abyssinia, and the League's response was weak due to ineffective sanctions and secret deals, exemplified by the Hoare-Laval Pact that aimed to appease Mussolini.

These failures demonstrated the League's lack of enforcement power and decreased international confidence in its ability to maintain peace.

**4. Consequences of the League's Ineffectiveness**
The inability to handle aggression showcased the League's limitations and encouraged totalitarian regimes to pursue aggressive expansionist policies. As nations began to act unilaterally, the stage was set for the outbreak of World War II as tensions escalated.

**5. Conclusion**
The League of Nations, although well-intentioned, ultimately failed to prevent conflict due to its structural weaknesses and reliance on the cooperation of its member states. Its failures in the 1930s, particularly in Manchuria and Abyssinia, highlighted the inadequacies of collective security and led to the rise of powers that would culminate in global conflict. The lessons from the League's shortcomings contributed to the formation of the United Nations, which sought to establish a more robust framework for international peace and cooperation.

### Additional Context
The League's legacy lives on in the framework of the United Nations, which aims to create a more effective global governance structure to prevent future wars.
