## Structured Report on the Death Penalty

### 1. Introduction
The death penalty, or capital punishment, remains one of the most contentious topics within the legal and moral framework of criminal justice systems worldwide. This report aims to analyze various aspects of its legality, effectiveness, historical context, expert opinions, and evolving public sentiments.

### 2. Legal Framework
As of 2023, 55 countries enforce the death penalty, with 28 nations not executing anyone in over a decade yet retaining it in law. Meanwhile, 108 countries have abolished it entirely. Execution practices vary significantly between countries, with only a few using it for extraordinary crimes such as war crimes.

### 3. Deterrent Effect
Evidence indicates that the death penalty does not correlate with lower crime rates. Studies show that states in the U.S. without capital punishment have lower homicide rates. Reports reveal that social science discredits the idea of capital punishment as an effective deterrent to murder, suggesting alternative sentences could be better at reducing crime.

### 4. Historical Context
The death penalty's roots trace back to ancient civilizations like Babylon and China, evolving through various societal norms. In the U.S., it was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976 but faced fluctuating public opinion from a peak of 80% approval in the mid-1990s to around 60% currently. The decline in support arises from increased concerns regarding wrongful convictions and the preference for life sentences without parole.

### 5. Expert Opinions
Ethicists and legal scholars argue about the morality of capital punishment, with many advocating for its abolition. Concerns about fairness, bias, and the possibility of executing innocent individuals heavily underpin these discussions.

### 6. Public Opinion Trends
Public support for the death penalty has seen significant changes. Once a dominant viewpoint, support has steadily declined due to moral considerations and growing recognition of alternate punitive measures, with current polling showing support levels that are the lowest in decades.

### 7. Conclusion
The future of the death penalty seems increasingly uncertain as more nations reconsider its validity, influenced by shifting societal values toward justice and human rights. Continued advocacy for reform could further impact public sentiment and legal practices surrounding capital punishment.
