### Report: How European “Ethnics” Became White

#### 1. Task Outcome (Short Version)
The classifications of "white" and ethnic groups in Europe have evolved through historical and social processes, significantly shaped by colonialism, the rise of scientific racism, and changing migration patterns. The term "white" has not always meant the same thing across time and geography, and ethnic classifications have varied based on socio-political contexts.

#### 2. Task Outcome (Detailed Version)
The classification of people into "white" and ethnic groups in Europe has a long and intricate history, influenced by several key factors:

- **Historical Context**: Initially, the term "race" described groups differentiated by nationality or ethnicity until the 18th century, when it began associating with biological distinctions. This was a shift from earlier classifications that primarily highlighted cultural and linguistic differences.

- **Whiteness and Scientific Racism**: Early racial classifications, including those by figures such as Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, explicitly linked racial categories to social hierarchies. By the 19th century, pseudoscientific theories perpetuated racial categorizations, where groups like the "Caucasoid" were deemed superior based on dubious scientific credentials.

- **Impact of Colonialism**: The European colonial expansion codified racial theories, creating and reinforcing hierarchies that justified the exploitation and domination of colonized populations. This systemic colonialism reinforced the idea of superiority associated with being "white," giving rise to a rigid racial hierarchy.

- **Post-World War II Shifts**: The aftermath of WWII and the Holocaust prompted significant changes in perceptions of race. A widespread rejection of scientific racism and the horrors of genocide led many to demand policies focused on equality, human rights, and inclusion.

- **Contemporary Issues**: The racial landscape in Europe is markedly more complex today due to increases in immigration and multiculturalism. This has spurred debates on identity, leading to new understandings of racial and ethnic identities that highlight intersectionality — acknowledging how different social identities intersect in shaping experiences. Modern discussions underscore that these identities are fluid, context-dependent, and should embrace the complexities of diversity.

#### 3. Additional Context
Understanding the historical context of race and ethnicity in Europe is crucial to addressing contemporary issues such as immigration, nationalism, and systemic racism. Current debates emphasize the importance of inclusive policies that acknowledge and celebrate diversity rather than confine identity to rigid racial or ethnic categories.

### Conclusion
This structured report aims to offer insight into the historical and socio-political nuances that have defined the concept of "whiteness" in Europe, addressing the question of how European "ethnics" became "white" and what changes facilitated this transformation.
