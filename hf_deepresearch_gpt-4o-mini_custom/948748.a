Adult child estrangement from parents is a complex issue influenced by multiple psychological factors. The following points summarize the primary reasons:

This parenting style may stem from genuine concern but often results in emotional disconnection.

- **Lack of Emotional Understanding:** Parents may fail to recognize or value the emotional experiences and needs of their adult children, leading to feelings of invalidation that can foster estrangement.
