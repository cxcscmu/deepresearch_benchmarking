### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The required infrastructure for sales promotion does not exist uniformly in every country. While developed countries often have robust systems and various promotional tools in place, many developing nations face significant hurdles in establishing similar infrastructures.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Sales promotion refers to a variety of activities designed to stimulate consumer demand through incentives and offers. Common sales promotion tools include coupons, rebates, loyalty programs, contests, and promotional events like 'Buy-One-Get-One-Free' (BOGOF) deals.

In developed countries, such as those in North America and Western Europe, the infrastructure for sales promotion is usually well-established. Retailers and brands effectively utilize various techniques to promote their productsâ€”frequently employing digital and traditional marketing strategies tailored to sophisticated consumer bases. For example, 'BOGOF' promotions are quite popular as they encourage trial and increase volume sales without significantly reducing profit margins if executed correctly.

Conversely, in developing countries, promotional infrastructures can be limited. Many companies struggle with lack of resources, poor market access, and lower levels of consumer awareness. Promotional efforts in these regions often rely on third-party advertisements and less sophisticated methods like local exhibitions. As noted in research, businesses in developing countries face challenges not only in executing effective promotions but also in maintaining brand presence amid fierce competition and economic constraints.

Moreover, cultural differences play a significant role in shaping sales promotion practices. In many Eastern and developing countries, traditional marketing approaches can drastically differ from Western practices, leading to variability in the effectiveness of similar promotional strategies.

The comparative analysis of supermarket sales promotion between New Zealand (a developed country) and countries like China and Malaysia (developing nations) shows that as industrialization increases, so does the sophistication of sales promotion strategies employed. This leads to a more extensive range of tools and higher efficacy in promotional campaigns in more industrialized markets. Therefore, while some nations might possess foundational elements of sales promotion infrastructure, the landscape is anything but uniform globally.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
In summary, many developing countries struggle with the requisite infrastructure for effective sales promotion, facing challenges from economic limitations to cultural differences in consumer behavior. As a result, the capacity to engage in effective sales promotion is often significantly hindered, leading to disparities in consumer engagement and brand visibility compared to their developed counterparts.
