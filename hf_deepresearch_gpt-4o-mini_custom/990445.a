### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, preventing government endorsement of religion. Key Supreme Court cases, like *Everson v. Board of Education* (1947) and *Engel v. Vitale* (1962), have defined its boundaries.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The separation of church and state is a foundational principle in American democracy, originating from the First Amendment, which asserts that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This principle is designed to prevent the government from favoring one religion over another or interfering in the free practice of religion.

Historically, the concept evolved through various court rulings:

- **Everson v. Board of Education (1947)**: The Supreme Court ruled that providing public transport for students to parochial schools did not subsidize religious activities directly, thereby setting a precedent for the use of public funds in religious education contexts.

- **Engel v. Vitale (1962)**: In this landmark decision, the Court found that a New York State law authorizing a short, voluntary prayer for recitation in public schools violated the Establishment Clause, asserting that government should not promote religious activities in public education.

- **Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971)**: The Court established the Lemon Test, evaluating whether governmental action violates the Establishment Clause based on its secular legislative purpose, its effect on religion, and whether it fosters excessive government entanglement with religion.

- Subsequent cases, such as *Greece v. Galloway* (2014), have continued to address the nuanced relationship between religious expressions in public spaces and the boundaries of government endorsement of religion.

More recent cases, including *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021)*, have scrutinized policies regarding religious organizations involved in public services, indicating an ongoing dialogue about the implications of religious freedom in modern governance.

Throughout history, the struggle for the separation of church and state has reflected broader societal conflicts regarding religious freedom, moral values, and civic responsibility, often intensifying during periods of political upheaval.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The concept of church-state separation is not static and must adapt to cultural changes and legal challenges. Modern discussions around church-state relations often revolve around education funding, religious displays in public spaces, and the implications of religious beliefs on social services. The ongoing interpretation of these principles continues to shape American legal and cultural landscapes.
