### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Research into the economic, social, and health implications of marijuana legalization reveals that it significantly boosts the economy through tax revenues, creates jobs, shifts social dynamics, and has both positive and negative health outcomes.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Economic Implications:**  
- The U.S. cannabis industry is projected to generate up to $130 billion annually by 2024. In 2018, the industry already made $46.2 billion, with states like California contributing significantly to tax revenues. 
- For every $1 spent in the marijuana industry, $2.13 to $2.40 in economic activity is generated. The marijuana industry is expected to exceed $24 billion in revenue by 2025. Various industries, including tourism, real estate, and food service, benefit from legalization.  
- Jobs related to the cannabis industry are rapidly increasing, providing opportunities for various sectors. Economic studies estimate significant job creation in areas surrounding the industry.

**Social Implications:**  
- Legalization has raised discussions on social equity and criminal justice. There is a movement toward rectifying past injustices related to marijuana prohibition, ensuring that those disproportionately affected by previous laws can benefit from legalization efforts. 
- Public perception of marijuana is changing, leading to more acceptance among different demographics, which in turn has implications for public policy and individual behaviors surrounding drug use.
- However, some argue that legalization could lead to increased social issues, including substance abuse and the potential normalization of drug use among youth and vulnerable populations. 

**Health Implications:**  
- Studies indicate both benefits and risks. Proponents of legalization argue that it can reduce opioid abuse and related deaths. Legal marijuana may offer pain relief and reduce reliance on more harmful substances. 
- Conversely, critics warn of potential public health concerns, including increased usage rates and possible negative consequences on mental health, cannabis dependency, and relation to other substance abuses. The complexity of the relationship between marijuana legalization and public health outcomes necessitates a thorough review of ongoing medical research.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
While the topic remains contentious, the wider societal debates surrounding marijuana legalization encompass economic benefits that states may enjoy, complex social considerations, and a growing body of health research. Ongoing studies continue to analyze its multifaceted impacts.
