### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Children cope with divorce through various strategies and mechanisms. Parental support and stability are crucial for helping them navigate the emotional and psychological challenges during this difficult time.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Divorce affects nearly half of children in the U.S., leading to a complex emotional landscape where they may experience confusion, sadness, anger, and feelings of guilt. Academic studies highlight key strategies that can help children better cope with divorce:

1. **Coping Efficacy**: Research indicates that a child's belief in their ability to cope (coping efficacy) significantly influences their psychological outcomes. Children who believe they can manage their emotions often fare better.

2. **Open Communication**: It's vital for both parents to communicate openly with their children about the divorce, addressing any fears or misconceptions they may have. This helps to minimize confusion and offers a sense of stability.

3. **Emotional Support**: Providing reassurance, stability, and emotional support can ease children's anxiety. Parents should strive to maintain a peaceful environment and avoid exposing children to conflicts.

4. **Positive Relationships**: Encouraging a positive relationship with both parents is essential. When children feel free to love both parents without the burden of loyalty conflicts, they are more likely to adjust positively to divorce.

5. **Research Findings**: A study by Sandler et al. indicated that active coping strategies and avoidance coping both play roles in children's psychological adjustment. Effective coping mechanisms can prevent the onset of psychological problems.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Parents can help children cope by providing structured support. This includes creating a consistent routine, involving children in decisions that concern them, and modeling healthy emotional expressions. Moreover, the resilience demonstrated by many children showcases their ability to adapt when given the right tools and support.
