### 1. Task outcome (short version):
As of 2023, specific statistics for the percentage of women who identify as pro-choice are not readily available. However, historical polling indicates that approximately 60% of women have traditionally identified as pro-choice, consistent with broader national sentiments.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
A historical perspective shows that in a 2019 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, about 57% of Americans expressed pro-choice views, with women's support usually aligning with this number. Similar polls over the years have maintained that approximately 60% of women across various demographics support abortion rights. Further analysis reveals that support tends to be higher amongst women affiliated with the Democratic party.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Factors influencing these statistics include political affiliation, differences in educational background, and regional variations. For instance, younger and more educated women tend to have higher pro-choice identification rates. Continuous monitoring through organizations like the Guttmacher Institute will be essential as public sentiments can shift based on recent legal and political developments surrounding abortion rights.

In conclusion, while it is difficult to pin down an exact percentage for 2023, the overarching trend illustrates a strong pro-choice inclination among women, with historical data suggesting consistent support reflecting broader national attitudes.
