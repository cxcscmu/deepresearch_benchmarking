### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Hinduism, considered one of the world's oldest religions, originates from the merging of the Indus Valley Civilization and Aryan culture, with significant foundations established in the Vedic texts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Hinduism, often termed the oldest religion in the world, has a complex history that is closely linked to the cultural practices of the Indigenous peoples of the Indian subcontinent. The historical origins of Hinduism can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), which thrived between 2500 and 1500 B.C.E. in what is now northwest India and eastern Pakistan. The IVC featured religious practices that were likely polytheistic, as suggested by various seals and figurines uncovered in archaeological sites, depicting horned deities and animals that are reminiscent of later Hindu gods.

Following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, the arrival of Indo-Aryans around 1500 B.C.E. marked a significant cultural shift. The Vedic period ushered in the compilation of the Vedic texts, namely the Rig Veda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. These texts, believed to embody eternal knowledge, contain hymns that discuss cosmology, rituals, and prayer. The Vedas emphasize concepts such as dharma (duty), karma (action), and samsara (cycle of life), which continue to play a vital role in Hindu philosophy.

Despite the influence of the Vedic texts, the precise details of religious practices in the Indus Valley remain largely speculative due to the undeciphered script. However, elements such as ritual bathing and animal sacrifice documented in the archaeological findings indicate an early form of ritualistic worship that likely fed into the Vedic traditions.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The origins of Hinduism are characterized by a synthesis of diverse religious practices and philosophies over millennia, heavily influenced by both the indigenous religious traditions of the IVC and the literary, spiritual, and social frameworks brought in by Indo-Aryans. The continuing evolution of Hinduism has been shaped by varying cultural influences throughout Indian history, making it a dynamic and rich religious tradition.
