### 1. Historical Instances of Doctrinal Changes by Popes:

- **Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241)**: Credited for consolidating church laws and the establishment of canon law, his actions marked a turning point in addressing heresies and improving doctrinal consistency.
  
- **Pope Pius IX (1846-1878)**: Known for issuing the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, he condemned modernism and liberalism, emphasizing the church's authority on moral issues.
  
- **Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903)**: His encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891) brought about changes by engaging social questions, advocating social justice, and marking a shift in doctrine towards the recognition of social issues.

- **Pope John XXIII (1958-1963)**: Initiated the Second Vatican Council that produced significant reforms in church doctrine and liturgy, promoting ecumenism.

- **Pope Francis (2013-present)**: Known for addressing contemporary moral issues through a pastoral lens, such as issues relating to divorce and same-sex marriage, while not formally changing dogma.

### 2. Canonical Processes for Changing Doctrine:

- **Listening and Consultation**: Engaging with the community and scripture, exemplified by biblical deliberations, especially in Acts 15.
  
- **Council Decisions**: Historical councils like Vatican II have employed collective discussion to ensure balance between tradition and contemporary understanding.
  
- **Canonical Procedures**: Codified in the Code of Canon Law, these provide formal frameworks for maintaining doctrinal integrity through administrative recourse and adjustments.
  
- **Implementation and Adjustment**: Churches adjust practices in response to doctrinal decisions to align with the realities of faith experiences.

### 3. Additional Context:

Understanding that the church's doctrinal evolution is often about adapting to community needs rather than complete transformations, where core beliefs remain stable while procedures may evolve.
