### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The 1920s was a transformative decade for civil liberties in the United States, marked by significant social movements, legislative changes, and influential figures such as women’s suffrage advocates and civil rights activists.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In the 1920s, several events and movements significantly influenced the protection of civil liberties in the United States. 

- **Social Movements:**  
  - **Women’s suffrage movement**: The 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, reflecting a monumental shift in civil rights and liberties, representing a long-fought battle by figures like Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul.
  - **Labor movements**: The decade saw growing labor unrest, with strikes and protests advocating for workers' rights, such as the 1920 Steel Strike, which highlighted the ongoing struggle for fair wages and conditions. 
  - **The Harlem Renaissance**: A cultural movement celebrating African American culture, it also served as a platform for civil rights advocacy, with figures like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston pushing for racial equality.
  - **The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Founded in 1920, the ACLU became a crucial player in legal battles for civil rights, defending individuals against government oppression.

- **Significant Legislation:**  
  - **The National Origins Act of 1924**: This legislation imposed strict quotas on immigration, significantly affecting minority communities and civil liberties of those seeking to enter the country.
  - **The Volstead Act (1919)**: Although it predates the 1920s, its enforcement marked the beginning of Prohibition, impacting civil liberties by enforcing prohibition laws that were often ignored or resisted, leading to the rise of speakeasies and organized crime.
  - **The Espionage Act (1917)** and **Sedition Act (1918)**: These acts limited free speech and led to the prosecution of dissenters during and after World War I, setting a worrying precedent for civil liberties during the 1920s.

- **Key Figures:**  
  - **Roger Baldwin**: Co-founder of the ACLU, he fought tirelessly for civil liberties throughout the decade.
  - **Alice Paul**: A prominent suffragist who played a crucial role in advocating for women’s rights.
  - **W. E. B. Du Bois**: An influential figure in the fight for African American rights and the founder of the NAACP, he often spoke on civil liberties issues during the Harlem Renaissance.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The 1920s was characterized by a complex interplay between social progress and repression. While there were significant strides towards greater civil liberties via movements like women’s suffrage and labor rights, there were also considerable setbacks due to restrictive immigration laws, Prohibition, and repressive legislation like the Espionage and Sedition Acts. Understanding this decade is crucial for grasping the historical context of civil liberties in the U.S.
