### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Standard police investigative techniques include evidence collection, interviews, crime scene analysis, and forensic investigations.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **Evidence Collection:** This is a fundamental aspect of any investigation. Officers collect physical, photographic, and documentary evidence from the crime scene. This might include fingerprints, DNA, bullets, and digital records. The goal is to preserve and document evidence to ensure it can be analyzed later in a lab setting.

- **Interviews and Interrogations:** Law enforcement interviews witnesses, victims, and, potentially, suspects. The aim is to gather information about the crime and understand different perspectives. Interrogations are more structured sessions focusing on obtaining confessions or more detailed information from suspects.

- **Crime Scene Analysis:** This includes securing the crime scene to prevent contamination and determining the layout and elements of the scene. Investigators will analyze blood spatter patterns, the placement of items, and any signs of struggle or forced entry. 

- **Forensic Analysis:** Police work closely with forensic specialists to analyze evidence. This can involve everything from ballistics (examining bullets) to toxicology (analyzing bodily fluids). Forensic evidence often plays a critical role in establishing guilt or innocence.

- **Surveillance and Stakeouts:** Often used in cases involving drug trafficking or organized crime, officers may conduct surveillance to gather intelligence. This can include the use of cameras, listening devices, and undercover operations.

- **Use of Technology:** Modern investigations utilize technology extensively. Crime mapping software helps in analyzing patterns of crime, while databases contain information on criminal records, fingerprints, and DNA.

- **Collaboration and Networking:** Effective investigations often require collaboration with other agencies, including federal, state, and local law enforcement, and sometimes private sector entities to build comprehensive evidence.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Investigative techniques are continuously evolving due to advancements in technology and changes in crime trends. Awareness of community issues and ongoing training helps police adapt methods to be more effective in solving crimes.
