1. **Higher Education**:
   - Provides substantial benefits, such as increased employability and potential earnings (approximately $1.2 million more over a lifetime for bachelor's degree holders).
   - Current job satisfaction among faculty is at 84%, but overall satisfaction has decreased by 27% in the last five years, especially among administrative staff.
   - Graduates often face challenges related to underemployment and high student debt.

2. **Vocational Training and Apprenticeships**:
   - Offers a practical and economically viable alternative, with 87% satisfaction among skilled trade workers.
   - Approximately 91% of apprentices secure jobs within their fields post-training, with starting salaries upwards of $77,000.
   - High job satisfaction attributed to competitive pay, stability, and clear career advancement opportunities.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - While higher education presents significant benefits particularly in terms of earning potential, the associated costs and job satisfaction concerns challenge its universal suitability for everyone.
   - Vocational training provides a practical, lower-cost pathway to stable employment with high satisfaction, potentially more suited for those seeking immediate job readiness without incurring large debts.

Thus, the question "can everyone benefit from higher education?" can be answered as follows: While higher education has its benefits in terms of earnings and opportunities, vocational training and apprenticeships also offer substantial advantages, particularly regarding job satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, indicating that not everyone may benefit equally from traditional higher education settings.
