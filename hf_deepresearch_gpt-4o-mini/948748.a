### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Adult children may stop talking to their parents due to a variety of emotional and psychological reasons, including lack of empathy, unresolved conflicts, abusive experiences during childhood, or differing values that create insurmountable tensions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The phenomenon of adult child-parent estrangement is complex, encompassing a range of emotional, psychological, and situational factors that affect familial relationships. Research from various articles highlights multiple reasons adult children may cease communication with their parents:

- **Abuse and Neglect:** Many adult children cite experiences of emotional, physical, or psychological abuse in childhood as fundamental reasons for estrangement. In cases where a parent displays unresolved trauma or abusive behavior, adult children may feel compelled to disconnect to protect their mental health.

- **Unmet Emotional Needs:** Estrangement often occurs when children feel their emotional needs are not acknowledged or met by their parents. Adults may distance themselves to alleviate emotional pain or disappointment caused by their parents' inability or unwillingness to provide support or understanding.

- **Differences in Values and Beliefs:** Adult children may also stop communicating with their parents due to significant differences in personal beliefs or values that lead to conflict. These differences can create a lack of mutual respect and understanding, ultimately resulting in estrangement.

- **Situational Triggers:** Key life events, such as a parent's illness or psychological decline, can increase tensions and may lead adult children to reassess their relationships. They might feel overwhelmed or incapable of providing the support that is expected, leading to a breakdown in communication.

- **Temporary vs. Permanent Estrangement:** It's important to note that while some estrangements can be permanent, many are temporary and may resolve over time as individuals address and work through underlying issues.

Statistical insights indicate that up to 4% of adults may actively report estrangement from one or both parents, showcasing that this issue is not uncommon.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the dynamics of adult children's relationships with their parents is vital for providing supportive resources. Interventions and therapeutic approaches focusing on empathy, understanding, and open communication can play significant roles in mending estranged relationships.
