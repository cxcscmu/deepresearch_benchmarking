### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The research indicates that extrinsic motivation significantly influences athletic performance with both positive and negative effects. It can enhance performance but may also lead to anxiety and burnout if improperly managed.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The synthesis of literature reveals a complex relationship between extrinsic motivation and athletic performance, characterized by both beneficial and detrimental effects:

- **Positive Impacts**: Extrinsic motivation can significantly enhance performance by leveraging external rewards (e.g., trophies, praise) that encourage athletes to strive for improvement. Particularly for younger athletes, the influence of coaches and parents is paramount; for example, verbal reinforcement from coaches can correlate positively with athletes' motivation and performance improvements. Studies have noted instances where reward systems in collegiate sports boosted motivation and performance fulfillment.

- **Negative Impacts**: However, excessive reliance on extrinsic motivation can lead to increased pressure and performance anxiety, resulting in burnout and reduced enjoyment in the sport. The literature emphasizes that social comparisons and the pursuit of approval from peers may contribute to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in high-performance contexts.

- **Age and Motivation Types**: The effects are more pronounced among younger athletes, while older athletes may develop intrinsic motivation that overshadows extrinsic incentives. The article suggests a balanced approach is necessary; while extrinsic rewards can drive performance, they should be complemented by intrinsic motivation to sustain long-term engagement.

- **Influence of Coaches and Parents**: Both coaches and parents are crucial in shaping the motivational environment for athletes. Coaching styles, whether supportive or aggressive, profoundly impact the levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and, by extension, overall performance.

In summary, effective use of extrinsic motivational elements can improve athletic performance, provided they are balanced to avoid the pitfalls associated with high-pressure environments.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The document is a master's thesis that integrates various studies to elucidate the relationship between different motivational types (extrinsic, intrinsic) in sports contexts. It serves as a valuable resource for coaches, educators, and parents, aiming to foster a positive motivational climate that maximizes athletic performance while minimizing risks associated with externally imposed pressures.
