### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The rise of the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945 led to the Holocaust, a horrific event that saw the systematic genocide of six million Jews and millions of others deemed undesirable.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The history of the Holocaust and the rise of the Nazi regime can be summarized in several key points:
- **1933:** Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany, initiating a series of policies aimed at consolidating power and promoting Nazi ideology.
- **1935:** The Nuremberg Laws are enacted, stripping Jews of German citizenship and prohibiting marriages between Jews and non-Jews, laying the groundwork for systemic discrimination.
- **1938:** Kristallnacht occurs, a coordinated attack on Jewish institutions and businesses, marking a significant escalation in anti-Semitic violence.
- **1941:** The systematic extermination of Jews escalates with the implementation of the Final Solution, leading to mass deportations and the establishment of extermination camps.
- **1945:** The end of World War II results in the liberation of concentration camps, revealing the full extent of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.
The period from 1933 to 1945 highlights the complexities of the Nazi regime's rise to power and the subsequent execution of policies that led to one of history's darkest chapters.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The International response during the Nazi regime varied, with little action taken to prevent the escalating violence against Jews until the war's end. The legacy of the Holocaust continues to serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance.
