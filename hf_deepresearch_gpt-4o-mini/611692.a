### 4. Influence of Practical Intelligence on Authentic Leadership
Practical intelligence complements emotional and cognitive intelligence by equipping leaders with the skills needed to implement their knowledge in real-life situations. It involves common sense, social competence, and the ability to navigate everyday challenges effectively. Practical intelligence enables authentic leaders to make grounded decisions and adapt to changing environments, ensuring that their leadership style remains relevant and effective.

### 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, emotional, cognitive, and practical intelligence collectively enhance authentic leadership by fostering effective communication, sound decision-making, and adaptive strategies. Leaders who cultivate these intelligences are better positioned to create inclusive and thriving work environments that promote growth and innovation.
