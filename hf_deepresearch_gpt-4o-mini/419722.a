### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Wealthy individuals utilize various strategies to avoid taxes, including maintaining low salaries, leveraging financial assets as loans, utilizing tax deductions through charitable contributions, and sophisticated estate planning techniques like the "buy, borrow, die" method.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Billionaires and wealthy individuals employ several key strategies to minimize their tax liabilities. These strategies often exploit loopholes and features within the tax system that are less accessible to average earners:
- **Low Salaries and Stock Options**: Many billionaires report low salaries while receiving significant earnings through stock options. This means they defer taxes until they sell their stocks, avoiding immediate taxation on high salaries.

- **Leverage Stocks for Loans**: Wealthy individuals can borrow against their stocks instead of selling them. This allows them to access capital without realizing capital gains, thereby avoiding taxes at the time of borrowing.

- **Estate Planning**: Wealthy families utilize strategies that involve passing wealth to heirs without incurring significant capital gains taxes. The "buy, borrow, die" strategy means they buy assets, borrow against them during their lifetime, and allow the assets to pass on to their heirs at a stepped-up basis at death, avoiding taxes on the appreciation that occurred during their lifetimes.

- **Charitable Contributions**: By donating to charities, billionaires can claim tax deductions, significantly lowering their taxable income while improving their public image.

- **Classifying Personal Expenses as Business Deductions**: Many wealthy individuals creatively classify personal expenses (like luxury travel) as business expenses to take advantage of tax deductions.

These methods ultimately allow billionaires to pay a lower effective tax rate compared to average income earners, contributing to growing wealth inequality.

### 3. Additional context:
In recent discussions and analyses, it has been shown that tax avoidance strategies negatively affect tax policy and contribute to social disparities. This has triggered debates on necessary tax reforms to close these loopholes and ensure fair taxation for all. The sources consulted include reputable articles from ProPublica and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, which highlight different facets of these strategies and their implications on societal equity.
