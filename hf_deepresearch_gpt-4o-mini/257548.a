### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The process of obtaining United States citizenship for immigrants involves various steps including eligibility assessment, completing the application, attending interviews, and passing required tests.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The United States citizenship process for immigrants is a multi-step procedure managed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Here are the detailed steps:
1. **Determine Eligibility:** Applicants must meet certain eligibility criteria, such as being a lawful permanent resident for a specific period, demonstrating good moral character, and having basic U.S. history and government knowledge.
2. **Complete Application Form:** Eligible individuals must fill out Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. 
3. **Submit Application:** The completed application along with required documents and fees is submitted to USCIS. Fees can vary but typically are around $725, including the biometrics fee.
4. **Biometrics Appointment:** Once the application is accepted, applicants are scheduled for a biometrics appointment to provide fingerprints and take photographs.
5. **Interview:** After biometrics, an interview will be scheduled where applicants will answer questions about their application, background, and take a civics and English test.
6. **Receive a Decision:** USCIS will provide a decision on the application. If approved, applicants receive further instructions.
7. **Oath of Allegiance:** The final step is to attend a naturalization ceremony where applicants take the Oath of Allegiance, officially becoming U.S. citizens.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
It's essential for applicants to check the USCIS website or consult with legal experts for the most current information on eligibility requirements, forms, fees, and processing times, as these can change frequently. Processing times can vary widely based on location and other factors, typically ranging from several months to a few years.
