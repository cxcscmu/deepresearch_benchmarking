### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Age of Exploration, spanning from the late 15th century to the 17th century, began due to intertwined motivationsâ€”economic, political, and technological.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Age of Exploration was driven by various factors:

**Economic Motivations:**
- **Quest for New Trade Routes:** European nations sought alternatives to traditional routes dominated by the Ottoman Empire to access spices and luxury goods more directly, exemplified by Vasco da Gama's maritime route to India and Columbus's discovery of the Americas.
- **Wealth from Natural Resources:** New territories offered immense riches, notably gold and silver from the New World, stimulating European economies and financing further explorations.
- **Mercantilism and Colonization:** The economic doctrine of mercantilism emphasized maximizing wealth through colonies, supplying essential resources, while simultaneously providing markets for European goods.
- **Competition among European Powers:** Rivalry among nations like Spain, Portugal, England, and France spurred investments in expeditions to gain territorial and trade advantages.
- **Emergence of Joint-Stock Companies:** These entities allowed collective investment in exploratory voyages, promoting extensive and ambitious explorations.

**Political Motivations:**
- **National Prestige:** European monarchs sought the expansion of their empires, using exploration to assert power and enhance national prestige.
- **Competing Colonial Interests:** Initial efforts by Spain and Portugal prompted efforts from England and France, igniting geopolitical conflicts over newly claimed territories.
- **Religious Motivations:** There were also efforts to spread Christianity, with missions aimed at converting indigenous peoples and countering rival religious factions.

**Technological Innovations:**
- **Ship Design:** Advances like the caravel and galleon enabled longer and safer voyages, enhancing trade capabilities.
- **Navigational Tools:** Instruments such as the magnetic compass and astrolabe improved sea navigation, helping explorers chart their courses more accurately.
- **Cartography:** The development of more precise maps was crucial in facilitating exploration and trade.
- **Chronometers:** Innovations like the marine chronometer allowed for accurate longitude measurements, improving travel safety.
- **Navigation Techniques:** Techniques such as dead reckoning and celestial navigation were refined, reducing the risks associated with lengthy sea voyages.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Age of Exploration was characterized by complex interrelations of economic, political, and technological motivations. These drivers worked in concert, propelling European nations into a period of aggressive territorial expansion, radically altering global interactions and leading to profound cultural exchanges.
