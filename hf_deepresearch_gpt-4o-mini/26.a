### 1. Task Outcome (Short Version)
Despite attempts, I was unable to retrieve detailed academic studies or current surveys on the psychological motivations behind cheating in sports due to system limitations.

### 2. Task Outcome (Extremely Detailed Version)
The gathered information reveals that cheating in sports can occur due to various psychological motivations, including pressure to win, social influences, and a desire for recognition. However, I could not access specific studies that delve into these motivations. The historical context of cheating has shown significant implications for both athletes and organizations.

### 3. Additional Context (Recommendations)
To gain deeper insights into the psychological factors influencing cheating in sports, I recommend the following approaches:
- Explore academic databases directly, such as Google Scholar, JSTOR, or PsycINFO, searching with terms like "psychological motivations for cheating in sports."
- Look for literature reviews or meta-analyses that summarize findings on this topic.
- Reach out to university libraries for access to resources focused on sports psychology.
- Follow up with sports organizations' research publications for statistical data and qualitative insights.

In summary, while the system's limitations restricted access to specific studies, existing knowledge indicates that motivations behind cheating are complex and multifaceted, warranting further investigation.
