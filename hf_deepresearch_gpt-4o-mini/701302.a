## Summary Report on the Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict

### 1. Historical Context
The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict primarily revolves around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians. 

- **Soviet Era Roots:** The tensions began during the final years of the Soviet Union, with the region declaring independence in 1988. This led to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994), resulting in approximately 30,000 casualties and the establishment of de facto Armenian control over the region by 1994 through a ceasefire.

- **Post-War Tensions:** Despite a ceasefire, the status of Nagorno-Karabakh remained unresolved, leading to intermittent clashes and heightened national sentiments.

- **The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020):** A significant resurgence in violence occurred in September 2020, when Azerbaijan launched an offensive to reclaim territories, resulting in significant territorial gains and reshaping the power dynamics in the region.

### 2. Recent Developments (2022-2023)
- From December 2022, Azerbaijan blockaded the Lachin corridor, impacting the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh. This blockade was a precursor to a large-scale offensive.

- **The 2023 Offensive:** On September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan initiated a military operation that rapidly overwhelmed Armenian defenses in Nagorno-Karabakh. This operation led to a significant humanitarian crisis, with many ethnic Armenians fleeing the region.

- **Aftermath:** The self-declared Republic of Artsakh was officially dissolved as of January 1, 2024, with over 100,000 refugees fleeing to Armenia, reflecting the stark humanitarian impacts of the conflict.

### 3. Implications of the Conflict
The situation reflects long-standing grievances and territorial disputes influenced by nationalism and regional geopolitics, particularly with the involvement of neighbors such as Turkey and Russia. The continuity of these tensions poses challenges for any prospective peace efforts and addresses humanitarian needs arising from the conflict.
