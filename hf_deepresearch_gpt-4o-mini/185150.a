### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current measures and tools for climate change prevention include international agreements, national policies, and various technological innovations. Notable sources like the UNFCCC and IPCC provide frameworks and guidelines for these measures.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **International Agreements**: Key initiatives such as the Paris Agreement seek to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Countries commit to setting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

- **National Policies**: Numerous countries have engaged in formulating policies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and enhancing climate resilience. These include carbon pricing, renewable energy mandates, and improved energy efficiency standards.

- **Technological Tools**: Innovative technologies such as renewable energy solutions (solar, wind), carbon capture and storage, and energy-efficient building practices help mitigate climate impacts.

- **Financial Mechanisms**: Climate finance mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund, support developing countries in implementing sustainable development projects aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation.

- **Forestry and Land Use**: Initiatives aimed at reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable land management are critical in mitigating emissions from land-use change.

- **Adaptation Strategies**: Tools focusing on adaptation strategies, including infrastructure improvements to withstand climate impacts (e.g., flood defenses, drought-resistant crops), help communities adapt to changing climates.

Sources like the UNFCCC provide numerous resources and documents that outline these measures and tools, while the IPCC regularly publishes assessment reports detailing the effectiveness and urgency of implemented strategies.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The effectiveness of these measures often depends on concerted global action, multilateral cooperation, and the commitment of both government and private sectors to address climate change comprehensively.
