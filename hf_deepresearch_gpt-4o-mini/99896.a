### 1. Task outcome (short version):
We expect more from technology than interpersonal relationships primarily due to the immediacy and reliability that technology offers, contrasting with the complexity and emotional demands of human interactions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The expectation gap between technology and interpersonal relationships can be analyzed from psychological, sociological, and cultural perspectives. 

- **Psychological Factors:** People often gravitate towards technology for its predictability and ease of use. Unlike interpersonal relationships, which require emotional investment, effort, and risk, technology provides instant solutions and gratification. This leads to a reliance on devices or platforms to meet social needs. For example, social media can offer quick social validation, reducing the necessity for more complex interpersonal interactions.

- **Sociological Aspects:** Modern society has increasingly integrated technology into daily life, leading to a transformation in communication and social norms. With the rise of digital communication tools, the dynamics of how relationships form and are maintained have shifted. People may prioritize tech interactions because they are readily available and easier to navigate, especially for those who struggle with face-to-face interactions.

- **Cultural Changes:** The values of convenience and efficiency in contemporary culture reinforce the expectation that technology will deliver faster, more efficient results compared to the messy, unpredictable nature of human relationships. 

Overall, as technology continues to evolve, the perception of it becoming more reliable and satisfactory as a source of interaction may lead to diminished expectations from face-to-face relationships.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The evolution of social media, smartphones, and instant communication technologies has radically altered how individuals connect with one another, facilitating a culture that favors rapid, low-effort interactions over the deeper engagement typically required for meaningful relationships.
