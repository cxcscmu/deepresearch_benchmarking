This information often portrays ivermectin as a miracle cure against COVID-19, leading many to seek it out without understanding the lack of supportive scientific evidence.
- **Distrust in Traditional Medicine**: Some individuals are skeptical of the traditional healthcare system, especially regarding vaccinations and established treatment protocols. This distrust results in a search for alternative treatments, which are often perceived as more natural or less controlled by pharmaceutical companies.
- **Anecdotal Evidence**: Personal testimonials from individuals claiming success with ivermectin have gained traction, further fueling its popularity despite the absence of robust clinical data to support such claims.
