### 1. Task outcome (short version):

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Adolf Hitler's dictatorship in Germany began officially on January 30, 1933, when he was appointed Chancellor. He solidified his control of the country by passing the Enabling Act in March 1933, which allowed him to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag (the German parliament). This effectively gave him dictatorial powers. 

His rule is marked by the establishment of a totalitarian regime based on fascism and anti-Semitism, leading to World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler's regime continued until his death on April 30, 1945, as Soviet forces were closing in on Berlin towards the end of the war. His death marked the collapse of the Nazi government, and Germany officially surrendered on May 8, 1945, leading to the end of his dictatorship.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Hitler's dictatorship is one of the most notorious periods in modern history, characterized by aggressive expansionism, widespread human rights abuses, and the devastation of World War II. His rule had profound impacts on Germany and the world, leading to significant changes in international relations and the global landscape.
