### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Human activities, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions, are unequivocally responsible for global warming and climate change. The report emphasizes that these emissions arise from unsustainable energy use, land-use changes, and consumption patterns, with significant contributions from industrialized nations and a disproportionate effect on vulnerable populations.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The report highlights that human activities have unequivocally caused global warming, with a global temperature increase of approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) observed between 2011 and 2020. Specific points include:
- Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen consistently, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, contributing over 59 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2019 — marking a significant increase over previous decades.
- Emissions are not only unequal across nations; they are also highly concentrated within population segments, such that the richest households account for a significant portion of total emissions (34-45%), while many of the poorest contribute minimally (13-15%).
- The disproportionate effects of climate change are evident, with vulnerable communities—those contributing least to the problem—suffering the most from climate-related risks and impacts. These communities include low-income households, small-scale farmers, and indigenous peoples.
- The report outlines how human-caused climate change has significantly exacerbated weather extremes, leading to widespread adverse impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, human health, and overall well-being. Increases in climate-related disorders and mortality rates are noted, particularly in high-risk regions.
- Climate change's impacts are further escalated as it drives economic damages, declines in biodiversity, and increased food insecurity, showcasing an interconnected threat to human systems and natural ecosystems.
- Historical data shows that cumulative net CO2 emissions from human activities since 1850 predominantly influenced atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, establishing a clear connection between human behavior and climate change impacts.

### 3. Additional context:
This summary is derived from the 2023 Synthesis Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which consolidates the findings from multiple working groups. The document discusses current climate change status, future predictions, and identifies effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. A critical aspect of the report is reinforcing the notion that human activities are at the core of climate change, necessitating urgent and extensive global action. The report serves to inform policymakers and motivate action towards reducing GHG emissions, enhancing adaptation measures, and ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive support in the face of climate disruptions.
