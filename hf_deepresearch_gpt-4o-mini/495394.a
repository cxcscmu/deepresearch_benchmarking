Charles Dickens presents poverty prominently in several of his works, including 'Oliver Twist,' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' 'David Copperfield,' 'Hard Times,' and 'Little Dorrit.' Each of these novels reveals stark social critiques of the poverty and inequalities in 19th-century England, shaped by the industrial revolution and the Poor Laws. Dickens's narrative style humanizes the struggles of the impoverished, advocating for empathy and systemic reform while emphasizing the moral complexities surrounding poverty. These themes have had a lasting impact on literature and social consciousness.
