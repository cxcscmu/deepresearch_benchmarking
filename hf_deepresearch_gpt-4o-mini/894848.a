### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Due to technical limitations, I was unable to retrieve specific scholarly articles or historical texts on Viking attacks in East Francia and England.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Despite multiple attempts to gather information regarding Viking attacks in East Francia and England, focusing on military responses, significant events, and cultural impacts, all efforts to perform web searches for relevant articles were met with an error related to insufficient credits. This restricted my ability to access the data necessary to provide a thorough response. As a result, comprehensive findings regarding military strategies employed during Viking invasions, notable events such as individual raids or battles, and the cultural ramifications of these incursions remain inaccessible at this time. Without detailed academic resources or historical texts, I cannot fulfill the detailed aspect of this task as requested.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Given the continuous access issues and inability to retrieve critical information via web searches, it may be advisable to consult established historical encyclopedias, university databases, or library resources for scholarly articles on Viking history and their impacts on East Francia and England. Texts such as "The Viking World" by James Graham-Campbell and historical analyses from journals dedicated to medieval studies may also provide valuable insights.
