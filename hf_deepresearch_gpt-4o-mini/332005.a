#### 1. Processes for Handling Discrepancies
Standard practices for handling discrepancies in trust accounting include:

1. **Regular Reconciliation**: Trust accounts should be reconciled regularly (monthly or quarterly) with bank statements to identify discrepancies early.
2. **Immediate Investigation**: Upon identifying a discrepancy, whether it's a balance issue or an unusual transaction, it should be investigated immediately to determine the cause and address any potential issues.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough records of all transactions and communications related to trust accounts. This includes account statements, receipts, and correspondence with clients.
4. **Clear Client Communication**: If discrepancies affect clients, communicate with them promptly to explain the situation and actions being taken. Transparency helps build trust and facilitates resolution.
5. **Adhere to Legal and Ethical Standards**: Compliance with regulatory requirements regarding trust accounts is crucial, including understanding jurisdiction-specific laws.
