   - The Civil War catalyzed significant changes in women's roles, as they took on responsibilities traditionally held by men, which revealed their capabilities and spurred advocacy for rights including suffrage.

4. **Demographic Shifts**: 
   - Women outnumbered men in many areas, leading them to redefine their identities and seek more fulfilling roles outside of domestic spheres, ultimately fueling their engagement in reform.

5. **Self-Expression and Fashion Changes**: 
   - Evolving fashion mirrored a growing desire for autonomy among women, empowering them to seek rights and embrace reform efforts.

6. **Moral and Religious Imperatives**:
