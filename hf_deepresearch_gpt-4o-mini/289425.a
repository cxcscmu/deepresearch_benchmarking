### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The failure of Reconstruction in the United States was primarily due to a combination of political violence, economic exploitation, and systemic social racism. Key factors included the rise of white supremacist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the inadequate handling of land reform policies, economic challenges such as taxation and a lack of resources, as well as the implementation of discriminatory laws like Black Codes and Jim Crow laws.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) aimed to reintegrate the Southern states into the Union and rebuild the war-torn country while also addressing the rights and social integration of formerly enslaved African Americans. However, several intertwined factors led to its failure:

**Political Obstacles:**  
- **Violence and Intimidation:** White supremacist groups, most notably the Ku Klux Klan, used violence and intimidation to suppress Black political power and maintain the racial status quo. 
- **Federal Policy Failures:** While the federal government attempted various policies to assist freed African Americans, these were frequently undermined or poorly implemented. For example, the Freedmen's Bureau was initially effective but lost support and funding over time.

**Economic Obstacles:**  
- **Poor Economic Conditions:** The Southern economy was devastated after the Civil War, leading to widespread poverty. The implementation of high taxes to fund Reconstruction caused further hardship for impoverished Southern families.
- **Land Reform Failures:** Initial plans for land redistribution, such as Sherman's Special Field Order No. 15, which promised 'Forty Acres and a Mule' to freed families, were largely abandoned. Instead, many African Americans were forced into sharecropping arrangements, which kept them in cycles of debt and poverty while mainly benefiting white landowners.

**Social Obstacles:**  
- **Implementation of Black Codes:** These laws enacted by Southern states severely restricted the freedoms of African Americans, forcing them into exploitative labor conditions and limiting their rights to vote and participate in governance.
- **Rise of Jim Crow Laws:** By the late 19th century, discriminatory laws institutionalizing racial segregation were enacted across the South, further entrenching systemic racism and reducing the gains made during Reconstruction.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Reconstruction's failure to secure rights and protections for African Americans has had a long-lasting impact on American society, influencing racial dynamics up to the present day. The lack of substantive changes during this period set a precedent for the systemic racism, economic inequality, and social injustice that would persist in the following decades.
