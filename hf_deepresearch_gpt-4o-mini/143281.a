### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The cognitive development of children occurs in a series of milestones that influence their ability to form opinions, with significant changes in cognitive abilities happening from infancy through early childhood.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Child cognitive development is typically categorized into various stages, each associated with distinct milestones. These milestones not only involve motor skills but also cognitive abilities, including the capacity to form opinions and understand various viewpoints.

- From **0-2 years**: Children develop basic understanding through sensory and motor interactions with the world. They form simple opinions based on their immediate experiences and caregivers' responses. They start recognizing familiar faces and can express emotions.
- At **2-3 years**, children become more expressive about their preferences and opinions, often asserting themselves with phrases like "I want this" or "No!" indicating the beginning of personal choice and opinion formation.
- By **4-5 years**, cognitive skills expand significantly. Children start to understand the concept of perspectives and begin to articulate their opinions more clearly. They engage in pretend play, which reflects their growing capacity to understand different roles and viewpoints.
- Between **6-8 years**, more complex cognitive processes start emerging. Children can hold and express opinions based on logic and reasoning, as they learn to navigate social interactions in school settings. They also become more influenced by peers and cultural norms.
- From **9 years and above**, children's opinions become more nuanced as their critical thinking skills develop. They learn to debate, persuade, and justify their opinions based on more extensive information and experiences.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding child cognitive development is crucial for parents, educators, and psychologists as it helps in fostering environments that support healthy opinion formation. Awareness of these milestones can aid guardians in recognizing when to provide guidance and support in the childâ€™s cognitive journey.
