### 1. Introduction
Slavery in America began in the early 17th century, officially ending with the 13th Amendment in 1865. It was a brutal system that enslaved millions of African individuals, impacting their lives and future generations.

### 2. Historical Timeline
- **1619**: Arrival of the first African slaves in Jamestown, Virginia.
- **1660s-1700s**: Institutionalization of slavery through slave codes.
- **1776**: Ideals of liberty emerge during the American Revolution, yet slavery persists.
- **1865**: The 13th Amendment abolishes slavery in the United States.

### 3. Demographics
Attempts to gather demographic statistics regarding enslaved populations have been unsuccessful due to access restrictions. Key expected data include population sizes, gender ratios, and age distributions that are critical for understanding the socio-economic framework of that era.

### 4. Primary Accounts
Several notable collections of slave narratives exist, particularly from the Federal Writers' Project (1936-1938), which include firsthand accounts of enslaved individuals. These narratives provide profound insights into the personal experiences and struggles of enslaved people.

### 5. Conclusion
The legacy of slavery continues to affect contemporary American society, particularly in discussions surrounding civil rights and racial equity. While access to certain data has been limited in this report, the importance of narratives and the historical context of slavery leave a lasting impact on our cultural understanding.

Recommendation for further study includes reviewing resources at the Library of Congress, state historical societies, and specific archives focused on American and African American history.
