### Why Managers May Act Against Their Ethical Values

#### 1. Introduction
Managers often face situations that challenge their ethical beliefs and values. Despite their personal commitment to ethics, various pressures and circumstances may lead them to make decisions that conflict with these values.

#### 2. Key Factors Influencing Ethical Decision-Making

- **Organizational Culture**: The ingrained practices and expectations in an organization can create an environment where individual ethics are compromised. Managers may feel pressured to conform to the norms of their workplace, even if these contradict their personal beliefs.

- **Pressure to Perform**: In a competitive business environment, the emphasis on achieving targets can drive managers to engage in unethical behavior. The belief that meeting financial goals is paramount may overshadow ethical considerations.

- **Incentives and Rewards**: Many organizations offer incentives that prioritize short-term results over ethical behavior. This creates a conflict for managers who might prioritize their own financial gain or performance evaluations over ethical standards.

- **Lack of Clarity**: When ethical guidelines within an organization are vague or poorly defined, managers may inadvertently act against their ethical values. Without clear standards, individuals can rationalize unethical actions.

#### 3. Conclusion
The factors listed above highlight some of the reasons why managers might choose to act in ways that conflict with their own ethical values. Addressing these issues requires a committed approach to fostering an ethical culture and providing robust ethical guidelines within organizations.

#### 4. Recommendations for Future Research
To gain deeper insights, further investigation into case studies where managers faced ethical dilemmas can provide valuable lessons. Research into methods for encouraging ethical decision-making in management can also be beneficial.
