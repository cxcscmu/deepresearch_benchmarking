### Do Humans Cause Climate Change?

**1. Scientific Consensus:**
The latest IPCC report confirms that human activities are the primary cause of climate change, contributing significantly to the increase in global temperatures (approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels). The evidence highlights that immediate and substantial action is required to mitigate further warming.

**2. Historical Data:**
- Over the last century, global temperatures have risen by about 1°C, with CO2 levels increasing from around 280 ppm to approximately 420 ppm. There is a clear correlation between rising CO2 levels and increasing temperatures.
- The Earth's average surface temperature has increased significantly since the late 19th century, particularly after the mid-20th century.

**3. Causes of Climate Change:**
- **Anthropogenic Factors:**
  - Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and agricultural practices dominate the current climate crisis, accounting for about 76% of total emissions from CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases.
  
- **Natural Factors:**
  - While natural causes (like volcanic eruptions and solar variability) do exist, their contribution to the current rapid climate change is minimal compared to human actions.

**4. Statistics on Greenhouse Gas Contributions:**
- CO2 is responsible for about 64% of the warming effect on the climate.
- Methane contributes approximately 19%, while other greenhouse gases account for the remainder.

**5. Impacts of Climate Change:**
The ongoing climate crisis results in increased extreme weather events, ecosystem disruptions, and severe socio-economic consequences. The necessity for immediate action regarding emissions reductions and climate adaptation strategies is more pressing than ever.

### Conclusion:
Given these findings, it is unequivocally supported by scientific research that human activities cause climate change, necessitating global cooperation toward effective climate action.
