### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Southern economy during the antebellum period was significantly threatened by various federal policies and actions, including tariffs, abolitionist movements, and trade restrictions, which created economic distress and contributed to the tensions leading to the Civil War.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The antebellum South's economy was heavily based on agriculture, primarily cotton, and relied on a system of slave labor. Importantly, federal actions such as tariffs, particularly the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832, were perceived by Southern states as detrimental to their economic interests since they primarily exported raw materials and imported manufactured goods. These tariffs raised the prices of goods for the South, limiting their trade capabilities and bolstering Northern industries. 

Additionally, the growing abolitionist movement increased tensions, causing fears among Southern plantation owners regarding the future of their labor system and economic stability. 

Trade restrictions and debates over the expansion of slavery into new territories fueled the South's anxiety regarding their economic viability. As the North industrialized and the South remained agrarian, economic disparities became pronounced, culminating in the idea of secession as a means of protecting their economy. Economic distress due to these policies and public sentiment against federal intervention contributed directly to the Southern states' decision to secede from the Union and ultimately led to the Civil War.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The conflict over economic policies not only fueled political disagreements but also reflected deeper social divisions between the North and South. Understanding these economic pressures is essential for comprehending the eventual outbreak of the Civil War.
