### How World War II Ended the Great Depression

#### Economic Situation During the Great Depression:
The Great Depression began in 1929 and lasted through the late 1930s, marked by massive unemployment rates peaking at around 25% in 1933 and significant declines in GDP. This period saw widespread economic hardship, which persisted until the onset of World War II.

#### Transformation of the Economy Due to World War II:
With the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, military spending surged dramatically. U.S. military expenditures rose from approximately $9 billion in 1939 to over $100 billion annually by the war's peak.

As a result of this spending, there was a massive boost in employment, creating over 19 million jobs and reducing the unemployment rate to around 1.2% by 1944. This job growth included an influx of women and minorities into the workforce, as labor shortages prompted new recruitment strategies.

The nation also saw tremendous GDP growth, with an increase of about 15% annually during the early years of the war, nearly doubling real GDP from $208 billion in 1940 to over $318 billion in 1945. Industrial output expanded as factories transitioned to military production, setting the stage for long-term growth.

#### Lasting Economic Effects Post-WWII:
The effects of military spending during WWII created a foundation for sustained economic growth, as many industries that expanded during the war continued to thrive in the following decades. The advancements in technology and infrastructure developed during the war also benefited the peacetime economy. Eventually, these wartime policies shaped future fiscal strategies centered around government spending as a tool for economic stimulation.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the military-driven demand during World War II drastically transformed the U.S. economy, helping to end the Great Depression by reducing unemployment and driving significant GDP growth. The economic policies and structures established during this period laid a robust foundation for post-war prosperity.
