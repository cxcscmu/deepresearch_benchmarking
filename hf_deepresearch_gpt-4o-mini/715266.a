### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Due to technical restrictions and insufficient resources, I was unable to retrieve specific academic or organizational articles on the causes of resentment in marriage.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
While I could not access external sources, the general knowledge on the causes of resentment in marriages can be highlighted. Common causes include lack of communication, unmet expectations, financial stress, infidelity, and differing values. Numerous studies suggest that:
- **Lack of Communication**: Failing to express feelings or concerns can lead to misunderstandings and resentment. Over time, partners may feel neglected if their emotional needs aren't addressed.
- **Unmet Expectations**: When partners have differing expectations about roles, responsibilities, or emotional support, this can lead to feelings of disappointment and hurt.
- **Financial Stress**: Financial problems often exacerbate tensions in a marriage. Disagreements about spending, saving, and financial priorities can cause significant strain.
- **Infidelity**: Betrayal can create profound feelings of hurt and distrust, leading to lingering resentment even after the issue is addressed, unless both partners actively work through the aftermath.
- **Differing Values**: Conflicts arising from fundamental differences in beliefs or values can create a rift between partners, making compromise and mutual understanding more difficult.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding resentment in marriage is essential for fostering healthy relationships. Couples are encouraged to communicate openly, establish mutual expectations, and seek help when financial or emotional issues arise. Professional counseling can also facilitate resolution for couples struggling with these issues.
