### 1. Task outcome (short version):

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- Stigma is a complex issue in mental health that encompasses negative labeling and discrimination against individuals with mental health issues. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stigma can prevent individuals from seeking help, lead to discrimination in workplaces and social interactions, and increase feelings of shame and isolation. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) emphasizes that stigma consists of two components: public stigma, which is when society labels people with mental illness negatively, and self-stigma, which is when individuals internalize those negative views, undermining their own self-worth. Stigma can manifest in various forms, including public discrimination, social rejection, and even institutional barriers that deny individuals with mental health issues equal opportunities in society. These stigma-related barriers can significantly hinder recovery and wellbeing.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
- Understanding stigma in mental health is crucial for addressing the broader public health issue and promoting better mental health services and support. Efforts to reduce stigma involve awareness campaigns, education, and advocacy to foster empathy and understanding.
