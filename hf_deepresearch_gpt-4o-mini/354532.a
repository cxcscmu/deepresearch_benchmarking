### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current international business trends post-COVID-19 include accelerated digital transformation, shifts in consumer behavior, vulnerabilities in supply chains, and increased focus on automation and remote work.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
1. **Digital Transformation**: The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digital technologies across businesses. Companies rapidly implemented online services and remote work structures that would have typically taken years to evolve. For example, McKinsey reported that businesses achieved a decade's worth of digital transformation in a matter of months.

2. **Consumer Behavior Shifts**: The way consumers interact with brands and make purchases has shifted significantly. E-commerce has grown exponentially, with many consumers preferring online shopping over traditional retail. This shift has forced companies to adapt their marketing and sales strategies to better accommodate online buyers.

3. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: The pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in global supply chains, prompting many businesses to reconsider their dependencies on international supplier networks. Companies are seeking to diversify their supply sources and increase inventory levels to mitigate risks associated with future disruptions.

4. **Adaptation of Workforce**: The remote work model has seen a significant uptick; businesses have found that employees can be just as productive when working from home. A report indicated that approximately 25% more workers may need to transition to new job roles or industries. Companies are focusing on developing flexible work arrangements to attract and retain talent.

5. **Focus on Automation**: There has been an increase in automation as companies seek to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Automation not only helps in streamlining operations but also addresses labor shortages that have become more acute in some sectors post-pandemic.

6. **Globalization Trends**: While globalization suffered during the pandemic, there are signs of recovery in international business investments. The Harvard Business Review noted that after a significant decline, foreign direct investment (FDI) and other international business activities are rebounding, though with heightened caution and strategic reevaluation.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Businesses facing these trends must actively adapt to the changing landscape to remain competitive. Strategic investments in technology, employee training for new roles, and robust supply chain practices are critical moving forward.
