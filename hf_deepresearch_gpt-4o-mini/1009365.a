### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The American Civil War was preceded by a series of events and conflicts over the issues of slavery, states' rights, and territorial expansion.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The events leading up to the Civil War began in the early 19th century and were marked by significant tensions between the North and South over economic, social, and political issues.

1. **Missouri Compromise (1820)**: This was one of the first major legislative attempts to address the issue of slavery’s expansion into the territories. It allowed Missouri to enter as a slave state and Maine as a free state, establishing a line of latitude that would determine the future status of slavery in the Louisiana Territory.

2. **Compromise of 1850**: This package of five bills aimed to defuse tensions by admitting California as a free state while allowing other territories to decide for themselves about slavery. It also included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act, which stirred opposition in the North.

3. **Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**: This act created Kansas and Nebraska territories and allowed settlers in those territories to determine if they would be slave or free (popular sovereignty). This led to violent conflicts known as "Bleeding Kansas" as pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces clashed.

4. **Dred Scott Decision (1857)**: The Supreme Court ruled that African Americans were not citizens and could not sue in federal courts, and that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in the territories. This infuriated abolitionists and heightened sectional tensions.

5. **John Brown’s Raid (1859)**: Abolitionist John Brown led a failed raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry in an attempt to incite a slave uprising. His execution polarized the North and South further.

6. **Election of 1860**: The election of Abraham Lincoln, who campaigned on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, prompted Southern states to consider secession, leading to the formation of the Confederacy.

7. **Secession**: After Lincoln’s election, several Southern states seceded from the Union, starting with South Carolina in December 1860, ultimately forming the Confederate States of America.

8. **Battle of Fort Sumter (April 1861)**: The conflict officially began when Confederate forces fired on Union-held Fort Sumter in South Carolina, prompting Lincoln to call for troops and thus mobilizing both sides for war.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the events leading to the Civil War is crucial in understanding the complex history of the United States, particularly issues surrounding race, rights, and governance that continue to resonate today. The war itself was fundamentally a culmination of these unresolved tensions, making it a pivotal moment in American history.
