## Canada’s Involvement in World War II

### Introduction
Canada's involvement in World War II marked a significant shift in its foreign policy and national identity. 

### Declaration of War
On September 10, 1939, shortly after Britain declared war on Germany, Canada declared war, marking its first major military action that underscored its autonomy from Britain.

### Military Contributions
Canada mobilized over one million men and women for military service and participated in key operations such as the Battle of Britain, the Dieppe Raid, and the D-Day invasion at Juno Beach. Personal stories exemplify the bravery of Canadians, including soldiers like Tommy Prince and nurses like Mary H. Henniger, who served on the front lines.

### Economic Contributions
Canada emerged as a crucial supplier of war materials for the Allies, producing over 800,000 military vehicles, approximately 2 billion rounds of ammunition, and over 1,400 aircraft, including Avro Lancasters. The extensive production efforts stimulated job creation and industrial growth.

### Social Contributions
The war led to significant social changes, including increased employment for women in predominantly male roles, which contributed to a shift in gender dynamics. Civilians managed rationing efforts and supported war industries. However, internment impacted Canadians of Japanese descent, reflecting both the challenges and resilience faced by minorities.

### Government Policies
The Canadian government enacted policies such as the National Resources Mobilization Act for conscription, the establishment of the Department of Munitions and Supply for production oversight, and price controls and rationing to manage resources effectively. These policies played a pivotal role in mobilizing Canada’s resources for the war effort.

### Conclusion
Overall, Canada's participation in World War II significantly transformed its military, economy, and society. The contributions and sacrifices made during this period laid the groundwork for the contemporary Canadian identity and highlighted the importance of unity in the face of global challenges.
