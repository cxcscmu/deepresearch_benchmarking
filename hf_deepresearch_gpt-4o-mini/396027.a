The use of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) would compromise Ben & Jerry's mission. The company is dedicated to producing high-quality ice cream and upholding values of social justice, environmental sustainability, and community engagement. 
Ben & Jerry's sources its dairy exclusively from family-owned farms that adhere to stringent animal welfare standards and explicitly avoids utilizing CAFOs. 
This commitment is in direct alignment with their mission, as CAFOs are generally associated with negative environmental impact and ethical concerns regarding animal treatment. Therefore, the absence of CAFOs complements their objectives and principles, reaffirming their commitment to responsible sourcing and social responsibility.
