### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Recent academic research from 2020 to 2023 indicates conflicted findings related to the correlation between video games, particularly violent video games (VVG), and aggression. A significant amount of studies have explored this relationship, revealing both supportive and contradictory evidence regarding the impact of VVG on players' behavior.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
1. **Violent Video Games and Aggression**: Despite the popular narrative linking violent video gaming to aggression and diminished empathy, recent studies have presented varied outcomes:
   - A **2023 systematic review** analyzed the impacts of violent video games among children and adolescents in the Arab world. The findings were inconsistent, suggesting no definitive association between video game violence and aggressive behavior (source: PMC10210558).
   - **A 2024 longitudinal study** on Czech adolescents reported that exposure to VVG was related to increased levels of aggression; however, it also indicated that empathy levels were not adversely affected (source: ScienceDirect).
   - Another study published in **2024** concluded that acute exposure to violent video games did not change neurocognitive markers of empathic concern in inexperienced male gamers, reinforcing the idea that aggression may not be directly induced by gameplay (source: PMC11223611).
   - Additionally, a review highlighted the dual effects of both violent and prosocial video games, suggesting that VVG can result in aggressive outcomes but also has the potential to increase pro-social behavior based on game elements (source: Current Opinion in Psychology).

2. **Stance of the Academic Community**: Research challenges the notion that VVG directly correlates with violent behavior in real-world scenarios. Many studies propose that while VVG may temporarily increase aggression levels, they do not lead to serious physical violence. A **2023 analysis from Stanford researchers** found no causal link between VVG and actual violence, instead suggesting that gaming could serve as an outlet for aggression (source: Fortune).

3. **Trends and Public Perception**: As public discourse continues to explore video games' effects, several surveys indicate a disconnect between gaming habits and societal beliefs about violence. For instance, a Pew Research survey showed nearly 53% of adults do not believe there is a connection between violent video games and real-life violence (source: Pew Research Center).

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The examination of video games' impact on violence is influenced not only by the studies themselves but also by societal beliefs, parenting trends, and the psychological frameworks related to aggression. As gaming continues to evolve, ongoing research is crucial to understanding its implications on behavior. More longitudinal studies and comprehensive reviews are needed to form a conclusive understanding of this topic.
