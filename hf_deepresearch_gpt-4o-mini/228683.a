## The Role of Culture in the Formation of Ethics

### Definitions
- **Culture**: In sociology and anthropology, culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, norms, and practices that characterize a social group or society, influencing individual behavior and social interactions. It shapes the way individuals understand their environment and their roles within it.
- **Ethics**: Ethics in philosophy is the study of moral principles guiding human conduct, while in sociology, it examines how societal norms influence ethical behavior.

### How Culture Influences Ethics
1. **Cultural Relativism**: Ethics vary across cultures; what is considered ethical in one culture may be perceived as unethical in another. For example, practices deemed acceptable in the Inuit culture related to survival may be viewed as infanticide elsewhere.

2. **Ethnographic Examples**:
   - **Ritual Practices**: Different cultures have unique ethical perspectives on practices like animal sacrifice.
   - **Gender Roles**: Society-defined gender roles can shape individuals' ethical responsibilities.
   - **The !Kung San of the Kalahari**: Their communal lifestyle emphasizes collective support as a moral imperative.

### Historical Perspectives
1. **Ancient Greece**: Philosophers like Socrates explored ethics that focused on personal virtue within societal expectations.
2. **India**: The concept of Dharma from texts like the Bhagavad Gita shapes ethical behavior, intertwining duty with cultural beliefs.
3. **Medieval Islamic World**: Sharia incorporates cultural practices to guide ethical conduct in various aspects of life.
4. **Enlightenment Era**: Rational thought during the Enlightenment influenced ethical theories, emphasizing individual rights within cultural contexts.

### Conclusion
Understanding the interplay between culture and ethics is crucial for analyzing current ethical dilemmas, especially in an increasingly globalized world where diverse cultural perspectives challenge static ethical norms.
