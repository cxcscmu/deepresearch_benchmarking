#### 1. Civil War
- **Women**: Many women took on roles traditionally held by men, becoming nurses, spies, and even soldiers disguised as men. Organizations such as the United States Sanitary Commission were founded to support the Union Army, with notable figures like Clara Barton, who later founded the American Red Cross. The involvement of women in the war effort was pivotal as they filled essential roles in the absence of men.
- **African Americans**: By the end of the war, nearly 200,000 African American soldiers served in the Union Army. Their participation was crucial for changing perceptions regarding race and advancing the cause for emancipation. Their bravery and sacrifices helped in the fight for freedom and equality.

#### 2. World War I

- **African Americans**: Although the military segregated African American soldiers, units like the 369th Infantry Regiment (the Harlem Hellfighters) earned acclaim for their bravery in combat. Many African Americans also worked in wartime industries, contributing significantly to the overall war effort.

#### 3. World War II
