### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Soviet Union established communist governments in Eastern Europe after World War II mainly to expand its influence, secure its western borders, and promote the spread of communism as a countermeasure against potential threats from the West.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
After World War II, the Soviet Union undertook significant efforts to establish communist regimes in Eastern Europe for several reasons:
1. **Geopolitical Security**: The USSR sought to create a buffer zone against potential invasions from the West, especially after the experiences of World War II when it faced devastating attacks. By establishing friendly communist governments in countries like Poland, Hungary, and East Germany, the Soviet Union aimed to protect itself from future attacks.

2. **Spread of Communism**: As the ideological leader of the communist movement, the Soviet Union aimed to spread communism and its influence worldwide. Establishing communist governments in Eastern Europe was a strategic move to promote Marxist-Leninist theories and demonstrate the perceived superiority of communism over capitalism.

3. **Control and Influence**: The establishment of these governments allowed the Soviet Union to maintain direct control over the political and economic systems of Eastern European countries, ensuring they adhered to Soviet policies and aligned with Soviet interests in global politics.

4. **Political Stability**: In the wake of the war, many Eastern European countries were left politically unstable and economically devastated. The Soviet Union capitalized on this situation by supporting local communist parties and movements that promised stability and social reforms, thus creating governance structures that were loyal to Moscow.

5. **Western Containment**: The Soviet Union's actions were also a response to the growing influence of the West, particularly the United States. By establishing communist regimes, it sought to counterbalance the Western powers and their attempts to contain Soviet expansion (the emerging Cold War).

6. **Potsdam and Yalta Agreements**: Both conferences established certain spheres of influence in Europe. The agreements allowed the USSR to have control over Eastern Europe, which was recognized by the Allies as a necessary step to secure post-war peace.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The establishment of these communist governments led to significant political tensions and eventually contributed to the Cold War. It also caused deep socio-political divides in Europe, impacting international relations for decades.
