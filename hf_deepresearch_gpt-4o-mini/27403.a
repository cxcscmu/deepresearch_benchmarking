### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Key events in Europe after World War I include significant treaties like the Treaty of Versailles, notable economic changes leading to instability, and the rise of totalitarian political movements.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
After World War I, Europe experienced profound transformations across multiple dimensions:

1. **Treaties**:  
   - **Treaty of Versailles (1919)**: This treaty formally ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It imposed heavy reparations on Germany and redrew national boundaries, leading to significant territorial losses for Germany. The treaty is often cited as a catalyst for political unrest in Germany, ultimately contributing to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.
   - **Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919)**: This treaty dismantled the Austro-Hungarian Empire, establishing new nations including Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, but also left ethnic tensions unresolved, causing future conflicts.
   - **Treaty of Trianon (1920)**: This treaty resulted in significant territorial loss for Hungary, which was transformational for Hungary's national identity and contributed to nationalist sentiments in the interwar period.

2. **Economic Changes**:  
   - The post-war period was marked by economic hardships across Europe, including hyperinflation, especially in Germany due to reparations. The economy struggled during the 1920s, eventually leading to the Great Depression in 1929, which devastated economies and increased unemployment. Countries around Europe faced political instability as economic distress fueled social unrest.
   - The reparations and harsh economic conditions contributed to economic instability, which in turn led to the rise of extremist political movements.

3. **Political Movements**:  
   - The war and its aftermath saw the emergence of several political ideologies in Europe. 
   - The rise of **fascism** particularly in Italy under Mussolini and later in Germany under Hitler, was in part a reaction to the perceived failures of the Treaty of Versailles and economic conditions. These regimes capitalized on nationalist sentiments and the socio-economic dissatisfaction among the populace.
   - The **Russian Revolution (1917)** continued to exert influence in Europe, leading to the spread of communism and painting it as a solution for economic woes, which also caused significant fear in capitalist societies.

Overall, the interconnectedness of treaties, economic conditions, and political movements in post-World War I Europe set the stage for future conflicts, including World War II.
