### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The British monarchy underwent significant changes during the Stuart period from 1603 to 1689, characterized by key events such as the English Civil War, the execution of Charles I, the establishment of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, and the Restoration of Charles II. Legislative changes during this time altered the relationship between the monarchy and Parliament, leading to an eventual constitutional monarchy.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Stuart period was pivotal in transforming the monarchy in Britain, spanning from 1603 with the ascendancy of James I to 1689 with the Glorious Revolution. Key monarchs included:
- **James I (1603-1625)**: The first Stuart king, he sought to unify England and Scotland and believed in the divine right of kings, which strained relations with Parliament.
- **Charles I (1625-1649)**: His reign saw escalating tensions with Parliament, culminating in the English Civil War. He was executed in 1649, marking a drastic shift in royal authority.
- **Oliver Cromwell (1653-1658)**: As the leader of the Parliamentarian forces, he ruled as Lord Protector, abolishing the monarchy temporarily and establishing a republic.
- **Charles II (1660-1685)**: The monarchy was restored under him in 1660, but his reign kept the balance of power shifting towards Parliament.
- **James II (1685-1689)**: His attempts to re-establish Catholicism and royal authority led to the Glorious Revolution, which saw his deposition.

Key events include the **Petition of Right (1628)**, which curtailed the king's power, the **English Civil War (1642-1651)**, the **Commonwealth (1649-1660)**, and the **Glorious Revolution (1688)**, which resulted in the Bill of Rights (1689) and established parliamentary supremacy. Legislative changes included greater assertiveness from Parliament and the decline of absolute monarchy, showcasing the evolution towards a constitutional monarchy where Parliament held significant power over the monarch.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Stuart period reflects the complexities of early modern governance and the moving away from divine-right absolutism towards parliamentary democracy. The interactions between the monarchy and Parliament were marked by conflict and negotiation, ultimately shaping the governance of modern Britain.
