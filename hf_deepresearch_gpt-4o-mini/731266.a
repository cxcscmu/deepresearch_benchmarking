Inequality generally hurts economic growth. High levels of income inequality can lead to instability and restrict the economic mobility necessary for growth. 
Conversely, income redistribution policies tend to positively influence economic growth by creating a more equitable distribution of resources. 
Therefore, while inequality may offer short-term advantages, sustainable growth is more likely to thrive in equitable environments that manage income inequality effectively.
