### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry by introducing the assembly line production method and creating the affordable Model T, making car ownership accessible to the general public.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Henry Ford's contributions to the automobile industry were transformative and pivotal. His most significant contributions include:

- **Introduction of the Assembly Line:** In 1913, Ford implemented the moving assembly line in his manufacturing plants, which drastically reduced the time and cost of production. For instance, the time it took to assemble a Model T decreased from over 12 hours to just about 90 minutes. This innovation helped Ford manufacture cars at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.

- **Model T Production:** Launched in 1908, the Model T became the first affordable automobile, initially priced at $850 and later dropping to around $260 due to mass production techniques. It became immensely popular and sold millions, profoundly changing personal transport and contributing to the expansion of a consumer-based economy.

- **Standardization of Parts:** Ford standardized vehicle parts, which simplified the manufacturing process and allowed for mass production. This innovation not only enhanced production efficiency but also set a precedent for other industries to follow suit.

- **Labor Reforms:** Ford was also known for implementing a $5 per day wage for his workers in 1914, which was considered high for the time. This wage attracted skilled workers, reduced turnover, and allowed workers to purchase the very cars they were making.

- **Vertical Integration:** Ford Motor Company practiced vertical integration by controlling all aspects of production, from raw materials to final assembly, ensuring efficiency and quality control.

- **Cultural Impact:** Ford's affordability revolutionized transportation, leading to increased mobility for the average American and stimulating infrastructure developments, including roads and highways. His practices also contributed to the growth of suburbs and the associated societal changes.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Henry Ford's influence extends beyond the automobile industry; his methods laid the groundwork for modern manufacturing practices and inspired other industries to adopt similar mass production techniques. His pursuit of efficiency and productivity continues to resonate in today's manufacturing world.
