Philip II of Spain (1527-1598) served as king from 1556 until his death, overseeing a period known for its vast territorial empire and cultural achievements. His reign was pivotal in establishing Spain as a dominant European power.

One of his notable contributions was the patronage of arts and culture.

Key figures influenced by his reign include:
- **El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos)**: A prominent painter whose work blended Byzantine and Western styles, he was encouraged by Philip II and created several notable pieces for the King.
- **Diego Velázquez**: The leading painter of the Spanish Golden Age, known for works such as "Las Meninas," which was later inspired by the cultural environment cultivated under Philip II.
- **Francisco de Quevedo** and **Garcilaso de la Vega**: Important poets and writers who thrived during this time, largely due to the cultural patronage that encouraged literary expression.

Philip's reign also saw the construction of significant architectural works, such as the El Escorial monastery and palace, which exemplified the Renaissance style. These developments not only served as royal residences but also became cultural and religious centers, enhancing Spain's prestige.

Overall, Philip II's influence laid down extensive artistic foundations that resonated throughout the Golden Age, fostering a culture that would have a lasting legacy on Europe.
