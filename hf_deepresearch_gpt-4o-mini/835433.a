### Short-Term Causes of World War I

1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**
   - Date: June 28, 1914
   - Location: Sarajevo
   - Perpetrator: Gavrilo Princip, a member of the nationalist group Black Hand.
   - Impact: The assassination was viewed as an affront to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and triggered a series of diplomatic and military responses.

2. **July Crisis**
   - Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia with several harsh demands.
   - Serbia's response was deemed insufficient by Austria-Hungary, which declared war on July 28, 1914.

3. **Involvement of Allied Nations**
   - The declaration of war activated a chain reaction among European powers structured around alliances:
       - Germany supported Austria-Hungary.
       - Russia mobilized in defense of Serbia.
       - France and Britain were drawn into the conflict due to their ententes with Russia and existing obligations regarding Belgian neutrality.

4. **Diplomatic Failures**
   - The July Crisis highlighted the failure of diplomacy among world leaders who could not effectively communicate and manage tensions. 
   - Militaristic policies and rising nationalism further exacerbated the situation, leading to widespread mobilization and conflict by early August 1914.

5. **Context**
   - Pre-war alliances (Triple Alliance and Triple Entente) created a complex web of obligations, pulling multiple nations into conflict from what began as a regional dispute.

### Conclusion
The series of events surrounding the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent July Crisis are pivotal in understanding the rapid sequence of actions that led to the outbreak of World War I, illustrating how nationalistic ambitions and imperial rivalries contributed to one of history's largest conflicts.
