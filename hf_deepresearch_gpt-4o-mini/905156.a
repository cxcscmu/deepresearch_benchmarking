Introduction:
Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, impacting millions of people worldwide through various environmental, health, and socio-economic dimensions.

Health Impacts:
Climate change significantly threatens public health, leading to increased rates of diseases, health problems related to extreme weather events, and decreased access to clean air and water.

Economic Impacts:
In 2023, the U.S. experienced 28 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, with economic losses totaling at least $92.9 billion. Globally, the commitments indicate a projected income reduction of 19% by 2050.

Migration Trends:
In 2023, around 26.4 million people were displaced due to climate-related disasters. By 2050, projections indicate that between 44 million and 216 million people may migrate due to climate change impacts.

Conclusion:
The implications of these findings underline the urgent need for comprehensive climate policies and proactive strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations.
