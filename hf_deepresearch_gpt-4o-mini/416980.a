### Economic Implications of Immigration

Immigration has a profound positive impact on the economy by enriching the labor force, driving consumer spending, and fostering innovation. Statistical data indicates that immigration significantly contributes to economic growth, and studies show that it does not adversely affect employment rates for native workers.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Economic Growth**: 
   - Immigrants constitute approximately 14.3% of the U.S. population, a marked increase from 4.7% in 1970.
   - Research indicates that immigration can add about 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth annually, largely due to workforce expansion and increased consumer demand.

2. **Employment Rates**:
   - Contrary to misconceptions, studies reveal that immigration has not led to job losses for native-born workers and may even increase their wages due to complementary skill sets between immigrants and native workers.

3. **Sector Impact**:
   - Immigrants fill crucial roles in sectors such as technology and healthcare, making them instrumental in addressing labor shortages and enhancing competitiveness.

4. **Tax Contributions**:
   - Increased immigration leads to higher tax revenues, benefitting public services and infrastructure.

5. **Demographic Shifts**:
   - A significant portion of recent immigrants are from Mexico, influencing the workforce composition and economic dynamics.

### Conclusion
The consensus among economists is that immigration enhances economic performance and contributes to various positive growth outcomes in the economy. This aligns with data and reports from credible institutions, including the Migration Policy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute, which support these findings while dismissing the myths surrounding immigration's negative impact.

For further studies and statistics, reviewing reports from these institutions and accessing comprehensive datasets is encouraged.
