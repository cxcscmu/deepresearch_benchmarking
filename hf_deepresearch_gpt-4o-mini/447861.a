### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The collapse of East Germany in 1989 was significantly influenced by the Soviet Union's policies and political stance, particularly due to the reforms initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev which led to a decline in Soviet support for hardline communist regimes in Eastern Europe.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The breakdown of East Germany, formally known as the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in 1989 cannot be understood without acknowledging the crucial role of the Soviet Union. Originally established in 1949 as a communist state, East Germany relied heavily on Soviet backing for political and economic support. However, in the 1980s, several factors contributed to its eventual collapse:

1. **Soviet Reforms Under Gorbachev**: Mikhail Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985 and began implementing significant reforms. Policies like *Glasnost* (openness) and *Perestroika* (restructuring) aimed at liberalizing the Soviet economy and encouraging more transparency in government but also emboldened dissent across Eastern Europe, including in East Germany.

2. **Declining Soviet Support**: Gorbachev's reduced willingness to use military force to maintain control over Eastern Europe diminished the ideological and military support the GDR had traditionally received. Eastern European nations began to question the legitimacy of their regimes, emboldened by the fact that the Soviet Union would not intervene to quell unrest.

3. **Growing Dissent in East Germany**: By the late 1980s, public frustration with the regime reached a boiling point, fueled in part by the broader context of Gorbachevâ€™s reforms. The citizens of East Germany began to demand greater political freedoms and economic improvements. Massive protests began in 1989, particularly the peaceful Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig, which rallied thousands of citizens demanding change.

4. **The Fall of the Berlin Wall**: On November 9, 1989, after weeks of mounting pressure and protests, the Berlin Wall was opened, symbolizing the collapse of the East German government and its communist regime, marking an end to the repressive state that had been heavily supported by the Soviet Union.

5. **Aftermath**: Following the fall of the Wall, East Germany quickly transitioned towards reunification with West Germany, which was officially completed on October 3, 1990. This reunification was largely seen as a direct consequence of the Soviet Union's shift away from hardline policies and its inability to maintain control over its satellite states.

In essence, the influence of the Soviet Union can be seen as a double-edged sword; while it had supported East Germany for decades, its later policies inadvertently facilitated the conditions for East Germany's collapse.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The collapse of East Germany and the subsequent reunification with West Germany ushered in a significant transformation for both the German and global political landscapes. The event was pivotal not only in German history but also contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union itself, culminating a period known as the Cold War.
