### 1. Definition of Perceptual Development
Perceptual development refers to the progression of the ability to interpret, understand, and respond to sensory stimuli from the environment. This development is crucial for various cognitive functions and is influenced by both biological and environmental factors.

### 2. Innate Factors in Perceptual Development
The nativist perspective argues that perceptual abilities are largely determined by genetics and biological maturation. Proponents of this view believe that certain perceptual skills, such as depth perception and visual recognition, are present at birth. For example, studies on newborns show that they can distinguish between different stimuli, indicating a pre-existing capability for perceptual processing.

### 3. Socially Acquired Factors in Perceptual Development
Conversely, the constructivist viewpoint emphasizes the role of social interactions and environmental contexts in developing perceptual skills. Researchers argue that experience is essential for refining perceptual abilities. For example, infants learn to recognize faces through repeated exposure to caregivers, demonstrating that social learning is critical for perceptual development.

### 4. Current Understanding and Synthesis
Most contemporary research suggests that perceptual development is not strictly one or the other but rather a combination of both innate and socially acquired processes. While biological factors lay the groundwork, social experiences shape and enhance these foundational abilities.

### 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, perceptual development arises through a complex interplay between innate biological predispositions and social learning experiences, indicating that it cannot be solely classified as either innate or acquired.
