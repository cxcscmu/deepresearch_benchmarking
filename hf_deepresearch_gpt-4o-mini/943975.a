### 1. When to Raise Dependencies as Program Risks:
- **Critical Path Impact**: Dependencies that are on a critical path affecting project delivery timelines.
- **Resource Limitations**: Dependencies with scarce resources that could result in project delays.
- **Higher-Level Risks**: Dependencies that involve vendors, regulations, or technologies with known reliability issues.
- **Lack of Clear Owner**: Unclear responsibility for monitoring and managing dependencies can increase risk.
- **Frequent Changes**: Dependencies subject to change may increase uncertainty and risk.

### 2. Best Practices:
- Regular dependency reviews in project status meetings.
- Formal identification and documentation of dependencies during project planning.
- Utilization of risk matrices for assessing impact and likelihood of dependency issues.

### 3. Recommendations:
- Consult the latest guidelines from methodologies like PMBOK, PRINCE2, and Agile for structured approaches to risk management.
- Maintain communication with stakeholders for effective dependency management.
