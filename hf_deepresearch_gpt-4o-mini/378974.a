### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The United States had a complex and often criticized response to the Holocaust, primarily characterized by restrictive immigration policies and limited direct intervention during the refugee crisis.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
During the Holocaust, the U.S. government's response involved a mix of humanitarian and political factors. The U.S. had significant opportunities to aid Jewish refugees fleeing Europe but implemented restrictive immigration policies that limited the number of individuals who could escape Nazi persecution. 

1. **Immigration Policies**: Notably, the U.S. established a quota system that severely limited the number of visas issued, particularly for Jewish refugees. The 1924 Immigration Act emphasized quotas based on national origins, disadvantaging those from Eastern Europe.

2. **Public Opinion and Political Pressures**: There was significant public sentiment against the influx of immigrants, influenced by the economic hardships of the Great Depression. Many Americans were reluctant to accept more refugees due to perceived competition for jobs and resources.

3. **Military Actions and Information**: Although aware of the atrocities occurring in Europe, the U.S. government took little military action to intervene during the height of the Holocaust. Efforts to bomb concentration camps or supply routes were continuously rejected. The government was focused on the war effort, which overshadowed humanitarian intervention.

4. **The War Refugee Board**: In 1944, facing mounting pressure and criticism, the U.S. created the War Refugee Board. This board aimed to provide relief and rescue efforts for Jews, later aiding in the rescue of approximately 200,000 Jews from Europe. However, this was largely viewed as a late response to the ongoing genocides.

5. **Key Events and Figures**:
Key figures like President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull faced criticism for their inaction. While Roosevelt made speeches referencing the plight of Jews, many believed that these were more rhetorical than substantive.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
After the war, the U.S. stance shifted, leading to more open immigration policies for Holocaust survivors and a commitment to prevent such atrocities from happening again, ultimately leading to the establishment of Israel and new human rights policies.
