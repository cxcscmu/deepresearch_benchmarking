{'Report': {'Cultural Significance': 'Dream catchers, originally created by the Ojibwa (Chippewa) people, serve as protective talismans with deep cultural significance. Their commercialization raises concerns of cultural appropriation, as non-Indigenous people profit from a sacred item without proper understanding or respect for the original meanings.', 'Cultural Appropriation Definition': 'Cultural appropriation is the adoption of cultural elements from marginalized groups by dominant cultures, often resulting in exploitation and a lack of respect for the original context.', 'Conclusion': 'Based on the gathered information, the commercialization of dream catchers often disregards their cultural significance and origins. Many Indigenous people call for recognition and respect for their cultural symbols, advocating that dream catchers should be created and sold by Indigenous artisans to honor their traditions. Thus, while dream catchers may be used by non-Indigenous individuals, the commercialization without understanding or consent leads to the conclusion that this practice constitutes cultural appropriation.'}}
