### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change refers to significant alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns over time, primarily driven by human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes, resulting in an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change is defined as long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily attributed to human activities since the late 19th century, coinciding with the industrialization era. While climate change can occur naturally due to factors like volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation, the current trend is predominantly anthropogenic, meaning caused by human actions. The primary driver of contemporary climate change is the greenhouse effect, where gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to global warming, which manifests in various ways, including rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts, floods), and drastic shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity. The impacts of climate change threaten global food security, health, economies, and sustainability, and it prompts international cooperation for mitigation and adaptation strategies, particularly through frameworks like the Paris Agreement aimed at limiting global temperature rise.

### 3. Additional Context on the document and question asked:
The complete file provided appears to contain a structured document from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or a related organization, focusing on climate science and terminology, such as a glossary. The mention of climate change aligns with the core themes of the IPCC's work, which assesses scientific knowledge on climate change, its impacts, and measures to mitigate its consequences. Understanding climate change is critical in the context of global discussions on environmental policy, sustainable development, and efforts to combat its adverse effects on human and ecological systems.
