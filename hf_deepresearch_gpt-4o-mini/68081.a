The case studies reflect various successful techniques and programs that have significantly reduced bullying incidents in schools: 

1. **Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP)**:
   - One of the most researched and widely used programs in the US and Europe, OBPP involves a school-wide approach that includes staff training, student involvement, and clear school rules against bullying. Studies have shown a reduction in student-reported bullying by approximately 50% after implementation.

2. **KiVa Program**:
   - Originating from Finland, KiVa is built on a strong backing of research and aims to prevent bullying through education, awareness, and active reporting. Initial studies indicated a significant decrease in incidences of bullying among participating schools.

3. **Bullyproofing Your School**:
   - This program emphasizes raising awareness about bullying across the school. It includes workshops for parents, teacher training sessions, and activities for students. Evaluations have shown that schools implementing this method reported improvements in classroom behavior and a decrease in bullying.

4. **Second Step Program**:
   - Focused on social-emotional learning, this program promotes empathy and teaches children how to handle disagreements and conflicts in constructive ways. Participating schools have seen reductions in disciplinary incidents related to bullying.

5. **Restorative Practices**:
   - Many schools have shifted to restorative practices as an alternative to punitive measures. This approach engages students in dialogue about their experiences, resolving conflicts amicably. Schools employing these methods have reported improvements in school climate and reduction in repeat incidents of bullying.
