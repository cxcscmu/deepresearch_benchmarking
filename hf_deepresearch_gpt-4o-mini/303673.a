### Current Chicken Wing Shortage Report

**Introduction**
The chicken wing market is currently experiencing a significant shortage attributed to several interconnected factors. 

**Causes of the Shortage**
1. **Increased Consumer Demand**: Demand for chicken wings has surged, especially during major events like the Super Bowl when Americans consume approximately 1.47 billion wings.
2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to labor shortages and logistical challenges affecting poultry processing.
3. **Poultry Culling Due to Bird Flu**: Outbreaks of avian influenza have necessitated the culling of millions of birds, further diminishing the supply of chicken meat, including wings.

**Production and Pricing Trends**
- The USDA reported that a total of 178 million chickens were sold in 2023. The overall broiler production reached 9.16 billion.
- Wholesale chicken wing prices have fluctuated significantly; as of January 2023, prices were around $2.70 per pound, although this had dropped significantly from $3.49 per pound the previous year.

**Consumption Trends**
- Chicken wings are increasingly popular due to flavor innovations and the rise of health-conscious eating trends, including baked or air-fried wings.
- The growth of e-commerce and delivery services has also enhanced accessibility, allowing consumers to enjoy chicken wings in convenience.

**Conclusion**
This shortage is expected to continue as the demand for chicken wings remains strong amidst ongoing supply challenges. Understanding these dynamics can help both consumers and businesses navigate the evolving market landscape.
