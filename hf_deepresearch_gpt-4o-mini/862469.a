# Late-term Abortions in the United States: A Structured Report

## 1. Definition
Late-term abortions generally refer to abortions performed at or after 21 weeks of gestation. The term can be contentious, as it lacks a precise medical definition and varies significantly in legal contexts across different states.

## 2. Current Statistics
Currently, the exact statistics on the number of late-term abortions relative to total abortions are not detailed, but it is noted they represent a small percentage.

## 3. Reasons for Late-Term Abortions
The reasons individuals may seek late-term abortions include:
- Serious fetal anomalies that may not have been detectable earlier in pregnancy.
- Risks to the physical or mental health of the mother.
- Socio-economic factors or personal circumstances that influence the timing of the decision.

## 4. Legislation Context
State regulations vary widely. Some states impose bans on abortions after a gestational age (often between 20 to 24 weeks), while some allow abortions later depending on the mother's health.
