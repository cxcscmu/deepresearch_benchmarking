# Report on the Reasons Why Marijuana Should Remain Illegal

## 1. Marijuana-Related Crime Rates
According to the FBI's 2019 Uniform Crime Reporting data, marijuana-related arrests accounted for approximately 2.9% of all drug abuse violations in the United States. The distribution of these arrests by region highlights that marijuana is a significant contributor to drug violations, with states such as the Northeast reporting higher percentages.

## 2. Health Risks of Marijuana Use
Several studies indicate that marijuana poses several health risks including:
- **Addiction**: About 3 in 10 cannabis users develop cannabis use disorder, which can lead to dependency.
- **Cognitive Impairment**: Marijuana negatively affects brain functions, impacting memory, learning, and decision-making.
- **Cardiovascular Issues**: Increased heart rate and potential for long-term cardiovascular problems.
- **Respiratory Issues**: Smoking cannabis can result in lung damage similar to tobacco.

## 3. Impact of Legalization on Society
Legalization has yielded mixed societal impacts. While there is some evidence of economic benefits, such as increased employment in legalized states, public health concerns remain significant. Reports indicate a potential rise in adolescent use and associated health effects. In states that have legalized recreational marijuana, there has not been a significant increase in youth consumption according to data showing a decline from 23.1% in 2011 to 15.8% in 2021 among adolescents.

## 4. Current Legal Status
Marijuana remains illegal federally in the United States, with significant variation across states. Numerous countries have strict prohibitions on marijuana, while others have legalized its medical use or have moved toward recreational legalization. This ambiguous legal landscape leads to challenges in enforcement and public health messaging.

## 5. Conclusion
Given the data concerning crime rates, significant health risks, and ongoing public health issues, there is a compelling argument for maintaining the legality of marijuana as a controlled substance. The risks associated with consumption, especially concerning youth and societal safety, underline the need to keep marijuana illegal until further research clarifies its impacts.
