### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The sociological definition of race is that it is a social construct, which means it is not an inherent biological reality but rather a classification system shaped by social customs and historical contexts.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Race is understood in sociology as a socially constructed category of identification based on physical traits, ancestry, historical affiliation, and shared culture. Sociologists assert that there is no objective reality to race; it is defined by societies and cultures within specific contexts, and often this leads to significant societal implications such as discrimination and identity politics. This definition implies that social constructs can be fluid and vary across different societies, necessitating sensitivity in how categories are used. Commonly accepted terminology varies, and individuals may prefer distinct identification based on their background, necessitating precise language and cultural awareness when discussing race. The recognition of these constructs influences social interactions and policies regarding inequality and representation.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The understanding of race as a social construct has implications for various fields including sociology, anthropology, and civil rights movements. It emphasizes the importance of contextual and cultural awareness in discussing race and challenges the perception of fixed racial categories.
