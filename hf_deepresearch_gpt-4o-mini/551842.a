## 1. Causes of the Civil War
The American Civil War (1861-1865) was primarily caused by:
- **Slavery**: A central moral and economic debate, with the South's economy depending on slave labor.
- **States' Rights**: Southern states' advocacy for their right to self-governance, particularly regarding slavery.
- **Economic Differences**: Conflicts between the industrialized North and agrarian South, particularly tariffs.
- **Key Events**: Major legislative events such as the Missouri Compromise, Compromise of 1850, and Dred Scott Decision that heightened tensions.
- **Election of Abraham Lincoln**: His election spurred Southern states to secede, fearing abolition.

## 2. Outcomes of the Civil War
The Civil War changed the U.S. dramatically:
- **Abolition of Slavery**: The passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865 officially abolished slavery.
- **Human Cost**: An estimated 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers died, marking the war as the deadliest in U.S. history.
- **Reconstruction Era**: Initiated efforts to rebuild the South and integrate former slaves into society.
- **Political Changes**: Reinforced federal power over states and established civil rights for freed slaves through subsequent amendments.

## 3. Additional Context
The Civil War's legacy continues to influence American society in terms of:
- **Social Reforms**: It set the stage for future civil rights movements, with racial tensions persisting long after the war.
- **Economic Shifts**: The war accelerated industrialization in the North and devastated the Southern economy, with long-term repercussions.

In conclusion, the Civil War was pivotal in shaping the modern United States through its resolution of slavery, shifts in political power, and long-lasting societal impacts.
