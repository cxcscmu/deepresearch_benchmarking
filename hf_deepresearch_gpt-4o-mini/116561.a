### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Unfortunately, due to repeated limitations with tool access for web searches, I could not retrieve up-to-date information about the current legal framework of prisoner rights and international standards.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Despite my attempts to gather information regarding the UN's Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and variations in national laws, the tool I relied on failed to execute properly due to a lack of credits. I believe comprehensive data on these subjects is available in various legal databases, human rights reports, and online resources. However, my inability to access them directly means I cannot provide a detailed overview or the latest updates on these frameworks.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
To effectively address this task in the future:
- It may be useful to consult directly from resource databases dealing with international law, human rights publications, and governmental sources in specific countries.
- Engaging with reports from organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, or the World Prison Brief can yield valuable insights.
- An option is to consider reaching out to legal experts or academic institutions specializing in international law concerning prison rights.
