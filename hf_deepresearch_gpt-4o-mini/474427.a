Domestic abuse is a critical global issue affecting millions, particularly women, with approximately 736 million women experiencing physical and/or sexual violence worldwide. Various forms of domestic abuse, including physical, emotional, sexual, financial, psychological, and technological abuse, reveal the complex nature of this issue.

Key psychological factors include a history of violence and mental health issues that can entrap both victims and perpetrators, while sociological influences such as economic stress and cultural norms contribute significantly to the prevalence of domestic abuse.

To address this pervasive issue, it is vital to enhance community support systems, develop educational initiatives targeting vulnerable populations, and encourage more effective reporting and legal protection mechanisms for victims.

Understanding these factors is essential for developing effective interventions to eradicate domestic violence and support those affected.
