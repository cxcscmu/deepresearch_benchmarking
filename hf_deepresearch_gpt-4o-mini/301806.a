# Report on the Changes in Foreign Policy Over Time

## Introduction
Foreign policy encompasses the strategies and decisions made by governments to manage relations with other countries. Over time, foreign policy has evolved significantly across different nations, shaped by historical events, treaties, and contemporary global dynamics. This report examines the changes in foreign policy in four major entities: the United States, Russia, China, and the European Union (EU).

## 1. Historical Changes in Foreign Policy by Region

### 1.1 United States
- **Isolationism (1790s-1910s)**: The early U.S. foreign policy was marked by a desire to avoid European conflicts, exemplified by the Monroe Doctrine, which opposed European colonialism in the Americas.
- **Interventionism (1910s-1940s)**: The U.S. shifted towards intervention during World War I, leading to its dominance in post-WWII international order.
- **Cold War and Containment (1947-1991)**: U.S. foreign policy focused on containing communism, resulting in various international policies, including the Truman Doctrine and military alliances such as NATO.
- **Globalization and War on Terror (1991-Present)**: After the Cold War, the U.S. embraced globalization, increasing its involvement in global trade while also responding to terrorism post-9/11.

### 1.2 Russia
- **Tsarist Era (1721-1917)**: Characterized by expansionist ambitions seeking to increase territory and power in Europe and Asia through various conflicts.
- **Soviet Era (1917-1991)**: Shifts from initial isolationism under Lenin to prominent international engagement under Stalin and during the Cold War, aiming to spread communism.
- **Post-Soviet Era (1991-Present)**: A return to assertive foreign policy under Putin, exemplified by military actions in Ukraine and a focus on reestablishing influence in former Soviet territories.

### 1.3 China
- **Imperial Era (Before 1912)**: Focused on Confucian diplomacy with an isolationist stance limiting engagement with Western powers.
- **Republican Era (1912-1949)**: Transitioned to a defensive foreign policy amid increasing foreign influences post-Qing Dynasty.
- **People's Republic of China (1949-Present)**: Initially emphasized socialist ideology, later shifting to pragmatism and global engagement through economic policies, including the Belt and Road Initiative.

### 1.4 European Union
- **Formation and Treaties (1990s-Present)**: Beginning with economic cooperation, the EU's foreign policy evolved through treaties such as Maastricht (1992), Amsterdam (1999), and Lisbon (2009), establishing a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).
- **Modern Challenges**: Influenced by regional conflicts, migration crises, and geopolitical factors including Brexit, emphasizing the complexities and necessary adaptations of the EUâ€™s foreign policy.

## 2. Key Treaties Influencing Foreign Policy
Each of the entities has seen foreign policy shaped by significant treaties:
- **United States**: The Monroe Doctrine, the Treaty of Versailles, and NATO Treaty delineate pivotal moments and shifts in policy. 
- **Russia**: Treaties like the Treaty of Nystad and the Warsaw Pact influenced territorial and geopolitical strategies.
- **China**: From the Treaty of Nanking to its WTO Accession, treaties have opened and defined its foreign engagements.
- **European Union**: Key treaties like the Maastricht and Lisbon have institutionalized processes and capacities for EU foreign relations.

## 3. Contemporary Issues Affecting Foreign Policy
Modern challenges shape foreign policies significantly:
- **United States**: Issues such as globalization, climate change, and rising powers (notably China) dictate strategic realignments.
- **Russia**: Sanctions and military expansion necessitate a more aggressive stance in foreign affairs.
- **China**: The Belt and Road Initiative aims to expand influence, alongside challenges posed by trade wars and territorial disputes.
- **European Union**: The implications of Brexit and humanitarian responses to global crises like migration highlight the need for cohesive policy responses.

## Conclusion
The evolution of foreign policy is a dynamic process influenced by historical contexts, domestic politics, major treaties, and contemporary global issues. The foreign policies of the United States, Russia, China, and the European Union have significantly changed over time, reflecting their respective responses to both internal challenges and international relations dynamics. Understanding these changes is crucial for navigating current geopolitical landscapes and anticipatory future developments.
