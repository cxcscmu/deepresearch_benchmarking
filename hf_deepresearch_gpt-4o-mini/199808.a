### Summary Report: Does Rehabilitation Reduce Crime?

#### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Restorative Justice**: Focuses on repairing harm caused by crime through inclusive engagement of victims, offenders, and the community.
- **Cognitive-Behavioral Theory**: Aims to change thinking patterns that influence criminal behavior.

- **Trauma-Informed Care**: Recognizes the role of trauma in shaping behaviors, advocating for supportive environments.

#### Public Perception
- Support for rehabilitation programs is present, but skepticism about leniency remains.
- Strengthening community support and showcasing success stories can improve public perception and, subsequently, funding.

#### Data Accessibility Challenges
- Current limitations have hindered gathering recent empirical studies on rehabilitation effectiveness.
- Recommendations include consulting academic sources and engaging with research institutions for further information.

#### Conclusion
- Rehabilitation is positioned as a beneficial approach to reduce crime through systematic integration rather than punitive measures. The active engagement of community and positive public perception is key to its success.
