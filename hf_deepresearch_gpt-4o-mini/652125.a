Gasoline vehicles are bad for the environment due to their significant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. They produce a variety of harmful pollutants that affect air quality and public health, and they have substantial lifecycle emissions, from manufacturing through operation to disposal. Current regulations aim to reduce these emissions, but the shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles is necessary to mitigate the environmental impact of gasoline cars.
