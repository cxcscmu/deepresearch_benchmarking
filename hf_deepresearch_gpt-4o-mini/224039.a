### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Cambodian genocide occurred from 1975 to 1979, led by the Khmer Rouge regime, resulting in the deaths of approximately 1.7 million people. The genocide ended when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in January 1979, leading to the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Cambodian genocide began in April 1975 when the Khmer Rouge, a communist group led by Pol Pot, seized power in Cambodia. They sought to create an agrarian socialist society, resulting in widespread elimination of perceived enemies, including intellectuals, professionals, and ethnic minorities. Key events include:

- **April 17, 1975**: The Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh, marking the start of their regime. 
- **1975-1976**: The regime implemented radical agrarian policies, forcibly relocating urban populations to rural areas. This caused mass starvation and suffering.
- **1976-1977**: Widespread purges occurred; many people were executed in what are now known as the Killing Fields.
- **1978**: The regime continued its brutal methods, leading to resistance and unrest.
- **December 25, 1978**: Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia following rising tensions and conflict along the border. 
- **January 7, 1979**: The Khmer Rouge was toppled, and the Vietnamese established a new government, effectively ending the genocide.

The aftermath involved significant humanitarian efforts and ongoing political struggles in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge leaders were later tried for their crimes against humanity in the late 1990s and 2000s.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The genocide resulted in immense trauma and loss in Cambodia. The legacy of the genocide continues to affect Cambodian society, politics, and culture today.
