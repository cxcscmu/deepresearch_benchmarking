# Report on Reasons for Overturning Roe v. Wade

## 1. Historical Context
Roe v. Wade was a groundbreaking 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion, framing it as part of a woman's right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision effectively invalidated numerous state laws restricting abortion and ignited a prolonged national debate over reproductive rights, deeply influencing political alignments within American parties.

The case arose from a Texas law that prohibited abortion except to save the mother's life, with Norma McCorvey, known by the pseudonym "Jane Roe," challenging the legality of this law. The ruling shaped the political and cultural landscape surrounding women's rights and bodily autonomy while reaffirming its legal standing in subsequent cases until it was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022.

Consulting organizations like Pew Research and Gallup will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.
