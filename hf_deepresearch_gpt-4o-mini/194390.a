{'Task outcome (short version)': 'Climate change significantly affects the environment, escalating extreme weather events, health crises, and food and water insecurity.', 'Task outcome (extremely detailed version)': {'1. Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events': 'Climate change has intensified instances of extreme weather such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires. For example, one report noted 41 additional days of dangerous heat in 2024 compared to previous years.', '2. Human Health Impacts': 'The World Health Organization outlines that climate change is directly contributing to health crises, with an escalating number of deaths due to heat stress, disease proliferation such as malaria, and food and water insecurity. An estimated 250,000 additional deaths per year may occur due to climate-related health issues in vulnerable populations.', '3. Ecosystem Disruption and Biodiversity Loss': 'Critical habitats for wildlife are changing, leading to increased risks of extinction for sensitive species. The degradation of biodiversity has wide-ranging consequences, affecting food chains and the resilience of ecosystems.', '4. Socioeconomic Consequences': 'Climate change induces economic damage that disproportionately affects low-income communities. Compounded effects of extreme weather disrupt food supply chains and local economies, leading to food shortages and water scarcity.', '5. Long-Term Projections': 'Experts suggest that significant additional impacts will arise unless proactive steps are taken to reduce emissions and better prepare global health systems. The urgency for international cooperation and local adaptation strategies is emphasized as necessary to address these interlinked crises.'}, 'Additional context': 'The synthesis of studies from Nature, IPCC, and WMO illustrates the interconnectedness of climate change impacts, showing the necessity for immediate action at both policy and community levels to effectively mitigate these challenges for future generations.'}
