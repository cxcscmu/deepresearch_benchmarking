### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Survival strategies employed by inmates in Auschwitz camp included forming social networks, sharing food and information, using deception, and sometimes engaging in acts of resistance.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In Auschwitz, inmates faced extreme conditions including starvation, forced labor, and brutality. To survive, they employed several strategies:

- **Social Networks:** Many inmates formed alliances and friendships to provide mutual support, share resources, and help each other cope psychologically with the harsh conditions.

- **Resourcefulness:** Inmates often had to be resourceful to obtain food. They would share whatever scarce food they managed to acquire, which sometimes included rationed bread or sharing hidden supplies.

- **Deception:** Some inmates employed deception to survive, such as pretending to be more capable workers to avoid being selected for extermination or crafting false identity documents to outwit guards.

- **Acts of Resistance:** While survival was the priority, some individuals also engaged in acts of resistance, such as sabotaging machinery or attempting to smuggle messages outside the camp. These acts were incredibly dangerous but signify a fierce will to survive and resist oppression.

- **Coping Mechanisms:** Psychological survival was equally essential. Inmates often focused on small goals, like surviving another day or maintaining hope through shared stories or memories of their lives before the camp.

### 3. Additional Context:
The survival of individuals in Auschwitz highlights the human spirit's resilience in the face of unimaginable adversity. The strategies employed by inmates were not only about physical survival but also about maintaining one's dignity and humanity in dehumanizing conditions.
