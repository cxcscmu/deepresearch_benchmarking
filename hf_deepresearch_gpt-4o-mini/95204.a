#### 1. Short Summary
Fugitives often employ various techniques and strategies to survive while on the run, which include evasion tactics, securing resources, maintaining a low profile, and using technology to their advantage.

#### 2. Detailed Insights
Fugitives face numerous challenges while on the run, leading them to adopt various survival strategies:

1. **Evasion Techniques**: 
   - **Changing Locations Regularly**: To avoid detection, fugitives frequently change their location. This may involve moving from one city to another or even between states.
   - **Using Disguises**: Fugitives may alter their appearance, possibly changing hairstyles or clothing styles to blend in with different environments.
   - **Avoiding Established Patterns**: They often develop unpredictable routines to prevent law enforcement from anticipating their next moves.

2. **Securing Resources**: 
   - **Using Cash**: Fugitives might avoid credit cards or bank transactions to prevent traceability. Paying in cash helps maintain anonymity.
   - **Finding Shelter**: They may seek shelter in less conspicuous places, such as campgrounds, abandoned buildings, or with contacts who won't draw attention to them.

3. **Maintaining a Low Profile**: 
   - **Minimizing Social Interaction**: Many fugitives limit their social contacts and avoid creating new relationships that could lead to their capture.
   - **Communication Blackout**: They may avoid phones or the internet to reduce the risk of being tracked.

4. **Utilizing Technology**: 
   - **Cryptographic Apps**: Some fugitives may use encrypted messaging applications to communicate securely.
   - **Fake Identifications**: They might acquire false identities to evade capture.

#### 3. Additional Context
While the above techniques are commonly observed, the success of a fugitive's strategy often depends on various factors including law enforcement resources, public vigilance, and personal ingenuity. The life of a fugitive is generally fraught with danger and uncertainty, making survival a daily challenge.
