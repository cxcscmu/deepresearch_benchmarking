### 1. Task outcome (short version):
I was unable to retrieve specific studies or data regarding the effectiveness of working from home in China due to lack of access to online research resources.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Despite multiple attempts to search for relevant studies or reports on the productivity and effectiveness of working from home during the pandemic in China, all attempts were unsuccessful due to frequent errors related to insufficient credits for conducting web searches. 

It is important to note that remote work has gained significant attention globally, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, with various studies published on productivity, employee satisfaction, and mental health effects associated with remote work. However, in the context of China, the specific data points and key findings attributable to Chinese workers or firms were not accessible in the current environment.

To better understand this topic, I recommend seeking access to academic databases that may host such studies or reviewing government publications or HR reports focusing on the impact of remote work practices in China during the pandemic. Additionally, exploring social media or corporate reports could shed light on how Chinese employees perceive working from home.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Without concrete data or studies to reference, this outlook lacks the necessary empirical backing. If you have specific queries or additional parameters for the search, please provide them, and I will attempt to refine the search based on your guidance.
