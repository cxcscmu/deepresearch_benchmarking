### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Current statistics on the percentage of women who are pro-choice in 2023 are currently unavailable due to limitations in retrieving online data.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
I attempted multiple searches for the current statistics regarding the percentage of women who are pro-choice for the year 2023. Unfortunately, I faced repeated limitations related to insufficient credits for conducting web searches. As a result, I was unable to access specific surveys or studies that would provide numerical data on the topic from reputable sources. Without access to this data, I can't provide an accurate percentage.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
For future reference, reputable sources for abortion-related statistics typically include organizations such as the Guttmacher Institute, Pew Research Center, or public health departments. In light of my current limitations, I recommend checking these sources for the most recent data on women's attitudes toward pro-choice issues. If needed, I can assist further once the issues with data access are resolved.
