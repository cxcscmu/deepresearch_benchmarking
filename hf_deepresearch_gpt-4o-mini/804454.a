### Definition of Velocity of Money
The velocity of money is an economic measure that quantifies the rate at which money circulates in an economy. It is calculated as the ratio of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the money supply. A higher velocity indicates that money is changing hands rapidly, while a lower velocity suggests that money is being saved rather than spent.

### Historical Data Overview
The historical data for the velocity of M2 Money Stock from 2013 to 2023 indicates fluctuations:
- **2013**: Approximate velocity around 1.48.
- **2020**: The velocity potentially dropped below 1.2 due to economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **2023**: Latest available velocity estimates around 1.36.

For detailed data, users can visit the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website's M2V series [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V).

### Influencing Factors
Several factors contribute to changes in the velocity of money, including:
1. **Consumer Confidence**: Higher confidence encourages spending, increasing velocity.
2. **Economic Conditions**: Growth boosts circulation; recessions lead to increased saving and decreased velocity.
3. **Interest Rates**: Lower rates tend to increase velocity through encouraging borrowing and spending.
4. **Inflation**: Rising inflation may lead to higher velocity, as consumers spend before money's value diminishes.
5. **Technological Changes**: Advances in payment technologies can facilitate quicker transactions.
6. **Banking Practices**: Credit availability impacts how quickly money circulates.

### Significant Economic Events
Some significant global occurrences that may have affected the velocity of money include:
- Economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Trade tensions, particularly between the US and China.
- Inflationary pressures resulting from global supply chain disruptions.
- The rise of remote work influencing consumer behavior.
- Changes in monetary policies by central banks in response to economic challenges.

### Conclusion
The decline in the velocity of money from 2013 to 2023 can be attributed to multifaceted factors, including economic downturns, changes in consumer confidence, and external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these elements is crucial for policymakers aiming to stimulate economic growth and manage inflation effectively.
