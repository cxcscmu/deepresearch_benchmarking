### Reasons for the Rise in Petrol Prices

1. **Global Oil Supply and Demand**: The balance between oil production and consumption is a key factor. Currently, if production drops or demand spikes, we can expect prices to rise.

2. **Geopolitical Tensions**: Ongoing conflicts in oil-producing regions disrupt supply chains. For example, tensions in the Middle East and sanctions on countries like Russia significantly impact prices.

3. **Economic Conditions**: The health of the global economy greatly affects petrol prices. An expanding economy usually leads to increased demand for petrol, raising prices.

4. **Refining Capacity**: Constraints in refining could arise from maintenance issues or regulatory changes. This could limit the available supply and drive prices up.

5. **Seasonal Demand Variations**: Fluctuations in demand due to seasonal activities (like summer travel) can lead to price increases.

6. **Market Speculation**: Speculative trading in oil markets, influenced by investor sentiment and news, can lead to price fluctuations regardless of actual supply and demand conditions.

### Conclusion

The interplay of these factors explains the current trends in petrol prices. For specific price data and future trends, consulting financial news and energy departments is recommended.
