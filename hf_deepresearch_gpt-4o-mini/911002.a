### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Despite challenges in accessing academic articles, it is clear that beauty standards across cultures show significant variability and influence individual identity and societal norms.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Beauty standards are not static; they evolve and adapt according to cultural, social, and economic factors. They have implications on mental health and self-esteem, reflecting historical contexts that shape today's beauty ideals. Most beauty standards emphasize certain physical attributes that can lead to societal pressure and mental health issues. 

The representation in media and popular culture also plays a crucial role in shaping these standards, often causing individuals to conform to unrealistic ideals. It can lead to a lack of representation for diverse body types, ethnicities, and styles, impacting how individuals feel about their appearance. Movement towards inclusivity in beauty standards is growing yet still faces resistance in many traditional settings.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The current push for more inclusive beauty standards advocates for recognition of diverse identities, challenging the norms that dominate the beauty industry. Various movements, such as body positivity and diverse representation in fashion campaigns, work towards changing perceptions of beauty.

Studies have shown that inclusive beauty standards lead to increased self-esteem and body satisfaction among individuals who feel represented. These movements reflect broader social dynamics, pushing for acceptance of various forms of beauty that reflect individuality over conformity to traditional standards.

In conclusion, the ongoing conversation about beauty standards highlights the importance of inclusivity and the mental health ramifications associated with prevailing ideals. The case for more inclusive beauty standards is supported by both social movements and emerging research highlighting their positive impacts.
