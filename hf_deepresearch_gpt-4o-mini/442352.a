**Is It Ethical to Use Animals for Medical and Cosmetic Testing?**

1. **Current Laws and Regulations:**
   - **USA:**
     - Governed by the Animal Welfare Act, which does not cover all animals and lacks specific prohibitions against animal testing for cosmetics.
   - **EU:**
     - Stricter regulations (REACH, EU Cosmetics Regulation) that prohibit animal testing for cosmetics and encourage alternatives to minimize animal use.

2. **Statistical Overview:**
   - Current statistics on animal testing practices were unable to be retrieved, indicating a barrier to understanding the actual scale of testing.

3. **Ethical Frameworks:**
   - **Utilitarianism:**
     - Advocates for testing if the benefits to human health outweigh the suffering caused to animals, which raises moral concerns about justifying harm for potential human benefit.
   - **Animal Rights Theories:**
     - Argue against testing by asserting that animals possess rights similar to humans and that harming them for testing purposes is inherently unethical regardless of potential benefits.

4. **Conclusions:**
   - The ethical debate around animal testing is multifaceted, involving conflicting interests between animal welfare and human benefits. The law's stance varies widely between regions, reflecting a broader societal view that is progressively shifting towards animal rights advocacy.

5. **Future Directions:**
   - Continued development of alternative testing methods and increasing public awareness could lead to changing regulations and reduced reliance on animal testing overall.
