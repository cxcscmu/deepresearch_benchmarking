   - **Infrastructure:** Adequate infrastructure (transport, telecommunication, utilities) is necessary for efficient business operations.

2. **Political Factors:**  
   - **Political Stability:** A stable political environment reduces risks associated with investments, making countries more attractive for FDI.
   - **Regulatory Framework:** Clear and transparent regulations encourage FDI. Investors seek countries with favorable taxation and few restrictions on profit repatriation.
