### Money Laundering Report

#### 1. Definition
Money laundering is the process of concealing the origins of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers involving foreign banks or legitimate businesses.

#### 2. Stages of Money Laundering
Money laundering involves three primary stages:
1. **Placement:** This stage involves introducing the illicit funds into the financial system. Common methods include: 
   - Cash deposits
   - Purchases of assets
   - Use of casinos for gambling
2. **Layering:** In this stage, the money is moved through a complex series of transactions to obscure its illegal origin. Techniques often employed in layering include:
   - Overseas transfers
   - Creation of shell companies
   - Transactions through legitimate businesses
3. **Integration:** This final stage reintroduces the laundered money into the economy, making it appear as though it was obtained legally.
