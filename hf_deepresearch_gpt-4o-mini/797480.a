## How Has Mental Health Changed Over the Years?

### 1. Legislation and Policy Changes
- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: Aimed to deinstitutionalize mental health care by moving patients into community care.
- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008)**: Required equal treatment limits for mental health benefits as for other medical benefits.
- **Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)**: Prohibited discrimination against individuals with mental health conditions, fostering greater societal acceptance.

### 2. Societal Attitudes
Due to tool limitations, I could not locate specific studies or surveys. However, it is suggested that societal attitudes towards mental health have shifted towards increased acceptance based on relevant legislation.

### 3. Prevalence Statistics
Similar limitations were faced in retrieving specific prevalence statistics of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety from reputable sources.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
- Utilize professional databases or websites directly to access relevant reports.
- Seek assistance from colleagues for access to specific research papers.
- Advocate for improved access to more extensive research tools for future inquiries.
