## How Does Global Warming Happen?

### 1. Definition
Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which increases greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

### 2. The Greenhouse Effect
- The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) absorb infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface. 
- Instead of allowing heat to escape back into space, these gases re-radiate the heat in all directions, including back to the surface, leading to higher surface temperatures.

### 3. Human Contribution
- Major human activities like industrialization, transportation, agriculture, and urban development significantly increase GHG emissions.
- Deforestation reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2, exacerbating the issue.

### 4. Feedback Mechanisms
- As global warming progresses, it can trigger feedback loops. For example, melting ice reduces the Earth’s reflectivity (albedo), leading to further warming, and warmer temperatures can increase methane release from permafrost.

### 5. Consequences
- The rise in global temperatures leads to severe weather events, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, and biodiversity loss. These changes can have profound impacts on ecosystems and human health.

### 6. Potential Solutions
- Strategies to mitigate global warming effects include reducing fossil fuel use, transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and engaging in reforestation efforts.

### 7. Conclusion
Understanding global warming is vital for developing effective environmental policies and making informed personal choices that contribute to climate change mitigation.
