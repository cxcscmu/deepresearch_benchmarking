### How Hinduism Began

Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world, with origins tracing back to the Indus Valley civilization around 2500-1500 BCE. It is characterized by a rich tapestry of beliefs, practices, and philosophical schools that evolved over more than three millennia. 

#### 1. Origins of Hinduism:

- **Vedic Period (c. 1500-500 BCE)**: 
  This era followed the decline of the Indus Valley civilization and marked the arrival of Indo-Aryan tribes who composed the Vedas, regarded as significant religious texts that laid the foundation of Hindu beliefs.

#### 2. Key Historical Figures:
