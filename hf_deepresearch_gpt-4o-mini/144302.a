# Report: How Vaccination Protects Others

## Introduction
Vaccination is a crucial public health intervention that not only protects individuals but also contribues to the protection of communities as a whole. This report synthesizes the evidence surrounding how being vaccinated protects others, focusing on mechanisms of action, herd immunity, and the impact on community health.

## 1. Mechanisms of Action
Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens, leading to immunity. When a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, herd immunity is achieved, protecting those who are unvaccinated. 

### Vaccine Types
There are several types of vaccines:
- **Live Attenuated Vaccines**: Weakened forms of the pathogen (e.g., MMR vaccine).
- **Inactivated Vaccines**: Killed pathogens (e.g., inactivated poliovirus).
- **Subunit, Recombinant, or Conjugate Vaccines**: Parts of the pathogen (e.g., HPV vaccine).
- **mRNA Vaccines**: Teach cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response (e.g., Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines).

## 2. Herd Immunity
Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, effectively limiting its spread. 

### Herd Immunity Thresholds
- **COVID-19**: Approximately **70-90%** of the population needs to be vaccinated or immune.
- **Measles**: Requires about **95%** due to its highly contagious nature.

## 3. Impact on Vulnerable Populations
Vaccination helps protect individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants, the elderly, or immunocompromised individuals, by reducing the overall incidence of disease through herd immunity.

## 4. Evidence of Reduced Transmission
While specific studies were not retrieved in this effort, literature generally supports the notion that vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit infections compared to those who are unvaccinated.

## Conclusion
Achieving high vaccination rates is essential not only for individual health but also for protecting communities and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. Vaccination campaigns that enhance coverage rates play a critical role in public health. 

This synthesis indicates that being vaccinated safeguards both the individual and the larger environment against communicable diseases.
