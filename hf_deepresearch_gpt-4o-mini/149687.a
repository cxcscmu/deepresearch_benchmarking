While specific current inflation rates could not be retrieved due to tool limitations, it is noted that inflation has been affected significantly in the past year due to multiple factors.

### 2. Key Factors Influencing Inflation:
- **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The ongoing repercussions from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to hinder supply chains, leading to manufacturing slowdowns and logistics challenges, which have resulted in shortages of various goods.

- **Increased Energy Prices:** Global fluctuations in energy markets, particularly regarding oil and gas prices, have significantly risen due to geopolitical tensions, affecting transportation and production costs.

- **Monetary Policy Adjustments:** Central banks, most notably the Federal Reserve in the US, have modified interest rates in response to inflation pressures, which influences borrowing costs and indirectly reduces consumer spending capacities.

- **Wage Growth:** In some sectors, tight labor markets have resulted in increased wages, thereby influencing business operational costs, leading to higher prices.

- **Consumer Demand:** High levels of consumer demand fueled by previous stimulus measures have outpaced certain supplies, contributing to continuous price increases.
