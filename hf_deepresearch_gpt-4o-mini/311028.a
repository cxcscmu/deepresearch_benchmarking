### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change significantly impacts agricultural productivity and food supply through changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and increased occurrences of extreme weather events. This leads to decreased crop yields, altered growing seasons, and food security challenges.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change affects agricultural productivity in various ways, including:
- **Temperature Changes**: Rising temperatures can accelerate crop maturation, reduce yields, and impact quality. Some crops may experience heat stress, leading to lower productivity.
- **Altered Precipitation Patterns**: Changes in rainfall can lead to droughts or flooding, both of which adversely affect crops. Droughts can limit water availability for irrigation, while excess rainfall can wash away nutrients.
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Increased frequency of events such as hurricanes, storms, and frost can devastate crops and disrupt planting and harvesting cycles.
- **Pest and Disease Pressure**: Warmer climates can extend the range and breeding seasons of pests and agricultural diseases, compounding yield losses. 
- **Soil Quality**: Climate change can lead to soil degradation, affecting its fertility and erosion rates, further impacting productivity.

In summary, climate change poses a multifaceted threat to agriculture, affecting not just crop yields but also the stability of food systems and supply chains.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing mitigation strategies, adapting agricultural practices, and ensuring food security in the upcoming decades.
