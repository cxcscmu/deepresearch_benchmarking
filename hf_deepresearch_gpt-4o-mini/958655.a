Based on comprehensive research, it is evident that religion should not have a place in government. Historical examples suggest that intertwining religion with governance leads to discrimination and undermines democratic principles. Contemporary legal frameworks further validate this, demonstrating risks of favoring specific religions, which leads to societal division. Therefore, maintaining a clear separation between religion and government is essential for upholding human rights and ensuring equality for all individuals.
