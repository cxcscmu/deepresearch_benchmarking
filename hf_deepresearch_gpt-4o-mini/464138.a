The 1840 World’s Anti-Slavery Convention, held in London, was a pivotal event that highlighted the interconnectedness of the abolitionist movement and the early women’s rights movement. Organized by key figures such as Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the convention not only called for the abolition of slavery but also advocated for women’s rights.

2. **Foundational Ideas**: 
   - The discussions and resolutions influenced the emergence of the women’s suffrage movement, leading to later events like the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Here, the "Declaration of Sentiments" articulated a call for women’s suffrage, echoing the sentiments shared at the anti-slavery convention.
