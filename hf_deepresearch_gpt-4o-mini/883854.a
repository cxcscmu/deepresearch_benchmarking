### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Fascism emerged in Italy and Germany due to socio-economic turmoil following World War I, characterized by authoritarian rule and nationalism, leading to key events that precipitated World War II.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In Italy, fascism rose after World War I amid significant economic instability, national humiliation, and social unrest. Benito Mussolini established the National Fascist Party in 1921, capitalizing on widespread discontent. The March on Rome in 1922 marked Mussoliniâ€™s rise to power, gradually transitioning Italy into a totalitarian state.

In Germany, the aftermath of World War I resulted in the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh reparations, contributing to economic hardship and political instability. Adolf Hitler capitalized on these sentiments, becoming Chancellor in 1933 and implementing the Nazi regime, which pursued aggressive expansionist policies and intense nationalism.

Key events leading to World War II included Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Germany's remilitarization of the Rhineland (1936), the annexation of Austria (Anschluss, 1938), and the invasion of Poland in 1939, which triggered the war.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Fascism in both nations utilized propaganda, militarism, and suppression of dissent to maintain control, and its aggressive expansionism was a significant factor in the global conflict of World War II.
