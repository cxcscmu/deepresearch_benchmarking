### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Due to limitations in accessing external data sources, I am unable to gather specific metrics or trends regarding customer inquiries related to late shipments.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
I attempted to perform multiple web searches to acquire detailed information on customer inquiries and trends related to late shipments. However, all attempts failed because of insufficient credits for executing the web search function. This indicates that I cannot access the necessary external reports or studies that typically provide insights into customer behaviors concerning late shipments.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Given the challenges in accessing direct data, I recommend alternative approaches:
1. **Internal Analysis:** If available, review internal customer service logs or CRM systems for trends in inquiries about late shipments over time.
2. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Utilize existing customer feedback surveys or complaints data from recent interactions to identify trends.
3. **Social Media Monitoring:** Analyze mentions of late shipments on social platforms which might provide anecdotal evidence of customer sentiment.
4. **Industry Reports:** Look for recent industry reports or case studies available through industry associations or logistics firms that might provide insights without the web search function.
