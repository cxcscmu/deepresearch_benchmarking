### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The invasion of Poland by Germany began on September 1, 1939. This event marked the start of World War II, as it prompted the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany shortly thereafter.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The invasion of Poland commenced at 4:45 AM on September 1, 1939, when Germany launched a massive attack that featured a rapid combination of air and ground forces utilizing the Blitzkrieg strategy, characterized by speed and surprise. This marked the beginning of open hostilities in World War II.  
The background context includes several key events leading up to the invasion. After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 imposed severe restrictions on Germany, creating deep resentment among its populace. Economic instability, hyperinflation, and the effects of the Great Depression led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, who promised to restore Germany to its former glory.  
In the lead-up to the invasion, Hitler sought to revise the territorial losses imposed by the Treaty and pursued a policy of aggressive expansionism. The Nazi regime's ambitions included annexing territories with significant ethnic German populations and ensuring "Lebensraum" (living space) for Germans. Prior to invading Poland, Germany had consolidated its position through the remilitarization of the Rhineland (1936), the annexation of Austria (Anschluss, 1938), and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement (1938).  
To facilitate the invasion, Germany sought a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, culminating in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on August 23, 1939, which secretly divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. This agreement ensured that if Germany invaded Poland, the Soviet Union would not intervene.  
As a direct consequence of Germany's swift victory and occupation of Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, officially starting World War II. The invasion led to the swift collapse of Polish defenses, the division of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union, and set off a series of military campaigns across Europe.
