### Final Report on the Effects of the Cold War Today

---

**I. Geopolitical Influences**
1. **Ukraine Conflict**: The ongoing tension in Ukraine, especially after the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, reflects Cold War ideological divides. NATO's support for Ukraine is symbolic of the historical context of U.S.-led alliances against a backdrop of Russian influence reminiscent of the Soviet era.

2. **Middle East Conflicts**: The U.S. and Russiaâ€™s involvement in Middle Eastern politics, forming alliances and supporting different factions, continues to create proxy conflicts that echo Cold War geopolitics. Regions like Syria and Iraq show the complexities of these Cold War legacies.

3. **North Korea's Standoff**: The existing tensions between North and South Korea, along with U.S. involvement, are also rooted in Cold War-era policies. North Korea's nuclear ambitions reflect its historical alliances with China and Russia, challenging Western interests.

**II. Societal Movements**
1. **LGBTQ Rights Movement**: A movement that emerged and gained visibility during the Cold War due to persecution, framing contemporary advocacy work within this historical context.

2. **Anti-War Movements**: Drawing from the protests against the Vietnam War, current anti-war activism often uses Cold War narratives as a framework for critiquing ongoing military engagements.

3. **Labor Movements**: Reflecting historical struggles magnified during the Cold War, labor movements today continue to advocate for workers' rights while referencing Cold War-era ideologies of capitalism and communism.

**III. Technological Advancements**
1. **Satellite Technology**: Innovations developed for military espionage have evolved and are now integral to global communications, disaster response, and navigation.

2. **The Internet**: Originally an initiative for secure military communications (ARPANET), the internet has revolutionized information access and communication in the digital age.

3. **Nuclear Technology**: Advancements in nuclear technology have implications not just for military power but also for global energy policy and international relations.

4. **Computing and Aerospace Technologies**: The foundations laid during the Cold War in computing (early computers and algorithms) and aerospace technologies have shaped industries today, from healthcare to space exploration.

**Conclusion**
The Cold War's legacy continues to shape contemporary global dynamics, societal movements, and technological advancements. The ideological battles and conflicts of that era provide a context for understanding current issues in geopolitics, social justice, and technological progress. Recognizing these connections helps both activists and scholars to navigate and address today's challenges more effectively.
