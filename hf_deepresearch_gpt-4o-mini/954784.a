### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of late-life divorce on women's emotional and psychological adjustment often leads to significant challenges including emotional distress and adjustment difficulties.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Late-life divorce, occurring typically after many years of marriage, has been shown to have profound effects on women. As they navigate the complexities of life post-divorce, several key impacts emerge:

1. **Emotional Distress:** 
   - Women may experience a range of emotions including sadness, anxiety, and anger. The end of a long-term marriage can lead to feelings of loss and grief.
   - Many women report heightened levels of depression during the adjustment phase, which can persist long after the divorce.

2. **Psychological Adjustment:**  
   - Adjustment to single life can be challenging. Women may struggle with loneliness and find it hard to rebuild their social networks.
   - The transition often entails redefining their identity outside of marriage, which can be a source of stress.

3. **Financial Security:**  
   - Late-life divorce can significantly impact women's financial stability, leading to anxiety regarding their standard of living and future security.
   - Adjusting to potentially lower income and managing new financial responsibilities can contribute to emotional distress.

4. **Social Support Systems:**  
   - Women often experience changes in their social circles post-divorce. Relationships with friends and family can be strained.
   - Establishing new support systems is crucial for emotional well-being. However, many women find this difficult as they age.

5. **Coping Mechanisms:**  
   - Research highlights that women employ various coping strategies, such as seeking therapy or joining support groups, to help navigate the emotional aftermath of divorce. 
   - Engaging in social activities and hobbies can also serve as beneficial outlets for emotional expression and connection.

6. **Long-term Adjustment:**  
   - Over time, many women do find a new sense of normalcy and happiness after divorce, often rediscovering personal goals and ambitions that may have been sidelined during marriage.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Despite the initial challenges, many women reported that divorce allowed them to reclaim autonomy and pursue interests that were previously neglected. As such, while the adjustment process can be fraught with difficulties, it can also open opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery.
