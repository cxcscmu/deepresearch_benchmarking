## 1. Definition of Cyclical Unemployment
Cyclical unemployment is unemployment that occurs due to economic downturns, where demand for goods and services decreases, leading to layoffs and a temporary reduction in employment levels. It is characterized by fluctuations in unemployment that correspond to the economic cycle of growth and recession.

## 2. Policy Tools for Addressing Cyclical Unemployment
The following policy tools are commonly used to address cyclical unemployment:
1. **Monetary Policy**: 
   - Lowering interest rates and quantitative easing to stimulate borrowing and investments.
2. **Fiscal Policy**:
   - Increasing public spending and tax cuts to boost economic activity.
3. **Labor Market Policies**:
   - Enhancements to unemployment insurance and job search assistance programs.
4. **Education and Training Programs**:
   - Investing in skills development to prepare workers for emerging job opportunities.
