### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The 'sense of self' in psychology refers to an individual's perception and understanding of themselves, which can be informed by various psychological theories and frameworks.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The 'sense of self' is a complex concept in psychology that encompasses how individuals perceive their identity, personality, and existence. It involves self-awareness, self-recognition, and self-esteem. Various psychologists have developed theories that expand on this concept:

- **William James** introduced a distinction between the 'I' (the self as the subject of experience) and the 'Me' (the self as an object of experience), emphasizing the multiple dimensions of self. 
- **Carl Rogers** emphasized the idea of the self-concept, which he described as the individual's perceptions of themselves that are influenced by their experiences and interactions. He believed that the ideal self and the real self must be aligned for a person to achieve personal growth and fulfillment.
- **Erik Eriksonâ€™s** psychosocial development theory outlines stages in which the development of the sense of self is closely tied to social relationships and experiences across the lifespan, particularly in adolescence.
- **George Herbert Mead** discussed the social construction of self, highlighting that the self is developed through social interactions and the internalization of societal norms and expectations.
- **Self-Determination Theory**, developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, includes the sense of self in its emphasis on intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation and how individuals' needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence their self-perception.

The 'sense of self' is also impacted by external factors and can evolve over time due to experiences, relationships, and societal influences. It plays a crucial role in mental health and well-being, shaping motivations, relationships, and overall life satisfaction.
