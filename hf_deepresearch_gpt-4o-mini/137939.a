### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Obesity has significantly increased over the last few decades, and it became recognized as a serious public health issue starting in the late 20th century, leading to various societal changes in health policies and awareness campaigns.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Historically, obesity rates have been steadily rising since the 1960s, with significant increases observed in the 1980s and 1990s. The recognition of obesity as a public health issue began gaining traction in the late 20th century, highlighted by key reports from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 1997, the WHO included obesity in its International Classification of Diseases, marking a pivotal point in its recognition as a health concern. 

The societal changes that accompanied this recognition included increased public health campaigns focused on diet and exercise, policy changes aimed at promoting healthier food environments, and the introduction of regulations such as calorie labeling in restaurants and schools. The stigma surrounding obesity also began to change as awareness grew regarding its complex nature involving genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Major health organizations, including the American Medical Association, began classifying obesity as a disease in 2013, further solidifying its status as a public health issue.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Obesity is linked to numerous health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, which has propelled it to the forefront of public health discussions. Understanding the historical context of obesity can inspire further actions and policies to address this ongoing epidemic.
