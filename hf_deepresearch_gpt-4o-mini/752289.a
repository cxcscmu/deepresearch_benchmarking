### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Common reasons for delays in IRS tax refunds include errors or incomplete information on tax returns, identity theft or fraud issues, and claims for certain tax credits.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Delays in IRS tax refunds can be attributed to several factors:
- **Errors on or Incomplete Tax Returns**: Simple mistakes such as missing signatures, mathematical errors, or discrepancies between reported income and third-party records can delay processing. The IRS may reach out for clarification or additional information, causing further delays.
- **Identity Theft and Fraud Issues**: If the IRS flags a return due to suspected identity theft, it will undergo additional review. Tax-related identity theft can halt the processing of a refund until the situation is resolved. Affected taxpayers may receive IRS letters requesting verification.
- **Claims for Specific Tax Credits**: Tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), may extend the refund processing time, especially if details related to the claim are inaccurate or missing. Correspondence from the IRS often outlines the steps the taxpayer should take.
- **Previous Debts**: Refunds may be offset to satisfy prior tax liabilities or other debts such as child support. A notice will typically be sent if this occurs.
- **Review Delays**: If a tax return is selected for review, it may take an additional 45 to 180 days for the IRS to process, depending on the issues raised.
- **Lost or Stolen Refunds**: In cases where the refund appears to have been issued but is not received, issues may include incorrect bank account details or loss in transit. Taxpayers can request the IRS to trace the refund to investigate this further.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The IRS recommends using the "Where's My Refund?" tool for the most accurate updates on refund statuses, updated every 24 hours. Taxpayers should avoid calling the IRS unless specifically requested to do so during the application process or if they receive communication from the IRS.
