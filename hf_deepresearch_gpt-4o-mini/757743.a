### Radical Republicans' Disapproval of Presidential Reconstruction

1. **Overview**
   - Presidential Reconstruction, initiated by Presidents Lincoln and Johnson from 1865-1867, focused on rapidly reintegrating the Southern states into the Union after the Civil War. Radical Republicans opposed this approach, believing it failed to protect the rights of newly freed African Americans.

2. **Core Beliefs of Radical Republicans**
   - The Radical Republicans were committed to the complete abolition of slavery, civil rights for African Americans, and sought to punish former Confederates. They believed in active federal intervention for the protection of civil rights.

3. **Criticisms of Presidential Reconstruction**
   - **Leniency Towards the South**: Radical Republicans criticized Andrew Johnson’s approach as excessively lenient, allowing former Confederate leaders to regain power without holding them accountable.
   - **Ignoring Freedmen’s Rights**: Johnson’s policies largely sidelined the rights of freed slaves, leading to resentment among Radical Republicans who pushed for federal protections.
   - **Veto of Civil Rights Legislation**: Johnson vetoed crucial legislation aimed at safeguarding African American rights, which infuriated Radical Republicans and led them to override his veto.
   - **Undermining Reconstruction Efforts**: They believed his lenient policies would lead to the re-establishment of the old Southern order, negating the progress made during the Civil War.

4. **Consequences of Disapproval**
   - The conflict between President Johnson and Radical Republicans escalated to the point of his impeachment in 1868. Following this, Radical Republicans managed to pass stricter Reconstruction Acts which imposed more stringent requirements for Southern states, fundamentally reshaping the approach to Reconstruction.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The disapproval of Radical Republicans towards Presidential Reconstruction highlighted significant political tensions during the Reconstruction era. This division not only shaped the immediate post-war policies but also laid a foundation for future civil rights movements in America.
