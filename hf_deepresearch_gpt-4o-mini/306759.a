## Long-Term Causes
1. **Nationalism**: Nationalistic fervor permeated European countries, leading to rivalries and a desire for stronger nation-states. Ethnic groups sought independence, and countries aimed to assert their dominance. For instance, Slavic nationalism in the Balkans contributed to tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.

2. **Militarism**: The arms race among European powers, particularly between Germany and Great Britain, led to increased military expenditures and the belief that military solutions could resolve conflicts. This buildup of arms would later facilitate the rapid mobilization of troops once war was declared.

3. **Imperialism**: Competition for colonies and resources around the world heightened tensions among the major European powers. The scramble for Africa and conflicts in Asia created rivalries and suspicions, particularly between nations such as Britain, France, and Germany.

4. **Alliances**: The complex web of alliances and treaties, such as the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain), meant that a local conflict could quickly escalate into a broader war. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand set off a chain reaction, as allied countries were drawn into the fighting due to these agreements.

## Short-Term Causes
1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (June 28, 1914)**: The heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, acting as an immediate catalyst for the war.

2. **July Crisis (July 1914)**: Following the assassination, a series of diplomatic moves escalated tensions. Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, leading to their declaration of war on July 28, 1914.

3. **System of Alliances**: The existing treaties and alliances meant that Austria-Hungary's declaration of war prompted Russia to mobilize for Serbia, which brought Germany and subsequently France into the conflict. Britain entered the war to oppose Germany after the invasion of Belgium.

4. **Nationalism and Militarism**: The rise of nationalism and militarism escalated tensions, with countries prepared for conflict and eager to assert dominance.

5. **Imperialistic Rivalries**: Competition for global influence created further friction, particularly in regions like Morocco and the Balkans.

## Conclusion
The combination of these long-term and short-term causes created a highly volatile environment leading to World War I. The interplay between these factors illustrates how fragile peace can be in a competitive international setting, ultimately leading to one of the deadliest conflicts in history.
