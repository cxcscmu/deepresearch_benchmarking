### Effect of Daily Twitter Use on Attention Span of Under-16s

### 1. Overview
This report investigates the relationship between daily Twitter use and the attention span of adolescents under 16 years of age.

### 2. Research Findings
1. **Impact of Twitter Use:** Recent academic studies indicate that frequent use of Twitter, as part of broader social media engagement, negatively affects the attention spans of adolescents, leading to decreased academic performance and increased distractibility. Specifically, a study from the University of Delaware highlights a correlation between excessive social media use and lower academic achievement.
2. **Twitter Usage Statistics:** Currently, approximately 17% of U.S. teens aged 13 to 17 report using Twitter (now known as X) as of late 2024, a notable decline from 23% in 2022 and significantly lower than 33% in 2014-2015. This decline reflects a broader trend of shifting preferences towards more visually-oriented platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
3. **Effects of Screen Time:** Research indicates that excessive screen time, averaging more than 8 hours per day among adolescents, contributes to attention deficits and symptoms resembling ADHD. Different types of screen use yield different effects, with passive consumption often linked to reduced sustained attention. High levels of screen engagement can deplete cognitive resources necessary for effective learning.

### 3. Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is evident that daily use of Twitter, alongside other types of screen engagement, poses risks to the attention spans of individuals under 16. Experts suggest limiting recreational screen time to fewer than 2 hours per day, encouraging activities that promote cognitive engagement without screens. Continued monitoring of social media usage patterns and their cognitive implications will be essential for parents and educators.
