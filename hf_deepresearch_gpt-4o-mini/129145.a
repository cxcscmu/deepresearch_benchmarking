Crude oil prices are rising due to several factors including geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, and OPEC's production decisions. However, the inability to access specific details on these events, alongside key economic indicators like inflation and growth forecasts, restricts a deeper analysis of why these price increases are occurring. Attempts to explore historical price trends for seasonal patterns also faced limitations. Consulting reliable news articles, energy agency reports, and direct data sources is recommended for a more thorough understanding.
