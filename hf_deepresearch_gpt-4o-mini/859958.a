### 1. Introduction
This report examines the roles of international trade agencies, particularly their impact on free trade and the criticisms surrounding their functions.

### 2. Roles of International Trade Agencies
International trade agencies, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank, play a crucial role in shaping international trade regulations by:
- **Setting Global Trade Rules**: Establishing rules governing international trade to promote smooth and predictable exchanges.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Providing formal mechanisms for resolving trade disputes between member countries.
- **Technical Assistance and Training**: Offering support to help developing nations understand and adhere to trade agreements.
- **Research and Data Collection**: Conducting analyses that guide nations in shaping their trade strategies.
- **Capacity Building**: Enhancing the trade capacity of developing nations through workshops and support programs.

### 3. Implications on Free Trade
Agencies that facilitate international trade influence free trade both positively by reducing barriers and negatively by enforcing regulations that some critics believe hinder free trade.

### 4. Criticisms
Critics argue that these agencies:
- Impose regulations that infringe on national sovereignty.
- Create an imbalance of benefits favoring wealthier nations over developing countries.
- Prioritize economic growth while neglecting environmental and social standards.
- Favor larger economies in dispute resolution processes.
- Lack transparency, leading to public mistrust.

### 5. Examples and Case Studies
- **The Doha Development Round**: Stalled negotiations that illustrate the imbalances between developed and developing nations.
- **Agricultural Subsidies**: Examples where subsidies in developed countries undermine developing nations' farmers.

### 6. Conclusion
Understanding the complexities and criticisms surrounding international trade agencies is essential for evaluating their overall effectiveness and fairness in promoting free trade.
