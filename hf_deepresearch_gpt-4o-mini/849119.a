# Evolution of Scientific Knowledge Over Time

## 1. Overview of Major Historical Periods
- **The Scientific Revolution (16th-17th Century)**: Marked a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas and practices, with the development of the scientific method by figures like Galileo and Newton.
- **The Enlightenment (18th Century)**: This period emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of traditional beliefs. Key figures such as Francis Bacon and René Descartes promoted empirical research and rational thought.
- **The Industrial Revolution (18th-19th Century)**: Significantly transformed science through technological advances, which led to new fields such as chemistry and engineering. Innovators like James Watt and Thomas Edison played pivotal roles.

## 2. Key Scientific Theories and Concepts
- **Heliocentrism**: Proposed by Copernicus, it challenged geocentric models and laid foundations for modern astronomy.
- **Newtonian Physics**: Classical mechanics introduced by Isaac Newton changed our understanding of motion and gravitation.
- **Theory of Evolution**: Proposed by Charles Darwin, it revolutionized biology by providing a scientific explanation for the diversity of life.

## 3. Prominent Scientists and Their Contributions
- **Galileo Galilei**: Advocated for observational astronomy and the scientific method.
- **Isaac Newton**: Formulated laws of motion and universal gravitation.
- **Charles Darwin**: Introduced natural selection as a mechanism for evolution.

## 4. Influential Changes Due to Discoveries and Technological Advancements
- The transition from classical to modern physics (e.g., Einstein's theory of relativity).
- Advancements in chemistry leading to the development of the periodic table.
- The impact of medical discoveries such as vaccinations and antibiotics.

## 5. Summary of Evolution
The progression of scientific knowledge is marked by pivotal shifts influenced by new theories, technological innovations, and the contributions of notable figures. Over time, science has evolved from a reliance on philosophical reasoning to a discipline grounded in empirical evidence, shaping humanity’s understanding of the universe.
