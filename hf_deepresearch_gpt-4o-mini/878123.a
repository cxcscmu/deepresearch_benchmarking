### Report on National and Local Policies Protecting People from Abuse

1. **National Policies**:
   - The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is a key federal law in the USA that addresses domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. It provides funding for victim services and enhances legal remedies. VAWA has seen several reauthorizations since its inception in 1994, broadening its protections for various groups of victims.
   - Internationally, countries like Canada and Australia have implemented comprehensive strategies akin to VAWA, focusing on community-based solutions and legal protections. 

2. **Local Policies**:
   - Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve specific information on local laws and regulations targeting abuse prevention or the support systems available to victims due to technical limitations in conducting searches. Normally, this would include an overview of jurisdiction-specific laws and a list of support organizations.

3. **Effectiveness of Policies**:
   - I encountered significant challenges obtaining recent studies or reports that evaluate the effectiveness of abuse prevention policies in 2023. Recommendations for future exploration involve using academic databases and government or NGO reports to gather insights on policy impacts.

### Conclusion
In summary, while national policies like VAWA exist, comprehensive local policy information remains elusive, and detailed evaluation studies of policy effectiveness have not been accessible. Recommendations include pursuing alternative databases and resources for further exploration of these topics.
