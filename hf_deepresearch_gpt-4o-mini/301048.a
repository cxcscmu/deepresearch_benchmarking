### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The definitions of violent crime differ slightly between the FBI and WHO. The FBI defines violent crime as primarily consisting of four specific offenses, while WHO covers a broader definition that encompasses various forms of violence.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, violent crime is classified into four main offenses:
1. **Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter**
2. **Forcible rape**
3. **Robbery**
4. **Aggravated assault** 
This classification is utilized in the FBI's statistical reporting and aggregates data regarding violent offenses nationwide.

On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides a broader definition of violence itself, describing it as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community." This definition highlights not just interpersonal violence but also includes potential psychological harm, maldevelopment, and deprivation resulting from violent actions. The WHO focuses on the consequences of violence and its public health implications.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding these definitions is crucial for developing effective strategies for crime prevention and public health initiatives. The FBI's statistical classification can help in law enforcement and policy-making, while WHO's broader perspective emphasizes the psychological and societal impacts of violence, underscoring the need for comprehensive approaches to prevent violence in various contexts.
