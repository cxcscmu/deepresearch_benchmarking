### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Research indicates beauty pageants negatively impact mental health, especially body image, self-esteem, and can lead to eating disorders among participants.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Numerous studies have shown that participation in beauty pageants can have detrimental effects on mental health. For instance, research conducted by Wonderlich et al. (2005) assessed the long-term impacts on women who participated in childhood beauty pageants. It was found that these women scored higher in body dissatisfaction and displayed signs of impulse dysregulation when compared to non-participants. Additionally, a more recent study reported that beauty pageant news coverage exacerbates body image issues among young women.

Furthermore, contestants often face societal pressures associated with 'thin-ideal' body imagery, which correlates with lower self-esteem and body image dissatisfaction (Churchill, 2023). Interestingly, there are contrasting perspectives as some participants have reported positively on their self-confidence and social skills developed through pageant involvement. Teen contestants of the Miss Utahâ€™s Outstanding Teen competition reflected on how participation aided their mental health, a sentiment that contrasts with common findings highlighting negative outcomes.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
A comprehensive evaluation of beauty pageants reveals a complex relationship with mental health. While negative outcomes predominate much of the literature, ongoing societal and cultural discussions may point to potential reforms in the beauty pageant systems that could alleviate mental health risks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance the potential benefits against the observed risks, suggesting a need for a nuanced approach to organizing these events.
