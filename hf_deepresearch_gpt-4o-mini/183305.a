### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of music on mood and behavior is profound, enhancing emotional well-being, promoting cognitive functions, and fostering social connections. Scientific studies indicate that music can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhance mood through neurotransmitter release, and encourage neuroplasticity in the brain.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Numerous studies collectively illustrate the significant effects of music on mood and behavior:

- **Emotional States**: Research shows that musical experiences can significantly increase positive affects and decrease negative emotions. For instance, university students who engaged with music therapy reported improvements in their emotional states through both listening and performing various music types.

- **Psychological Functions**: The psychological functions of music listening are multifaceted, including self-awareness, mood regulation, and social relatedness. People often use music as a tool for introspection, emotional expression, and enhancing group identity, with personal well-being being a primary motivation.

- **Song Selection and Depression**: Studies have highlighted how individuals, particularly those with tendencies toward depression, utilize music for mood regulation. However, self-awareness regarding the impact of their music choices on emotional health greatly varies.

- **Long-Term Effects**: The long-term effects of music include benefits such as reduced anxiety, improved cognition, enhanced memory, and social connectivity. Active engagement with music induces neuroplasticity, facilitating positive changes in mood and behavior across various demographics.

- **Active Music-Making**: Participation in active music-making significantly boosts mood via the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, promoting feelings of pleasure and emotional stability. Group musical activities further enhance social bonds and emotional health, serving as effective interventions in therapeutic settings.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The synthesis of these findings indicates that music is more than just an art form; it is a potent mechanism for enhancing mental health and fostering social connections. Its applications in therapy and education underline the importance of incorporating music into programs aimed at improving emotional well-being and mental health outcomes.
