### 1. Task outcome (short version):
I faced technical difficulties while attempting to gather reliable sources about the changes in the American West after the Reconstruction period, specifically from 1878 to 1900.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Despite multiple attempts, I encountered repeated errors indicating that there are not enough credits to perform searches to collect information about economic developments, social changes, demographic shifts, and legislative impacts in the American West during the specified years. This greatly limits my ability to fulfill the task effectively.
However, based on general historical knowledge, the American West saw significant changes after Reconstruction, including:

- **Economic Developments:** The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 facilitated the movement of goods and people, contributing to the West's economic growth. The cattle ranching and mining booms attracted many settlers and investors, leading to economic expansion. The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged westward migration by granting land to settlers, furthering agricultural development.

- **Demographic Shifts:** The period after Reconstruction witnessed a population increase due to migration from the East Coast and Europe. This influx of settlers often resulted in conflicts with Native American tribes as settlers encroached on their territories.

- **Social Changes:** The imposition of policies aimed at assimilating Native Americans into American society, such as the Dawes Act of 1887, marked a significant shift in government policy towards Indigenous populations. These policies often led to the loss of tribal land and culture.

- **Legislative Impacts:** Various federal acts and legislation, including the Pacific Railway Acts and the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, influenced land distribution and development strategies in the West.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
I recommend exploring reliable history websites, academic journals, or library resources that focus on American history during the late 19th century for more detailed information on this topic.
