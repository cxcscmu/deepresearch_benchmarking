### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Indians played significant and diverse roles in the wars for empire, serving in leadership, combat, and logistical positions across various conflicts, driven by both loyalty and resistance against colonial powers. Their involvement spanned from the Anglo-Mysore and Anglo-Sikh Wars, through the Sepoy Mutiny, and into both World Wars, shaping both military and social histories.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
#### **Anglo-Mysore Wars (1767-1799)**
- **Roles of Indians**: Led by Hyder Ali and later his son Tipu Sultan, Indian armies engaged the British East India Company in a series of conflicts to defend territories in South India. Although many Indians served in local armies, the British also recruited Indian sepoys into their forces.
- **Impact**: These wars marked significant resistance against British colonization and showcased the military capabilities of Indian rulers.

#### **Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845-1849)**
- **Roles of Indians**: The Sikh Empire fought against British forces in two major wars. Many Sikh soldiers stood against British forces, while others joined them in combat. The British faced intense resistance from local Sikh leaders and their followers.
- **Impact**: The wars ultimately led to the annexation of Punjab and the solidification of British control in Northern India, influencing Sikh identity and nationalism.

#### **Sepoy Mutiny (Indian Rebellion of 1857)**
- **Roles of Indians**: Indian sepoys revolted against the British East India Company, protesting cultural insensitivity, such as the use of animal fat in cartridges. The mutiny saw participation from diverse groups, including local leaders and the common populace.
- **Impact**: Although the rebellion was ultimately suppressed, it marked a pivotal point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of direct British rule in India and sowing the seeds of Indian nationalism.

#### **World War I (1914-1918)**
- **Roles of Indians**: Over 1.4 million Indian soldiers and non-combatants served in various theaters of war, including Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. They fought in important campaigns, such as in Flanders, at Gallipoli, and in Mesopotamia.
- **Impact**: The war effort highlighted the contributions of Indians to the British Empire, but it also raised questions about democracy and Indian self-governance, leading to increased political awakening among the Indian population.

#### **World War II (1939-1945)**
- **Roles of Indians**: Approximately 2.5 million Indians enlisted in the British Indian Army. Indian units were involved in significant battles across North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The war effort was crucial for the Allies, leading to the involvement of various Indian regiments.
- **Impact**: This massive mobilization was met with increasing opposition to British rule, culminating in the Quit India Movement in 1942. The sacrifices made during the war played a critical role in the push for Indian independence.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The wars significantly impacted Indian society, economy, and politics, changing how Indians viewed colonial rulers and igniting a spirit of nationalism that influenced the independence movement. The legacy of these conflicts continues to shape India's military and political narratives today.
