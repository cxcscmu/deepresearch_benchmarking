### Report on Why People Immigrate Illegally

#### 1. Economic Factors
- Many individuals seek better job opportunities and higher wages than what is available in their home countries. This is particularly evident for immigrants from countries experiencing economic hardship, such as Mexico and Central American nations.

#### 2. Violence and Insecurity
- A significant number of people flee from violence, gang threats, and insecurity in their home countries. For example, many migrants from the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras) leave due to escalating violence and a lack of safety.

#### 3. Poverty and Lack of Opportunities
- Chronic poverty and limited social mobility push individuals to migrate. Faced with a lack of access to education and job prospects, many see immigration as their best chance to improve their quality of life.

#### 4. Family Reunification
- Many unauthorized immigrants have family members living legally in the U.S. The drive to reunite with loved ones can motivate individuals to seek illegal entry when legal channels are insufficient.

#### 5. Smuggling Networks
- Established smuggling networks facilitate illegal crossings. These groups often exploit the vulnerabilities of potential migrants, creating pathways for unauthorized immigration.

#### 6. Mixed Migration Flows
- Recent trends show that migration involves both economic migrants and those seeking asylum due to humanitarian crises, complicating the nature of illegal immigration.

#### 7. Policy and Regulatory Factors
- When legal immigration pathways are limited or strict, individuals may resort to illegal means. Ineffective or overly complicated immigration policies can unintentionally encourage unauthorized immigration.

#### 8. Status of Unauthorized Immigrants
- As of 2023, approximately 11.7 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the U.S., many of whom contribute to sectors like agriculture and construction. Their presence reflects the complexity of labor market demands alongside the need for humane immigration policies.

### Conclusion
Understanding the motivations behind illegal immigration involves a complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors. Effective policy-making must address not only immediate security needs but also the underlying causes that compel individuals to pursue unauthorized paths to enter the country.

This report encapsulates the multifaceted reasons behind illegal immigration and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to immigration reform.
