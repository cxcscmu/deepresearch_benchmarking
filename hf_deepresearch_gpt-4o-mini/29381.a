### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Common arguments against abortion often stem from religious beliefs, moral considerations regarding the sanctity of life, and concerns about the ethical implications of terminating a pregnancy. Different demographics, such as age, religious affiliation, and political beliefs, influence these arguments significantly.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
**Religious Perspectives:**
- **Christianity:** Many Christian denominations argue that life begins at conception, making abortion equivalent to murder. This view is prevalent among evangelical Christians and the Catholic Church.
- **Islam:** In Islam, views on abortion can vary, but many scholars argue that the fetus has a right to life that must be respected, particularly after a certain point in gestation.

**Ethical and Moral Considerations:**
- **Sanctity of Life:** A common argument is centered around the belief that all human life is sacred and must be protected, regardless of circumstances.
- **Potentiality:** Opponents often argue that every fetus has the potential to become a life, and terminating that potential undermines societal values.

**Womenâ€™s Rights Perspective:**
- **Balancing Rights:** Some argue that while women have rights over their bodies, these rights may not extend to ending a potential life, raising complex ethical dilemmas.

**Cultural and Societal Values:**
- In many cultures, particularly those with traditional values, abortion is viewed negatively, often tied to social stigma and perceived irresponsibility.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the common arguments against abortion requires examining both the specific demographic makeup (age, race, education) and the underlying belief systems (religious, moral, philosophical) that inform these perspectives. Political affiliations also play a significant role, with conservatives often opposing abortion more vocally than liberals. Comprehensive studies and surveys can provide better insights into how these demographic factors interact with heartfelt beliefs around this contentious issue.
