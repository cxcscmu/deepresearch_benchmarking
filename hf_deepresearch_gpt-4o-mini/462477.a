### Successes of the Reconstruction Era:
1. **Legislative Achievements**: 
   - **13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments**: Abolished slavery, granted citizenship, and ensured voting rights for African Americans.
   - **Freedmen's Bureau**: Established to aid freed slaves and poor whites, providing them with education, housing, and healthcare.
   - **Reconstruction Acts**: Required Southern states to draft new constitutions that guaranteed African American suffrage.

2. **Political Gains**:
   - Increased number of African Americans in political office at local, state, and federal levels.
   - Establishment of Republican-led governments in Southern states.

3. **Social Integration**:
   - Efforts toward integrating formerly enslaved individuals into society, leading to new opportunities in education and employment.

### Failures of the Reconstruction Era:
1. **Violence and Resistance**:
   - White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan violently opposed Reconstruction efforts, leading to widespread intimidation and violence against African Americans.
   - Southern Democrats worked to undermine the Reconstruction governments.

2. **Economic Challenges**:
   - The South remained economically devastated after the Civil War, struggled with poverty, and faced challenges in rebuilding its economy.

3. **Legislative Setbacks**:
   - The withdrawal of federal troops by the late 1870s led to the end of effective Reconstruction efforts, paving the way for the implementation of Jim Crow laws.

### Conclusion:
The Reconstruction era was a complex period marked by significant achievements in the quest for civil rights and integration of former slaves. However, it faced severe opposition and failure to secure lasting changes, leading to a legacy of racial discrimination and segregation that continued to affect American society well into the 20th century.
