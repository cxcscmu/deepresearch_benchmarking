### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Informal project management encompasses various methods and frameworks that are less structured than formal project management methodologies. Some commonly recognized methods include Agile practices, collaborative tools, and adaptive approaches, while frameworks may include Lean and Scrum when applied informally.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Informal project management refers to strategies employed to manage projects without following strict organizational or methodological guidelines. This method is often adopted in smaller teams or projects where flexibility and speed are prioritized over rigid structures. Here are some prominent methods and frameworks:

- **Agile Practices**: Agile is widely recognized in project management for its emphasis on iterative progress and responsiveness to changes. In an informal setting, Agile can manifest as simple daily stand-ups or regular team check-ins without strict adherence to formal processes. 

- **Scrum Framework (Informal Use)**: While Scrum is a formal framework, teams can adopt its principles informally. This could involve setting short sprints and regularly reviewing progress without strictly following all Scrum ceremonies.

- **Lean Project Management**: This methodology focuses on maximizing value by minimizing waste. Informally, teams might adopt Lean principles during brainstorming sessions, emphasizing quick decision-making and experimentation without extensive documentation.

- **Collaborative Tools**: Tools like Trello or Asana can be utilized informally to manage tasks and collaborate without strict hierarchies or protocols. This approach fosters team communication and task tracking organically.

- **Ad-hoc Methods**: Many informal project management practices rely on the unique dynamics of the team. These may include brainstorming sessions, spontaneous discussions, and a strong focus on team empowerment.

In summary, informal project management methods prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to project needs, often using parts of established frameworks but adapting them to fit the less structured environment of informal settings.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Informal methods can vary significantly based on team dynamics, project types, and organizational cultures. It's also essential to understand the context in which these methods are applied, as informal project management can vary in effectiveness based on these factors.
