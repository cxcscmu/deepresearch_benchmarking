### Why Do Refugees Flee?

#### 1. Current Statistics on Global Refugee Populations
At the end of 2023, the global refugee population reached approximately **43.4 million**, showing a **7%** increase from the previous year. Major sources of refugees include:
- **Afghanistan**: 6.4 million
- **Syria**: 6.4 million

- **Ukraine**: 6.0 million

Most refugees (69%) are hosted in neighboring countries, with **75%** living in low- and middle-income nations.

#### 2. Common Causes of Forced Migration
The reasons why individuals flee and seek refuge in other countries include:

1. **Drought:** Extended periods of inadequate rainfall lead to food shortages, forcing communities to seek better living conditions.
2. **Conflict and Violence:** Armed conflicts and civil wars create life-threatening conditions that compel people to flee for safety.
3. **Natural Disasters:** Sudden events like earthquakes and hurricanes can destroy homes and infrastructure, leading to immediate displacement.
4. **Political Instability:** Oppressive political situations, including persecution and torture, drive people to seek refuge elsewhere.
5. **Economic Collapse:** Economic crises result in poverty and lack of services, pushing individuals to migrate for better opportunities.
6. **Climate Change:** Long-term climate changes threaten livelihoods, particularly harming agriculturally dependent communities, causing displacement.

According to recent reports, one person is uprooted every two seconds due to these causes, totaling over **68.5 million** displaced individuals globally.

#### 3. Summary
Understanding the complex interplay of these issues is vital for framing effective interventions to support displaced individuals and communities striving for safety and stability.
