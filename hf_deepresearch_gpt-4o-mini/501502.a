### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted students' mental health, with increased rates of depression and psychological distress observed across various demographics.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Various studies indicate a substantial deterioration in students' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic:
- University students reported elevated rates of depression, with some studies showing symptoms as high as 40%. 
- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) prevalence has increased, with over 50% of surveyed students experiencing clinically significant distress.
- A recent study highlighted an 8.5% increase in depression cases among young people during the pandemic and an overall increase in social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties.
- Psychological distress levels among university students surged, affecting their overall well-being, which was corroborated by a survey of nearly 96,489 students during the pandemic. Factors contributing to distress included loneliness and COVID-related stressors.
- Female students, particularly those from minority groups, were found to be significantly more affected by mental health issues compared to their male peers.
- Many students who suffered from mental health concerns did not utilize available mental health services, indicating barriers in access and support.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The findings across various studies underscore the need for educational institutions and policymakers to address mental health concerns, especially among already vulnerable demographics. The current data suggests a pressing need to develop targeted mental health supports and services that can effectively cater to the needs of students, particularly in response to the unique stressors introduced during the pandemic.
