### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Unable to retrieve the 2023 political corruption index for the United States due to tool limitations.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Repeated attempts to gather the 2023 political corruption index from credible sources have failed due to a lack of access to necessary search tools. Attempts to search for the index using various queries related to political corruption or transparency in the United States yielded no results. The expected output would have included the United States' ranking in the index, relevant statistics, and observations provided by organizations such as Transparency International.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
It may be beneficial to check the Transparency International website or other credible sources directly for the latest information. Additionally, if possible, reaching out to organizations or utilizing academic databases might provide alternative access to the required data.
