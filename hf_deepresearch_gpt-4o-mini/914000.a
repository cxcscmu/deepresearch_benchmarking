### Report: Should Schools Focus on Teen Health?

#### Introduction
Teen health is a critical area of concern that significantly affects not only the well-being of adolescents but also their academic performance and future health outcomes. With increasing rates of physical inactivity, unhealthy eating habits, and substance use among high school students, schools play a pivotal role in promoting health and healthy behaviors.

#### Current Statistics
The CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) provides pivotal statistics indicating that:
- A substantial number of teens engage in little to no physical activity and adopt unhealthy eating patterns. 
- Substance use remains a significant issue, indicating a pressing need for effective interventions targeting this demographic.

#### Impact of School Health Programs
Evidence suggests that schools focusing on health can lead to measurable improvements in student behaviors:
1. Health programs can promote physical activity and nutrition through structured physical education and healthy meal options.
2. Preventive education initiatives focusing on substance use not only raise awareness but also equip students with refusal skills and coping strategies to resist peer pressure.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, schools should indeed focus on teen health as the evidence from the CDC substantiates that poor health behaviors are prevalent among teenagers, and schools are a vital setting for interventions. Schools that implement health-focused programs can foster healthier lifestyles, potentially leading to better academic performance and lifelong health benefits.

Recommendations based on collected data must guide policy-making and program implementation within educational institutions.
