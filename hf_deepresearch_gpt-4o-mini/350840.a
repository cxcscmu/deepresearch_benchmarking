### Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices

#### 1. Introduction
Ethical individuals often find themselves in situations that challenge their moral beliefs, leading to decisions that may contradict their values. Understanding the dynamics behind such choices involves exploring psychological theories, real-life case studies, and the impact of situational factors.

#### 2. Psychological Concepts
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: This occurs when there is a conflict between a person's ethical beliefs and their actions. To alleviate discomfort, individuals may justify their unethical behavior by rationalizing it within a specific context.

- **Moral Disengagement**: Some individuals detach from their moral principles, allowing them to commit acts they would usually consider wrong. This detachment is often facilitated by convincing themselves that their actions do not cause harm or are justified by the situation.

- **Situational Influences**: External pressures, such as workplace culture or authority dynamics, can significantly impact ethical decision-making. When individuals are pressured to conform or achieve certain results, they may compromise their ethics.

#### 3. Case Studies
1. **Richard Nixon**: The 37th President engaged in unethical cover-up activities during the Watergate scandal, demonstrating how the pressure to protect his position led to decisions that contradicted expected ethical standards.

2. **Bill Clinton**: The former president faced impeachment due to an affair with Monica Lewinsky, reflecting a divergence between his personal ethics and responsibilities as a leader.

3. **Tiger Woods**: Renowned for his sportsmanship, Woods faced scandal involving extramarital affairs, highlighting the conflict between public persona and personal choices.

#### 4. Recommendations
To mitigate the risk of ethical breaches among ethical individuals, organizations should:
- Foster open communication around ethical dilemmas.
- Promote training programs that emphasize ethical decision-making.
- Establish a workplace culture that encourages transparency and accountability.

#### 5. Conclusion
The complexities surrounding ethical decision-making illustrate that individuals may deviate from their moral beliefs due to various pressures and motivations. Understanding this phenomenon can help organizations create environments that support ethical behavior and minimize conflicts.
