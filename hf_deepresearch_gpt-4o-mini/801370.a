### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Hitler's economic policies focused on public works, rearmament, and labor initiatives, significantly reducing unemployment and preparing Germany for war, but led to severe social and ethical ramifications. The long-term impact of these policies post-WWII led to significant challenges in economic recovery, shaped by the war's aftermath and subsequent reconstruction efforts, including the influence of the Marshall Plan. Comparatively, Germany's recovery trajectory was distinct due to its division into East and West, resulting in varying economic outcomes across different regions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
During Hitlerâ€™s regime (1933-1945), the German economy underwent major transformations due to several key policies:
- **Public Works Projects**: The construction of the Autobahn created jobs and aimed to prepare for military mobilization.
- **Rearmament**: Initiated in 1935, this program created employment opportunities but also set the stage for war.
- **Labor Policies**: Programs like 'Strength Through Joy' incentivized productivity but diminished traditional labor rights.

The economic turnaround saw unemployment drop from over 6 million in 1933 to less than 1 million by 1939. However, these gains were mitigated by the moral implications of militarization and oppression.

Post-WWII, the destruction led to:
- **Destruction and Dislocation**: Germany faced extensive rebuilding of infrastructure, industry, and housing.
- **Economic Division**: After the war, the division into East and West Germany resulted in differing economic models; West Germany adopted a social market economy with aid, while East Germany followed a command economy.
- **Marshall Plan Influence**: The U.S.-led Marshall Plan aided rapid recovery in West Germany, contributing to the economic miracle of the 1950s.
- **Comparative Development**: West Germany outperformed due to more aid, while East Germany stagnated under communist policies.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The contrasts between East and West Germany provide insight into the political and economic ideologies that shaped post-war development. Comparisons with other European nations reveal the critical roles of external aid and governance in determining recovery trajectories.
