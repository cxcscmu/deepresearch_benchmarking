### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Climate change affects sea levels primarily through thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. These processes result in a rise in global sea levels, posing risks to coastal communities and ecosystems.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Climate change impacts sea levels through two key mechanisms:
1. **Thermal Expansion**: As global temperatures rise, seawater warms and expands. Data from climate models indicate that the ocean's temperature has increased, leading to an increase in average sea level of about 1.2 inches (3.1 cm) over the last century due to thermal expansion alone.

2. **Ice Melt**: The melting of ice from glaciers and polar ice sheets contributes significantly to rising sea levels. The Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet are major contributors, with the loss of ice from these regions resulting in an increase in global sea levels. For instance, between 1993 and 2018, ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica contributed approximately 2.4 inches (6.1 cm) to sea level rise.

In total, sea levels have risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) since 1880, largely due to these two factors. Projections suggest that by the year 2100, sea levels could rise by another 1 to 8 feet (0.3 to 2.4 meters) if high greenhouse gas emissions continue, with potentially catastrophic impacts on coastal areas, ecosystems, and human settlements.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Rising sea levels threaten to inundate low-lying areas, increase flooding risks, and erode coastlines. Coastal communities face economic challenges as infrastructure is damaged or lost, and ecosystems such as wetlands and estuaries, which provide critical habitats for wildlife, are at risk.
