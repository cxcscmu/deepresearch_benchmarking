### Key Activities Contributing to Climate Change
- **Energy Sector**: 73% of emissions, with electricity and heat production accounting for 42%.
- **Industry**: 21% of emissions primarily from manufacturing and construction.
- **Agriculture**: 18% of emissions, majorly due to methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilizers.
- **Transportation**: 16% of emissions across various modes including road, aviation, and shipping.
- **Waste Management**: 3% from solid waste disposal and wastewater treatment.

### Impacts of Human Activities on Climate Change
- Rising global temperatures: Increased by approximately 1.1Â°C since the late 19th century.
- More frequent and severe weather events: Heatwaves, droughts, and flooding linked to higher greenhouse gas emissions.
- Urgent need for immediate action to transition to renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and adopt sustainable practices.

### Historical Context
- The 2023 findings indicate a 10% increase in emissions since the last assessment, showcasing a concerning trend in greenhouse gas emissions growth.

### Conclusions and Call for Action
- The IPCC emphasizes that significant and immediate reductions in emissions are necessary to meet global climate goals.
- The report serves as a clear call to action for policymakers to implement effective measures to combat climate change.
