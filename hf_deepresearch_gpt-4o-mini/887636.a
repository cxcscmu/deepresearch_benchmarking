Buddhism, founded in the 6th century BCE, has spread across Asia, adapting its teachings and practices to different cultures. 
Christianity, emerging from Judaism, has gone through significant transformations, especially during the Reformation which reshaped its practices and denominational structures. 
Islam, established in the 7th century, quickly expanded and has continued to evolve with various cultural and political influences, particularly evident in the establishment of diverse sects and schools of thought. 
Hinduism, rooted deeply in ancient traditions, presents a vast array of beliefs that have continuously branched out into various sects over thousands of years.

In contemporary society, the rise of secularism and interfaith dialogues illustrates a trend toward pluralism, while demographic shifts indicate changes in adherence to traditional religious practices.
