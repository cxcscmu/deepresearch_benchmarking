### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The American Civil War (1861-1865) was primarily caused by tensions surrounding slavery, state rights, and economic differences between the North and South. The conflict resulted in the preservation of the Union, the abolition of slavery, a high death toll, and significant social and political changes during the Reconstruction era.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The American Civil War was chiefly fueled by a myriad of intertwined causes:

- **Slavery**: This was the most prominent issue dividing the North and South. While the Northern states increasingly adopted abolitionist sentiments, the Southern economy relied on plantation agriculture, which depended heavily on enslaved labor. Efforts like the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850 aimed to maintain peace but failed to settle tensions, ultimately exacerbating divisions.

- **States’ Rights**: Southern states believed they had the right to govern themselves and make decisions regarding the legality of slavery without federal interference. This belief intensified during the 1850s and culminated in the secession of Southern states after Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860. They viewed his anti-slavery stance as a direct threat to their way of life.

- **Economic Differences**: The North was industrialized and favored tariffs, while the South was agrarian and relied on exports. The economic and political systems of both regions clashed, which further fueled conflict.

- **Secession**: After Lincoln's election, eleven Southern states seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America, and appointed Jefferson Davis as president. This act was seen as treasonous by the Union, which aimed to preserve its unity.

The war began in earnest when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Major battles ensued, leading to significant casualties on both sides.

**Consequences of the Civil War**:

- **Preservation of the Union**: The North’s victory ensured the United States remained a single, cohesive entity.

- **Abolition of Slavery**: The most monumental change was the end of slavery in the United States, formalized by the Thirteenth Amendment ratified in 1865.

- **Human Cost**: The war was the deadliest in American history, with approximately 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dying as a result of combat, disease, and poor medical care. This represented about 2% of the population at the time.

- **Economic Impact**: The war devastated the Southern economy, leading to the complete destruction of infrastructure and a long recovery period. Meanwhile, the Northern economy grew significantly due to wartime production.

- **Reconstruction Era**: Following the war, the United States entered a Reconstruction phase (1865-1877), aimed at rebuilding the South and integrating formerly enslaved people into society. This period faced significant challenges, including political strife, racial violence, and resistance to change.

- **Long-term Effects**: The Civil War and its aftermath established federal supremacy over states’ rights, setting a precedent that would affect American governance for generations. The legacies of this conflict, especially concerning race relations, would continue to shape American society.
