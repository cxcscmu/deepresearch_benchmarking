### Herbert Hoover's Response to the Bonus Army

#### 1. Background of the Bonus Army
The Bonus Army, formally known as the Bonus Expeditionary Force (BEF), was composed of approximately 43,000 marchers, primarily World War I veterans, along with their families and supporters. They marched to Washington, D.C. in the spring and summer of 1932, during the height of the Great Depression. Their primary demand was for the immediate payment of bonuses that had been promised to them under the Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924, which stipulated payment would not come until 1945.

#### 2. Hoover's Initial Response
President Herbert Hoover was initially reluctant to use force against the Bonus Army, attempting diplomatic negotiations instead. However, as their presence persisted and tension escalated, Hoover ultimately decided to take drastic measures.

#### 3. Use of Military Force
In July 1932, Hoover ordered the U.S. Army, led by General Douglas MacArthur, to remove the encampment. The military employed tear gas, cavalry, and tanks to disperse the marchers. This violent clash saw the burning of the Bonus Armyâ€™s makeshift camps and left several veterans injured.

#### 4. Public Reaction
The violent government response received widespread condemnation from both the press and the public. Many viewed this action as a betrayal of the veterans who had served their country, severely damaging Hoover's reputation and leading to a decrease in his popularity.

#### 5. Consequences
The events surrounding the Bonus Army not only highlighted the government's failure to address the needs of veterans during a time of economic crisis but also contributed to Hoover's defeat in the 1932 presidential election to Franklin D. Roosevelt.

### Conclusion
The Bonus Army incident serves as a critical moment in American history, showcasing the clash between veterans seeking justice and a government that failed to respond adequately. Hoover's response exemplified a disconnect from the struggles faced by many Americans during the Great Depression.
