### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Human activities such as fossil fuel usage, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes significantly contribute to climate change through rising greenhouse gas emissions.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Fossil Fuels: Burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation releases large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is a major contributor to global warming.

Deforestation: Trees absorb CO2, so when they are cut down or burned, the carbon stored in them is released back into the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating climate change.

Agriculture: Agricultural practices release greenhouse gases, particularly methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilizers, contributing significantly to climate change. The way crops are produced and livestock is managed can either mitigate or exacerbate these emissions.

Industrial Processes: Many industrial processes emit greenhouse gases as a byproduct of production. This includes emissions from the manufacture of cement, chemicals, and metals, which can significantly influence climate change.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Due to limitations in resource access, specific quantitative data on the percentage contributions of each activity to overall greenhouse gas emissions could not be retrieved. It is suggested to refer to reputable sources such as IPCC reports or governmental environmental agencies for the most accurate and recent statistics.
