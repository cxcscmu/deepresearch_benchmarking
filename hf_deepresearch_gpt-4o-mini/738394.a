### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The origins of racial discrimination studies can be traced back to historical events such as colonialism, slavery, and civil rights movements which fundamentally shaped social attitudes and academic inquiry into racial issues.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The study of racial discrimination has deep historical roots, starting from ancient civilizations where social hierarchies were often defined by race and ethnicity. Scholars have examined how these constructs were formalized during significant periods, such as:
- **Colonialism:** European powers established racial hierarchies to justify the exploitation of colonized peoples.
- **Slavery:** The transatlantic slave trade created systemic racism that has persisted and evolved into modern racial discrimination.
- **Civil Rights Movements:** These movements challenged systemic discrimination and prompted academic inquiry into race relations, leading to formal disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, and history focusing on these dynamics. 
Over time, the discourse around racial discrimination has evolved, impacted by landmark events, increasing social awareness, and the emergence of theoretical frameworks that seek to explain and address racial inequalities.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Despite extensive studies on racial discrimination, access to contemporary academic and historical studies remains limited in my current resources. Key figures in this field include W.E.B. Du Bois, who has critically shaped the discourse around race, while institutions across the world engage in ongoing research to understand and dismantle racial discrimination.
