## Report on the Impact of the Gilded Age on Traditional Understandings of Freedom

### I. Definition and Timeline of the Gilded Age
The Gilded Age refers to a transformative era in American history that spans approximately from the 1870s to the early 1900s. It is characterized by unprecedented economic expansion, industrial growth, and significant social changes. The term indicates a superficial glitter hiding deeper underlying issues such as corruption and inequality.

### II. Key Social and Economic Changes During the Gilded Age
1. **Economic Growth:** The transition from agrarian to industrial economies marked the rise of major corporations and significant wealth disparities.
2. **Urbanization:** More individuals moved to cities than ever before, leading to new cultural identities and urban challenges.
3. **Immigration:** A massive influx of immigrants transformed the demographic landscape.
4. **Labor Movements:** Workers organized for better wages and conditions, exemplified by events like the Pullman Strike and the emergence of unions.

### III. Traditional Understandings of Freedom Before the Gilded Age
Freedom in America before the Gilded Age was influenced by Enlightenment thought, emphasizing personal liberty, natural rights, and equality. However, these ideals were often reserved for certain demographics, including landowners and property owners. Meanwhile, enslaved individuals and women fought against a restrictive understanding of freedom, asserting their rights.

### IV. Confronting Traditional Understandings of Freedom During the Gilded Age
The Gilded Age forced Americans to confront their traditional definitions of freedom through the lens of labor movements, rising inequality, and the social struggles of women and marginalized groups. The contradictions in the application of freedom highlighted a need for a broader re-examination of rights and protections for all citizens.

### Conclusion
The Gilded Age acted as a catalyst for redefining freedom in America, setting the stage for the progressive movements that would follow. It exposed the limitations of traditional freedom and encouraged a more inclusive understanding of civil rights.
