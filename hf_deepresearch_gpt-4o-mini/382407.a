Climate Change and Health Impact Report:

Respiratory Issues:
- Climate change exacerbates air pollution, leading to increased respiratory problems such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Higher temperatures can increase the concentration of ground-level ozone, which worsens air quality.

Vector-Borne Diseases:
- Changes in climate allow for the expansion of habitats for vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks, increasing the risk of diseases like malaria and Lyme disease.
- Climate change alters patterns of disease transmission, with regions previously unaffected by certain diseases now becoming vulnerable.

Heat-Related Illnesses:
- Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as the elderly.
- Increased temperatures can cause dehydration, exacerbating chronic conditions.

Mental Health Effects:
- Extreme weather events and natural disasters linked to climate change can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety.
- Displacement due to climate impacts can increase feelings of helplessness and stress related to loss of home and community.
