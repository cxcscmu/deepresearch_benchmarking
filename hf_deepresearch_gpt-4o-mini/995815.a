## Factors Influencing Police Discretion

2. **Situational Factors**: Specific circumstances during an incident that can affect an officer's decision, like the severity of a crime or suspect behavior.
3. **Social Factors**: Community relations and public opinion impacting how discretion is exercised.
4. **Organizational Factors**: Police department policies, training, and culture that dictate how much discretion is allowed.
5. **Personal Factors**: Individual officer characteristics such as experience, biases, and personal values that may influence discretion.

## Context

Positive outcomes involving police discretion may lead to community engagement, while negative outcomes may result in perceptions of bias.
