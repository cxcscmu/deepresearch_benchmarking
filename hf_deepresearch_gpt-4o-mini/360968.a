**Key Principles of Fair Trade:**  
According to the **World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO)**, the ten principles of fair trade are as follows:  
1. **Creating Opportunities for Marginalized Producers**: Fair trade prioritizes supporting producers who are disadvantaged or marginalized in the global market.

3. **Fair Trade Practices**: Organizations should engage in fair trading practices and maintain ethical partnerships with producers.  
4. **Payment of a Fair Price**: A price is agreed upon in advance, which allows producers to receive a fair wage that reflects the effort and resources required for their goods.  
5. **Anti-Discrimination, Gender Equality, and Freedom of Association**: Fair trade promotes employment policies that do not discriminate based on gender, race, or religion and ensures the right to organize.  
6. **Ensuring Good Working Conditions**: Fair trade organizations work to create safe working environments that respect labor standards and human rights.  
7. **Respect for the Environment**: The fair trade movement encourages sustainable practices that protect the environment and promote ecological stewardship.

### 3. Additional context:  
Fair trade goes beyond just helping producers earn a better income; itâ€™s about dismantling systemic inequalities in trade practices. This ethical approach plays a pivotal role in fostering sustainable development and improving lives in producer communities. Public awareness and consumer education about fair trade's principles are crucial for its effectiveness and growth.
