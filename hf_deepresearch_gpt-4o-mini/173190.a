### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The American Revolutionary War was primarily caused by colonial resistance to British taxation without representation, restrictive trade laws, and a desire for greater autonomy.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The causes of the American Revolutionary War can be attributed to several key factors that culminated in the colonial desire for independence:

1. **Taxation Without Representation**: One of the main grievances of the American colonists was the imposition of taxes by the British Parliament, in which they had no representatives. The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 imposed taxes on everyday items and legal documents, inciting widespread protest.

2. **The Boston Tea Party**: In response to the Tea Act of 1773, which granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, colonists protested by dumping large quantities of tea into Boston Harbor. This incident exacerbated tensions and led to punitive measures from Britain.

3. **Restrictive Trade Laws**: The British government implemented a series of laws that restricted colonial trade with other nations, leading to economic hardship and resentment. The Navigation Acts were particularly restrictive, as they dictated that certain goods could only be shipped to England or English colonies.

4. **Military Presence and the Quartering Act**: The presence of British troops in the colonies, especially after the French and Indian War, led to distrust and hostility. The Quartering Act required colonists to provide housing and supplies for British soldiers, which further inflamed tensions.

5. **The Intolerable Acts**: After the Boston Tea Party, the British government enacted the Intolerable Acts (1774) as a punishment for the rebellion. These acts included closing Boston Harbor and revoking Massachusetts' charter, which were seen as direct assaults on colonial autonomy.

6. **Influential Pamphlets and Literature**: Works like Thomas Paine's 'Common Sense' and the writings of other Enlightenment thinkers promoted the idea of independence and rallied public opinion against British rule.

7. **Growing Sense of American Identity**: Over time, the colonies developed a distinct identity separate from Britain, fueled by shared experiences and the burgeoning of ideas about liberty and governance.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The American Revolutionary War ultimately started in 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord and continued until 1783, resulting in the formation of the United States as an independent nation. Understanding these causes provides crucial insight into the motivations behind the revolution and the development of American democratic principles.
