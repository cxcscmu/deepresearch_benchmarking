### 1. Task outcome (short version):
In 2023, the distilled water market is experiencing significant shortages due to increased demand and disrupted supply chains. The global distilled water market was valued at approximately $87.73 million in 2023, with expectations for major growth.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
In 2023, the supply of distilled water has become critically low, driven by high demand across various sectors including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and healthcare. The increase in demand is primarily attributed to the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which production capacities were reduced due to factory shutdowns and labor shortages. As a result, many manufacturers are struggling to meet the heightened requirements for distilled water, leading to reports of stock shortages in retail outlets.

The current prices for distilled water reflect these shortages; for example, one gallon of distilled water can cost between $1.44 and $8.70, depending on the retailer. Mainstream retailers such as Walmart list distilled water, indicating price variations based on brand and seller.

Additionally, the reliance on distilled water spans multiple industries. In pharmaceuticals, for example, distilled water is crucial for preparing medications and sterilizing equipment. Electronics manufacturing also relies on distilled water to clean components without introducing impurities. The ongoing shortages have prompted price hikes and disrupted the operational stability of industries reliant on this essential resource.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Due to the intertwined challenges of increased consumer awareness regarding clean water needs and persistent supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic, the distilled water market is projected to see considerable growth in the coming years. The market is expected to reach approximately $123.15 million by 2031 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. Companies and consumers alike may need to explore alternative water sources or purification methods as the industry navigates these complexities.
