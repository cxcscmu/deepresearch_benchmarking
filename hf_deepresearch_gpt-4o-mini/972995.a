### Manchurian Crisis (1931-1933)
The Manchurian Crisis began with the Mukden Incident on September 18, 1931, which served as a pretext for Japanese troops to invade Manchuria. The League of Nations condemned Japan's actions and dispatched the Lytton Commission, which determined that Japan's invasion was an act of aggression. Despite this, Japan rejected the League's findings and withdrew from the League in 1933. This event significantly weakened the League's credibility and highlighted its lack of enforcement mechanisms.

### Abyssinia Crisis (1935-1936)
The Abyssinia Crisis started when Italy invaded Ethiopia in October 1935. The League condemned Italy's actions and attempted to impose economic sanctions. However, crucial resources like oil were excluded from these sanctions, rendering them ineffective. Italy successfully annexed Ethiopia in 1936. The failure to address this aggression diminished international confidence in the League and exemplified its inability to uphold collective security.

### Key Failures of the League of Nations
1. **Lack of Enforcement Capability**: The League relied on member nations' willingness to enforce its decisions. This lack of military power and inability to compel nations to comply with its resolutions led to critical failures in both crises.
2. **Absence of Major Power Participation**: The non-participation of significant powers like the United States and the expulsion of nations like Japan eroded the League's influence.
3. **Ineffective Sanctions**: The Leagueâ€™s sanctions were often ineffective due to exclusions of vital resources and a lack of commitment from member states to enforce them robustly.
4. **Erosion of Credibility**: Repeated failures in significant crises illustrated to aggressor nations that there were minimal repercussions for military aggression, undermining the League's authority and facilitating the path to World War II.
