### Structured Report: Reasons for the Prolonged Duration of the Cold War

1. **Geopolitical Tensions**: The Cold War, lasting from 1947 to 1991, was a period of intense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, primarily fueled by conflicting ideologiesâ€”capitalism and communism. The aftermath of World War II set the stage for this prolonged conflict.

2. **Key Events**:
   - **1947**: The Truman Doctrine pledged US support for countries resisting communism.
   - **1948**: The Berlin Blockade escalated tensions as the USSR blocked access to West Berlin, leading to the US's Berlin Airlift.
   - **1949**: Formation of NATO in response to Soviet threats reinforced military alliances.
   - **1955**: Establishment of the Warsaw Pact solidified opposing military alliances.
   - **1950-1953**: The Korean War exemplified military engagement influenced by Cold War dynamics.
   - **1961**: The construction of the Berlin Wall physically manifested the ideological divide.
   - **1962**: The Cuban Missile Crisis brought both superpowers to a nuclear brink, heightening tensions.
   - **1979**: Soviet invasion of Afghanistan sparked international backlash and resistance, further elongating Cold War animosity.
   - **1989**: The fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the decline of communist influence in Eastern Europe.

3. **Ideological Conflicts**: The fundamental ideological divide created persistent friction, with both nations exerting efforts to expand their political influence globally.

4. **Nuclear Arms Race**: The buildup of nuclear arsenals and the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) promoted an environment of distrust, discouraging direct military confrontations but ensuring the conflict remained active.

5. **Political Reforms and Changes**: The eventual leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s introduced significant reformations, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, marking the Cold War's conclusion.

In summary, the Cold War lasted as long as it did due to a complex interplay of ideological conflicts, geopolitical maneuvers, strategic miscalculations, and significant historical events that continually fueled tensions between the two superpowers.
