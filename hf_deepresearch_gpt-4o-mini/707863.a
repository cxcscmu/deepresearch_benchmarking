### Report on Public Goods as a Market Failure

**1. Definition and Characteristics of Public Goods:**
Public goods are defined as goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means:
- **Non-Excludability**: Individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using the good.
- **Non-Rivalry**: One person's use of the good does not diminish another person's ability to use it.

**2. Examples of Public Goods:**
- National Defense: Protects all citizens and is funded by government.
- Public Parks: Available for everyone's enjoyment without restriction.
- Clean Air: Accessibility is universal and does not diminish with use.

**3. Definition of Market Failure:**
Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, leading to a loss in social welfare. 

**4. How Public Goods Lead to Market Failure:**
- **Under-Provision**: Since public goods are free to access, individuals have little incentive to pay for them, leading to insufficient funding for their provision.
- **Free-Rider Problem**: Individuals benefit from resources that they do not pay for, resulting in under-resourced public goods.
- **Inefficient Allocation**: Without government intervention, public goods may not be provided at all, leading to inefficiencies.

**5. Conclusion:**
Understanding public goods as a source of market failure informs the need for government intervention to ensure these goods are adequately provided and funded, thereby enhancing societal welfare.
