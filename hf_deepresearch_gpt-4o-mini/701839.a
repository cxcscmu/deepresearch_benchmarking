Research is defined as a systematic inquiry into a subject to discover or revise facts, theories, or applications. It is fundamental in various aspects of daily life, including healthcare, education, technology, and policy-making.

For instance, in healthcare, research helps in developing new treatments and understanding diseases. Clinical trials determine the effectiveness of medications before they are available to the public.
