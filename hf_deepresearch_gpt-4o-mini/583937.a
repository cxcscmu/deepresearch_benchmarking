   Outsourcing is the business practice of delegating specific functions or processes to external agencies or organizations, often for the purposes of cost reduction and operational efficiency.

2. **Impacts of Outsourcing on Employees**:

   - The push for flexibility and remote work, accelerated by the pandemic, has allowed companies to engage global talent but caused local job displacements.
   - A focus on core competencies, with one-off specialties being outsourced, leading to job transformations within organizations.

4. **Management Strategies**:
