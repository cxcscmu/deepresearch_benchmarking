### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The UN faces challenges in maintaining global security due to limitations in peacekeeping, necessity for state consent for interventions, evolving international norms, and complexities of internal conflicts in states, particularly in the Third World.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The article outlines several key challenges that the United Nations encounters in its efforts to maintain global security:

1. **Operational Limitations**: The UN often operates under the principle of consent from the involved parties, which restricts its ability to enforce peace when tensions are high. This framework can hinder decisive action against aggressors or prevent timely interventions in crises.

2. **Resource Constraints**: The UN has inadequate resources and capabilities for robust peace enforcement or intervention, which limits its effectiveness in many conflict scenarios. Many member states are reluctant to commit troops or funding, impacting the UN's ability to take effective action.

3. **Evolving Norms**: The shift in international norms surrounding intervention and state sovereignty complicates the UN's role. Modern expectations of humanitarian interventions and responsibility to protect have grown, but the UN struggles to translate these norms into actionable policies accepted by member states.

4. **Complex Internal Conflicts**: Many contemporary conflicts arise from internal divisions within states, particularly in the Third World. The UN often finds itself caught between the desire for humanitarian intervention and the necessity of respecting state sovereignty, leading to a cautious approach that may not adequately address urgent crises.

5. **Political Will**: The effectiveness of the UN often depends on the political will of its member states, which can be inconsistent. Divergent national interests frequently impede collective action, leaving the UN to navigate a landscape where cooperation is challenging.

6. **Changing Nature of Threats**: The nature of global threats is evolving, with non-state actors, terrorism, and transnational crime creating new dynamics that traditional state-centered responses may not effectively handle.

By addressing these challenges, the UN can work towards enhancing its capacity to respond to conflicts and maintain global security, though achieving consensus among member states remains a fundamental hurdle.

### 3. Additional context:
The article from Ethics & International Affairs provides a scholarly examination of the United Nations' role in global security, focusing on historical and contemporary limitations it faces. Given the UN's foundational principles of sovereignty and consent, summarizing the complexities of its mission requires consideration of geopolitical dynamics, historical context, and the evolving international political landscape. The challenges faced by the UN in maintaining global security highlight the intricate interplay between national interests and collective global security efforts.
