# How New Police Officers Enter the Police Subculture

## 1. Introduction to Police Subculture
The police subculture refers to the values, norms, and routines that govern the behavior and practices of police officers. This subculture is often characterized by a strong sense of loyalty, camaraderie, and a distinct perspective on crime and law enforcement. As new officers join the force, they encounter a complex set of influences that shape their integration into this subculture.

## 2. The Process of Socialization
The socialization of new police officers typically begins with formal training during the police academy. This training usually covers legal principles, departmental policies, physical skills, and ethical behavior. However, it is the informal interactions with seasoned officers that significantly impact socialization, as new recruits learn to navigate the unwritten rules and expectations of the police culture.

### 2.1. The Role of the Academy
Training academies serve as the entry point where foundational knowledge is imparted. New officers learn about the operational structure of law enforcement and engage in simulated police scenarios, which lay the groundwork for their future roles.

### 2.2. Field Training
Upon graduation, new officers enter a Field Training Officer (FTO) program where they are paired with experienced officers. The FTO serves both as a mentor and a role model, providing guidance on practical aspects of policing that are often absent from academy training.

## 3. Key Influences on New Officers
Several key factors influence how new officers assimilate into the police subculture:

- **Peer Relationships**: The interactions with peers can reinforce cultural norms and values, creating a sense of belonging or alienation.
- **Mentorship**: Support from experienced officers can facilitate smoother transitions by providing guidance and wisdom on navigating the department's culture.
- **Organizational Culture**: The values upheld by the police department and leadership play a significant role in shaping subordinate officers' views and behaviors.
- **Community Interactions**: Engagement with the community also affects how officers perceive their roles and responsibilities.

## 4. Conclusion
Successfully entering the police subculture requires new officers to adapt to and internalize the complex values, beliefs, and practices inherent to law enforcement. This process is shaped by formal education, mentorship, peer interactions, and the organizational environment of the police department.

In light of the findings from literature, it is essential for departments to be aware of the influences that shape new officers and to actively promote a culture that supports positive socialization into the police force.
