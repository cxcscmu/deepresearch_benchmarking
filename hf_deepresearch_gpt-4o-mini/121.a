### How European “Ethnics” Became White

#### Historical Context of Racial Identity Classifications
The history of racial identity in Europe began with classifications based on ethnicity and religion, transitioning over time due to colonialism, the rise of nationalism, and socio-political movements. Early classifications were often informal and based on cultural divisions rather than scientific racial theories.

#### Key Racial Theories
- **Carl Linnaeus** classified humans into four groups based on skin color and behavior, attributing cultural traits, which laid a foundation for early racial classifications.
- **Johann Friedrich Blumenbach** proposed five races based on cranial measurements, asserting the superiority of the Caucasian race, which contributed to social hierarchies and racial prejudices that justified imperialism. 

#### Laws and Policies Affecting Racial Classifications
- **Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws** (1935) classified citizens racially, targeting Jews and racial minorities, which exemplifies extreme racial classifications.
- **British Empire**: Colonial policies reflected and reinforced racial hierarchies during colonization, prioritizing European identities.
- **Post-war Europe** saw significant legislative changes as nations grappled with immigration and human rights, leading to reforms in how racial classifications were viewed and enforced.

#### Significant Historical Events
1. Colonialism fundamentally altered perceptions of race, establishing a legacy of racial superiority among Europeans.
2. The Holocaust forced a critical reassessment of racial ideologies and promoted human rights discussions.
3. The civil rights movements of the late 20th century challenged existing racial policies throughout Europe, advocating for racial equality.
4. Recent rises in nationalism have ushered in renewed conversations about race, identity, and social policy, impacting contemporary views regarding ethnic classifications.

### Conclusion
The transformation of European "ethnics" into the category of "white" can be understood through a complex interplay of cultural, legal, and social changes. The work of racial theorists, alongside historical laws and significant events, collectively contributed to the establishment and evolution of racial identities throughout Europe. 

These historical narratives continue to influence modern discussions surrounding race and identity; thus, ongoing inquiry into these topics remains vital for understanding contemporary societal dynamics.
