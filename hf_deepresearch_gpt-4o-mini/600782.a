### 1. Task outcome (short version):
There is a recognized correlation between high intelligence and anxiety, but specific studies could not be accessed due to limitations in the tool's capabilities.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Numerous research studies in psychology suggest that individuals with high intelligence often experience heightened levels of anxiety. Previous research has pointed toward the idea that the cognitive processes involved in higher intelligence may include an increased capacity for worry and overthinking, which can result in anxiety. Additionally, some scholars identify that gifted individuals might struggle with social interactions and may become isolated, leading to feelings of anxiety. However, academic access to specific studies was not possible in this instance, limiting the ability to present detailed findings, statistics, and references.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
To gather comprehensive details on this topic, researchers often refer to psychological journals or databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or JSTOR for studies on the correlation between intelligence and anxiety. It may be beneficial to conduct searches in those databases directly or consult with academic librarians to obtain specific papers that examine this relationship in depth.
