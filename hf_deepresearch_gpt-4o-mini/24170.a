In 2023, there were three active shooter incidents in educational settings, resulting in 10 casualties (3 killed and 7 wounded). More than 236,000 students have been exposed to gun violence since the Columbine shooting in 1999. Alarmingly, in recent data, 7% of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon at school.

### 2. Legislation on Gun Control and School Safety
Notable legislative developments in 2023 include:
- **California's Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Act**: Mandates safe storage practices and funds school safety programs.
- **Texas**: Introduced laws to add armed guards and mental health training for school personnel. However, there are critiques about the feasibility of implementing these measures.

### 3. Effective Programs and Prevention Strategies
Key programs include:
- **Sandy Hook Promise**: Training for recognizing warning signs of potential violence.
- **Threat Assessment Programs**: Identification of students at risk of committing violence.
- **Everytown for Gun Safety**: Resources for creating comprehensive safety protocols encompassing mental health and conflict resolution.

### 4. Mental Health Initiatives
Mental health support is vital, with reports indicating 40% of students experience persistent sadness or hopelessness. Schools increasingly recognize the connection between mental well-being and safety.

### 5. Recommendations for Future Actions
- Schools should implement proactive mental health support and safety protocols.

- Engage community resources to ensure a holistic approach in preventing violence.

Continuous assessment and adjustment of these initiatives are crucial to ensure their effectiveness in fostering safer educational environments.
