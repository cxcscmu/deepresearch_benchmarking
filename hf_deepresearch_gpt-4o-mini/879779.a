### 1. Task outcome (short version):

Numerous peer-reviewed studies and WHO and CDC reports confirm that COVID-19 vaccines are largely safe, with some rare adverse events such as myocarditis associated specifically with certain vaccines. Ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure public safety.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):

1. **Peer-reviewed Studies:**  
- A **systematic review** found that all approved COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and are deemed safe and effective. Specifically, mRNA vaccines were found to be more efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 compared to others.  
- Another study evaluated over **99 million vaccinated individuals** and highlighted notable safety signals for events like myocarditis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with certain vaccines, confirming previously known safety signals and necessitating continued monitoring.

2. **WHO Reports:**  
- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** maintains that billions have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. The organization emphasizes that all approved vaccines are continuously monitored for safety, and serious reactions are extremely rare. They work in collaboration with national health authorities to ensure vaccine safety standards are met globally. 
- A recent WHO report dated *March 10, 2025*, reassured that the vaccines remain safe, with actionable monitoring frameworks in place.

3. **CDC Reports:**  
- According to the **CDC**, most side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are mild and self-limiting. Detailed safety information is provided, highlighting that adverse events, while possible, are rare compared to the overall benefits of vaccination. The latest CDC update as of *January 31, 2025*, continues to affirm safety monitoring strategies and acknowledges existing effects.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):  
- Vaccination safety is a priority for global health. With sustained vigilance from health organizations, ongoing research is essential to uphold the confidence of the public in vaccines, especially amidst evolving variants of the virus.
