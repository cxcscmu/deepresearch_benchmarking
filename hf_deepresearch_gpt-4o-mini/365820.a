### Structured Report on Steroid Use in Sports

#### 1. Legal Status
The use of steroids in sports is prohibited under the regulations of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Steroids are categorized as prohibited substances, and athletes caught using them face severe penalties, including disqualification from events, suspension, and ban from competition.

#### 2. Health Effects
Steroid use poses substantial health risks, including but not limited to:
- Liver damage
- Cardiovascular issues (heart attack, stroke)
- Hormonal imbalances
- Psychological effects (aggression, depression)
- Increased risk of dependence and addiction

#### 3. Ethical Arguments
**Arguments for Steroid Use:**
- **Enhanced Performance:** Can significantly improve athletic capabilities and records.
- **Leveling the Playing Field:** Could normalize competition if widespread use occurs.
- **Medical Needs:** Some athletes may have legitimate health conditions benefiting from steroid use.
- **Personal Autonomy:** Athletes should have the right to make decisions regarding their own bodies.

**Arguments against Steroid Use:**

#### 4. Prevalence of Steroid Use
Current prevalence statistics remain difficult to ascertain, with previous reports indicating that certain sports, especially bodybuilding and baseball, have higher rates of steroid use. Although specific recent data are lacking, past surveys suggested rates of use around 30% among certain athlete populations.

#### 5. Regulations Across Professional Leagues
Regulatory bodies like WADA impose stringent guidelines to mitigate steroid use in sports:
- **WADA Regulations:** Enforces global anti-doping policies and allows for strict testing procedures.
