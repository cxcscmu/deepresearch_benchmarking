### Report on the Political Power of Dispensationalists

1. **Definition of Dispensationalism**: Dispensationalism is a theological system predominantly within Christian eschatology, interpreting biblical history as divided into distinct periods known as 'dispensations' in which God interacts with humanity. Features include:
- Literal interpretation of Scripture and prophetic texts.
- The belief in a pre-tribulation rapture.
- Distinctions made between Israel and the Church.

2. **Historical Context**: Originating in the 19th century through figures like John Nelson Darby, the theology gained traction with the publication of the Scofield Reference Bible, which shaped the understanding of biblical prophecy particularly in American evangelicalism. Throughout the 20th century, it significantly influenced the Christian right and shaped political movements.

3. **Demographics**: While specific current statistics for 2023 are not accessible, historically, dispensationalism has maintained a strong following among evangelical Christians in America, influencing various age groups and demographics, notably among conservative white evangelicals.

4. **Key Political Figures**: Political power among dispensationalists is represented by various prominent figures:
- **Donald Trump**: His presidency saw significant evangelical support, especially for pro-Israel policies.
- **Mike Pence**: Known for his strong evangelical roots and alignment with dispensationalist views, influencing grassroots politics.
- **Marjorie Taylor Greene** and **Ted Cruz**: Both resonate with evangelical voters, promoting policies that align with dispensational beliefs.

5. **Political Influence and Strategies**: Dispensationalists have historically aligned with political movements, particularly in supporting Israel and conservative social issues like opposition to abortion. They are influential within the Republican Party and continue to mobilize politically to affect foreign and domestic agendas.

### Conclusion
Dispensationalists derive political power from a combination of theological beliefs that inform their political opinions, historical roots within American evangelicalism, influential political figures who advocate for dispensationalist views, and a strong grassroots organization that champions these beliefs in the political arena.
