### LinkedIn Learning Usage in Companies: Summary Report

#### 1. Best Practices
Unfortunately, attempts to gather best practices from companies using LinkedIn Learning were unsuccessful due to limitations in web search capabilities. No specific case studies or examples could be retrieved.

#### 2. Usage Statistics
Efforts to access updated statistics regarding LinkedIn Learning's corporate usage demographics and engagement metrics for 2023 were also hindered, leading to an inability to present quantitative insights into how companies implement and benefit from this platform.

#### 3. Effectiveness Analysis
Searching for recent articles or whitepapers analyzing the effectiveness of LinkedIn Learning returned no relevant results. Thus, the impact of the platform on corporate training outcomes cannot be discussed comprehensively.

#### 4. Next Steps
Given these constraints:
- Consider direct engagement with LinkedIn Learning's official resources or industry publications, which may provide insights.
- Explore user testimonials or potentially relevant academic databases that focus on e-learning effectiveness.

### Conclusion
The expected detailed report on how companies are using LinkedIn Learning could not be fully assembled due to the lack of available resources and technical limitations encountered during the search process.
