### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The impact of advertising on consumer behavior in 2023 indicates that advertising significantly influences consumer attitudes, preferences, and purchasing decisions. Studies reveal that tailored and creative advertising fosters stronger consumer engagement and trust.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Recent studies from 2023 highlight the substantial effects of advertising on consumer behavior:

- **Positive and Creative Advertising:** Research shows that creative and personalized advertisements have a notable positive impact on consumer buying intentions (Farhan & Ina, 2023). Consumers respond more favorably to advertisements that resonate with their preferences and values.

- **Medium Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of advertising varies across different media. For instance, television advertisements are potent for categories that require visual demonstration, while online and mobile advertisements have proven effective for their targeted reach (IJNRD, 2023).

- **Consumer Engagement:** Tailoring advertising content to meet consumer expectations leads to increased trust and loyalty, with consumers favoring brands that reflect their values and preferences (Philomath Research, 2023).

- **Digital Media Impact:** The rise of digital media has transformed advertising strategies, allowing for personalized and dynamic content delivery. Studies suggest that consumers exhibit positive attitudes toward advertisements they encounter online, particularly those that are relevant to their shopping habits.

- **Overall Findings:** The literature consistently indicates that well-executed advertising campaigns can enhance brand awareness and influence consumer purchasing decisions positively. The complex relationship between advertisements and consumer behavior emphasizes the need for strategic planning in marketing to engage effectively with consumers.

### 3. Additional context:
It's essential to consider that while advertising has generally positive effects, there also exists a potential for negative impacts, such as consumer skepticism towards overly aggressive marketing. Future studies should examine these aspects to provide a balanced view.
