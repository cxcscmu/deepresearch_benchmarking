### Legal and Political Effects of the Dred Scott Decision

#### Legal Implications:
1. The Dred Scott decision denied citizenship to all African Americans, establishing that they could be treated as property rather than having rights. This set a concerning legal precedent regarding racial inequality.
2. The ruling effectively invalidated the Missouri Compromise, clarifying that the federal government could not regulate slavery in the territories, leading to further legal disputes over slavery's expansion.

#### Political Implications:
1. The decision created intense sectional tensions between free and slave states, deepening divisions that contributed to the Civil War.
2. It galvanized abolitionist movements and increased anti-slavery sentiment in the North, leading to a heightened political response against slavery.
3. The ruling significantly influenced the development of the 14th Amendment, which aimed to guarantee citizenship and equal rights for all persons.

Overall, the Dred Scott decision had profound and far-reaching implications on both legal and political frameworks in the United States, shaping the trajectory leading up to the Civil War and fundamentally altering civil rights in the country.
