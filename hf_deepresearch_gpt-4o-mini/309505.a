### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The Glorious Revolution in England was primarily caused by religious conflicts, political tensions, and the actions of King James II, leading to his deposition and the accession of William III and Mary II.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Glorious Revolution, occurring between 1688 and 1689, marked a significant turning point in English history. Key causes included:

- **Religious Conflict**: King James II was a Catholic monarch in a predominantly Protestant country, which raised significant concerns among his subjects. His attempts to promote Catholicism led to growing resistance from Protestant factions and political leaders.

- **Birth of a Catholic Heir**: The birth of James II's son in June 1688 raised fears that a Catholic dynasty would follow, uniting the throne with Catholic rule, which alarmed many non-Catholics and Protestant leaders, who favored a Protestant succession.

- **Invitation to William of Orange**: Faced with these growing tensions and plotting from opposition leaders among both Whigs and Tories, several prominent Englishmen invited William of Orange—who was married to James's Protestant daughter Mary—to invade England. This invitation was not merely a reactionary effort but also demonstrated a broader desire for reform and protection from perceived tyranny.

- **James's Response and Flight**: As William's forces landed in November 1688 and advanced towards London, James's support disintegrated. He ultimately fled to France, leaving William and Mary to assume the throne. The Convention Parliament ultimately treated James's flight as an abdication, offering the crown to William and Mary, who accepted under the condition that they would uphold parliamentary law.

- **Establishment of Parliamentary Power**: The culmination of these events altered the political landscape, leading to the Bill of Rights, which established the supremacy of Parliament over the monarchy and prohibited any Catholic from the throne.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The Glorious Revolution solidified the shift from absolute monarchy towards constitutional governance in England. It was foundational for later democratic principles and the eventual development of the modern British parliamentary system.
