Tax Loopholes Exploited by the Wealthy:

- Carried Interest Loophole:
  Description: Allows hedge fund managers to pay a lower tax rate on their income. Income from investments is taxed at the capital gains rate rather than the higher ordinary income rate.
  Implication: This loophole primarily benefits hedge fund managers, and critics argue that it exacerbates income inequality.
- Offshore Tax Havens:
  Description: Wealthy individuals and corporations set up companies in low-tax jurisdictions to evade taxes.
  Implication: This practice shifts tax burdens away from the wealthy and leads to significant government revenue loss.
- Mortgage Interest Deduction:
  Description: Allows homeowners to deduct interest paid on mortgage loans from taxable income, disproportionately benefiting those with high incomes.
  Implication: While this deduction encourages home ownership, it mainly benefits wealthier individuals with larger mortgages.
