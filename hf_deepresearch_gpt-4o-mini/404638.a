    ## Comprehensive Report on What Leads to Poverty

    ### 1. Definition of Poverty
    Poverty is generally defined as the state of being unable to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter. It can be classified into absolute poverty, where individuals lack the minimum resources necessary for basic survival, and relative poverty, which reflects social inequality.

    ### 2. Common Causes of Poverty
    Common causes of poverty include:
    - **Lack of Education**: Insufficient education limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of unemployment.
    - **Unemployment**: High unemployment rates significantly contribute to poverty as individuals struggle to earn a living.
    - **Health Issues**: Chronic illness and disabilities can prevent people from working and can lead to increased healthcare costs.
    - **Economic Instability**: Economic downturns and fluctuations negatively impact job security and wages.
    - **Social Inequality**: Discrimination based on race, gender, or ethnicity restricts access to opportunities and resources.

    ### 3. Current Global Poverty Statistics
    As of 2023, approximately 689 million people live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. This equates to around 9% of the global population. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated poverty levels, especially in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.

    ### 4. Economic Theories Related to Poverty
    Key economic theories providing insights into poverty include:
    - **Classical Economics**: Emphasizes free markets and capital accumulation as solutions to poverty.
    - **Keynesian Economics**: Advocates for government intervention to stimulate demand and address unemployment.
    - **Supply-Side Economics**: Suggests lowering taxes and regulations to encourage production and job creation.
    - **Dependency Theory**: Argues that economic dependence on developed countries sustains inequality and poverty.
    - **Human Capital Theory**: Highlights education and skill development as critical for increasing earning potential.
    - **Structural Poverty Theories**: Focus on societal structures that perpetuate poverty due to discrimination and inequality.
    - **Behavioral Economics**: Examines how cognitive biases affect economic decision-making and poverty alleviation.

    ### 5. Conclusion and Policy Implications
    Understanding the complex interplay of causes, statistics, and theories surrounding poverty allows policymakers to craft informed strategies aimed at alleviating poverty through education, healthcare access, economic stability, and structural reforms.
