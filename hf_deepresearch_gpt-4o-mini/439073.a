### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Wealthy individuals have moral obligations to help the poor, rooted in both historical practices and contemporary ethical theories. Historical perspectives from figures like Karl Marx, Adam Smith, and Andrew Carnegie provide significant insights, while contemporary philosophers like Peter Singer stress the duty of affluent individuals to alleviate poverty. Ethical frameworks range from virtue ethics to utilitarianism.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The moral obligations of wealthy individuals to assist the poor has long been debated, drawing from historical precedents and contemporary philosophies.

**Historical Perspectives:**  
- **Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth":** Carnegie argued that affluent individuals are entrusted with wealth not for personal enjoyment, but for redistribution to benefit society. He believed it was their duty to contribute to the public good, framing philanthropy as a moral obligation. Carnegie stipulated that the wealthy should live modestly, manage their excess wealth to provide opportunities for the less fortunate, and inspire impoverished individuals to pursue self-improvement.  
- **Adam Smith's Views on Wealth:** Contrary to popular perception of him as an advocate of free markets, Smith recognized the plight of the poor and advocated for their welfare, underscoring the moral responsibility of society to provide support for the disadvantaged.  

**Contemporary Arguments:**  
- **Peter Singer's Ethical Framework:** Singer, a strong proponent of utilitarianism, posits that wealthy individuals should donate a significant portion of their income to alleviate global poverty. He emphasizes that even minor contributions can save lives and underscores moral accountability among the affluent.  
- **Virtue Ethics and Philanthropy:** A focus on the character of philanthropists suggests charitable acts should stem from genuine altruism rather than self-interest or a desire for influence. Philanthropy aligned with virtuous intent exemplifies ethical giving.  
- **Critique of Philanthropy:** Some academics challenge the effectiveness of philanthropy in addressing structural roots of inequality, asserting it can serve as a pacifying measure for the affluent rather than remediate inequity.

**Philosophical Discussions:**  
- **Duty vs. Choice in Charity:** The dialogue includes whether wealthy individuals should view charitable contributions as an obligation or a voluntary act of kindness. Critics of obligatory philanthropy argue that forced giving may diminish the essence of altruism and personal agency.

### 3. Additional context:
The ongoing discourse about the wealthy aiding the poor is significant, particularly amidst rising income inequality. Understanding these ethical dimensions elucidates the complexities surrounding charitable contributions. Moreover, real-world implications can be observed in how billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg navigate their philanthropic efforts in relation to societal needs and ethical expectations.
