### Comprehensive Report on Investing in Technology for Space Exploration and Colonization

#### 1. Introduction
This report evaluates whether humans should invest in technology to explore and colonize other planets based on recent advancements, funding levels, public opinion, and sustainability concerns.

#### 2. Recent Advancements
Recent technological advancements by NASA, SpaceX, and ESA show significant progress in exploration missions and efforts directed toward human colonization. Notable initiatives include:
- NASA's Artemis program and Mars exploration with the Perseverance rover.
- SpaceX's Starship program demonstrating full reusability potential and successful crewed missions.
- ESA's ongoing ExoMars rover project and Earth observation missions.

#### 3. Funding Levels and Economic Viability
Efforts to collect accurate data on funding levels and budget allocations for NASA, SpaceX, and ESA have been unsuccessful. Prior recommendations include:
- Investigating governmental budget documents.
- Monitoring press releases from the agencies involved.

#### 4. Public Opinion and Governmental Support
Gaps exist in current public sentiment research and governmental support for investments in space colonization. Recent attempts yielded no relevant results, indicating that further exploration through reputable surveys or institutional inquiries is needed.

#### 5. Sustainability and Safety Concerns
Attempts to gather information on sustainability and safety challenges for human colonization on Mars and the Moon have also faced access issues. Some specific areas that require attention include:
- Viability of living conditions and resource availability.
- Potential ecological impacts on Martian and lunar environments.

#### 6. Conclusions
While there are compelling advancements in space exploration technology, significant gaps in funding data, public support, and sustainability research hinder a thorough evaluation of humans investing in colonization efforts. Future directions should include deeper dives into accessible academic resources, institutional databases, and direct inquiries related to these challenges.

### 7. Recommendations
- Invest in further research to fill the gaps identified.
- Engage with academic and governmental institutions to gather comprehensive insights into the viability of human colonization.
- Promote ongoing public dialogue regarding the importance and implications of space exploration initiatives.
