### Report on How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Competition

#### 1. Definition and Features
Smart connected products, often referred to as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, are products embedded with sensors, software, and technologies that enable them to collect, send, and receive data over the internet. Key features include:
- **Connectivity**: Usually connected via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.
- **Data Collection**: Gather data through built-in sensors to optimize performance.
- **Remote Control**: Users can control these products through smartphone applications or computers.
- **Automation**: Many products can autonomously function based on received data.

#### 2. Applications Across Industries
- **Smart Home**: Devices (e.g., smart thermostats like Nest or smart speakers like Amazon Echo) offer energy efficiency and convenience.
- **Healthcare**: Wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit) monitor health metrics, facilitating better health management.
- **Automotive**: Connected cars provide navigation, driver assistance, and remote diagnostics.
- **Manufacturing**: Smart sensors monitor equipment performance for predictive maintenance and reduced downtime.

#### 3. Insights on Competitive Positioning
Companies leverage smart connected products to enhance operational efficiencies, create new revenue streams, and improve customer engagement.
