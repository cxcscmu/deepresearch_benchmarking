The government has significantly contributed to housing through historical policies, current budget allocations, and state-level reforms. Notable measures include a $73.3 billion request for HUD and ongoing legislative momentum addressing housing supply with 263 new bills. Despite progress, affordability remains an issue with a current median home price of $419,200, a homeownership rate of 65.7%, and cost burdening for many households. Challenges such as local opposition and regulatory complexities hinder reform effectiveness. Successful international models suggest directions for more inclusive housing strategies.
