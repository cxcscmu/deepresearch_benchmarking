### 1. Task outcome (short version):
The economic effects of the Cold War were profound and far-reaching, impacting both the Eastern and Western blocs. The conflict led to significant military expenditures, economic policies focused on defense, and ultimately shaped global economic structures.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
The Cold War (1947-1991) was characterized by geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States, resulting in distinct economic impacts across the globe. 

- **Military Expenditure**: Both superpowers engaged in an arms race, leading to enormous military spending. The United States' defense budget grew dramatically, reaching about 6% of its GDP in the 1980s as it sought to outpace the Soviet Union. The USSR similarly allocated a significant portion of its budget to defense, which subsequently strained its economy.

- **Economic Policies**: The West adopted capitalism and free market mechanisms, focusing on growth through innovation and consumerism. Conversely, the Eastern bloc, under Soviet influence, implemented centralized planning and state control over production. This resulted in inefficiency and stagnation in many Eastern economies.

- **Trade Patterns**: The Cold War altered international trade dynamics. The United States and its allies established economic institutions aimed at increasing trade among capitalist nations, whereas the Soviet Union and its allies formed the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) to facilitate trade within the Eastern bloc, often resulting in inefficiencies.

- **Global Economic Structures**: After the Cold War, many Eastern European countries transitioned to market economies, significantly impacting global economic structures. This led to rapid changes in trade relations and economic policies, especially in countries once part of the Soviet Union. 

- **Long-term Consequences**: The Cold Warâ€™s end saw significant economic restructuring in former communist countries, with initial economic turmoil leading to varying degrees of success in transitioning to market economies, influencing global supply chains and economic conditions in the late 20th century and into the 21st century.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
Understanding the economic effects of the Cold War provides crucial insights into current global economic conflicts and alignments. The legacy of economic policies and divisions from this era continue to influence geopolitical relations today.
