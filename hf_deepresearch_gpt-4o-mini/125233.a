### 1. Task outcome (short version):
Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve specific academic articles or official reports analyzing U.S. military success in learning from historical conflicts since 1945 due to technical limitations in executing web searches.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
Despite repeated attempts, the search for academic or official reports that analyze lessons learned by the U.S. military from conflicts since 1945 was unsuccessful due to the limitations on executing queries pertaining to this topic.

However, it is known that several major conflicts, such as the Vietnam War, Gulf War, Iraq War, and Afghanistan War, have generated extensive analysis and reports regarding operational successes and failures. Reports from institutions such as the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Army War College, and RAND Corporation typically contain detailed discussions on lessons learned from these operations. The general consensus in existing literature highlights themes such as the importance of adapting to counterinsurgency warfare, the necessity of inter-agency cooperation, and effective use of intelligence in operations. Accessing military libraries or dedicated academic resources could yield useful materials on this topic.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
To gain insight into U.S. military adaptations post-1945, I recommend exploring academic databases like JSTOR or Google Scholar directly. Additionally, consulting reports from military-focused think tanks or governmental websites may provide comprehensive analyses of lessons learned from significant military operations.
