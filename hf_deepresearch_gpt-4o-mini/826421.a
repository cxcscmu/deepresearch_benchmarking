### 1. Task outcome (short version):
In 2023, various studies show that nurses spend considerable time documenting with Electronic Health Records (EHR), typically ranging from 30% up to two-thirds of their total work hours. Implementations of EHR can either reduce or exacerbate documentation time depending on several factors including the type of technology used.

### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
- **Study 1:** A study published in September 2023 found that nurses using an electronic medical record-connected questionnaire saved 13%-18% of their documentation time, roughly 1.3 to 2 minutes less per task, leading to improved efficiency in certain patient care contexts but not equally in all settings.
- **Study 2:** Another study highlighted that nurses reported spending between 30% to 50% of their working hours on EHR documentation. Though many perceived EHRs as enhancing efficiency, there is concern that this time commitment detracts from direct patient care.
- **Study 3:** Research from a systematic review indicated that nurses can spend as much as 65% of their shifts on documentation, depending on the unit and processes in place. Issues with user interface design, redundant entry, and compliance requirements contribute significantly to this burden.
- **Study 4:** Additionally, another report noted that certain EHR systems, such as bedside terminals, reduced documentation time by about 24.5%, whereas handheld devices increased time spent by approximately 128.4%. This underscores the importance of system selection in improving documentation efficiency.

### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
The findings collectively emphasize a crucial area of concern within nursing and healthcare informatics regarding how EHRs affect clinical documentation practices. Efforts to streamline these processes are necessary not only to improve nurse efficiency but also to enhance the quality of patient care. The diverse range of findings illustrates that not all EHR systems perform equally, suggesting that further evaluation and optimization of EHR technology is essential.
